This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. \n#Person2#: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want.\n#Person1#: You mean you don't keep regular hours?\n#Person2#: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early.\n#Person1#: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?\n#Person2#: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers.\n#Person1#: Thank you, Mr. Kayne.

That was how we started the program called Golden Country Time.\n#Person1#: Then you were asked to write articles to explain the background of those songs.\n#Person2#: Yes, but soon I got tired of running to the library to find information.
