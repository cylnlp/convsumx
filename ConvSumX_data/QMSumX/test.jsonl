{"fname": "academic_test_1", "dialogue": "professor c: Uh, is it the twenty - fourth?\nphd f: now we 're on.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh Chuck, is the mike type wireless \nphd f: Yes.\nphd a: wireless headset? OK.\nphd f: Yes.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: For you it is.\nprofessor c: Yeah. We uh we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too not too hot, not too cold, they were you know, they were uh, far enough away that you got more background noise, uh, and uh and so forth\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: but they weren't so close that they got quite the you know, the really good No, th\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: they I mean they didn't Wait a minute. I 'm saying that wrong. They were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference. So it was no didn't seem to be a good point to them. On the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice, precisely because it's in the middle.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: There's uh, some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel uh, little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel, but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh, getting rid of lapels.\nphd a: The mike number is \nprofessor c: So,\nphd f: Uh, your mike number's written on the back of that unit there.\nphd a: Oh yeah. One.\nphd f: And then the channel number's usually one less than that.\nphd a: Oh, OK. OK.\nphd f: It - it's one less than what's written on the back of your \nphd a: OK. OK.\nphd f: yeah. So you should be zero, actually.\nphd a: Hello? Yeah.\nphd f: For your uh, channel number.\nphd a: Yep, yep.\nprofessor c: And you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations. no, they don't don't have a have any Indian pronunciations.\nphd f: So what we usually do is um, we typically will have our meetings\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits. Everybody goes around and reads the digits on the the bottom of their forms.\nprofessor c: Session R\nphd d: R - nineteen?\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: R - nineteen.\nphd f: Yeah. We 're This is session R - nineteen.\nprofessor c: If you say so. O K. Do we have anything like an agenda? What's going on? Um. I guess um. So. One thing \nphd f: Sunil's here for the summer?\nprofessor c: Sunil's here for the summer, right. Um, so, one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh, and then just uh, I guess uh, progress reports individually, and then uh, plans for where we go between now and then, pretty much. Um.\nphd f: I could say a few words about um, some of the uh, compute stuff that's happening around here, so that people in the group know.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm. OK. Why don't you start with that? That's sort of \nphd f: OK.\nprofessor c: Yeah?\nphd f: We um So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines, uh, to use as sort of a compute farm. And um, uh, we ordered uh, SUN - Blade - one - hundreds, and um, I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in, but, uh, in addition, we 're running So the plan for using these is, uh, we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh, fixed up and up to speed. And he's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um, run things using P - make and Customs. You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that. The simplest thing And I can send an email around or, maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something. Um,\nprofessor c: How about an email that points to the FAQ,\nphd f: there's a c\nprofessor c: you know what I 'm saying?\nphd f: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: so that you can Yeah.\nphd f: Uh, there's a command, uh, that you can use called \" run command \". \" Run dash command \", \" run hyphen command \". And, if you say that and then some job that you want to execute, uh, it will find the fastest currently available machine, and export your job to that machine, and uh and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment. So you can try this as a simple test with uh, the L S command. So you can say \" run dash command L S \", and, um, it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute, and um, do an LS on your current directory. So, substitute LS for whatever command you want to run, and um And that's a simple way to get started using using this. And, so, soon, when we get all the new machines up, um, e then we 'll have lots more compute to use. Now th one of the nice things is that uh, each machine that's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it. Uh, attributes like how much memory the machine has, what its speed is, what its operating system, and when you use something like \" run command \", you can specify those attributes for your program. For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux, you can give it the Linux attribute, and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that. So. You can control where your jobs go, to a certain extent, all the way down to an individual machine. Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself. So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that. If there's already a job running, on some machine that you 're trying to select, your job will get queued up, and then when that resource, that machine becomes available, your job will get exported there. So, there's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh, right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're Uh. The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it.\nprofessor c: So as I understand, you know, he's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines,\nphd f: So.\nprofessor c: is the rough division of \nphd f: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, you know, I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently and uh, uh I fired off a training job, and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying, \" uh, are you running two trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run. \" So I had to back off a little bit. But, soon as we get some more machines then uh then we 'll have more compute available. So, um, that's just a quick update about what we 've got. So.\ngrad g: Um, I have I have a question about the uh, parallelization?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: So, um, let's say I have like, a thousand little little jobs to do?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Um, how do I do it with \" run command \"? I mean do \nphd f: You could write a script uh, which called run command on each sub - job\ngrad g: Uh - huh. A thousand times?\nphd f: right? But you probably wanna be careful with that\ngrad g: OK.\nphd f: because um, you don't wanna saturate the network. Uh, so, um, you know, you should you should probably not run more than, say ten jobs yourself at any one time, uh, just because then it would keep other people \ngrad g: Oh, too much file transfer and stuff.\nphd f: Well it's not that so much as that, you know, e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and, you know, people's jobs would get delayed, so it's sort of a sharing thing. Um,\ngrad g: OK.\nphd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time. Um. So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run, um, you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \", uh, to only have ten of those going at a time. And uh, then, when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one. Um,\nprofessor c: I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop, I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out.\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine.\nphd f: Yeah. Yep. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you have to be a little bit careful.\nprofessor c: as I recall, but. Yeah.\nphd d: Hmm.\nphd f: Um, but uh, you can also If you have that level of parallelization um, and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that, you can use um, P - make\ngrad g: Just do P - make.\nphd f: and and you basically write a Make file that uh, you know your final job depends on these one thousand things,\ngrad g: s Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and when you run P - make, uh, on your Make file, you can give it the dash capital J and and then a number,\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and that number represents how many uh, machines to use at once. And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd f: So,\ngrad g: Right. OK.\nphd f: I can get some documentation.\nphd d: So it it's it's not systematically queued. I mean all the jobs are running. If you launch twenty jobs, they are all running. Alright.\nphd f: It depends. If you \" Run command \", that I mentioned before, is doesn't know about other things that you might be running.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nphd f: So, it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once,\nphd d: Right.\nphd f: and they wouldn't know about each other. But if you use P - make, then, it knows about all the jobs that it has to run\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and it can control, uh, how many it runs simultaneously.\nprofessor c: So \" run command \" doesn't use P - make, or?\nphd f: It uses \" export \" underlyingly. But, if you i It's meant to be run one job at a time? So you could fire off a thousand of those, and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running.\nprofessor c: So why would one use that rather than P - make?\nphd f: Well, if you have, um Like, for example, uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script and you just had a, uh an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh, six hours to run, and somebody's using, uh, the machine you typically use, you can say \" run command \" and your HTK thing and it 'll find another machine, the fastest currently available machine and and run your job there.\nprofessor c: Now, does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make, which is that, you know, if you run something on somebody's machine and they come in and hit a key then it \nphd f: Yes. Yeah, there are um Right. So some of the machines at the institute, um, have this attribute called \" no evict \". And if you specify that, in in one of your attribute lines, then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: But, the machines that don't have that attribute, if a job gets fired up on that, which could be somebody's desktop machine, and and they were at lunch,\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console, then your machine will get evicted your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine. Automatically. So which can cause you to lose time, right? If you had a two hour job, and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted. So. If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted, then you give it the minus the attribute, you know, \" no evict \", and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from. So.\nprofessor c: Um, what what about I remember always used to be an issue, maybe it's not anymore, that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work, but if you were logged into it from home?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and you weren't hitting any keys? cuz you were, home?\nphd f: Yeah, I I 'm not sure how that works.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: Uh, it seems like Andreas did something for that.\nprofessor c: Hmm.\nphd f: Um.\nprofessor c: OK. We can ask him sometime.\nphd f: But Yeah. I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY, so maybe if you echoed something to the you know, dev dev console or something.\nprofessor c: You probably wouldn't ordinarily, though. Yeah. Right? You probably wouldn't ordinarily.\nphd f: Hmm?\nprofessor c: I mean you sort of you 're at home and you 're trying to log in, and it takes forever to even log you in, and you probably go, \" screw this \",\nphd f: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: and You know.\nphd f: Yeah. Yeah, so, um,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: yeah. I I can I 'm not sure about that one.\nprofessor c: yeah.\nphd f: But uh.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: Uh, I need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because I never d did anything so far with this X emissions\nphd f: OK.\nphd a: So, I think maybe I 'll ask you after the meeting.\nphd f: Um. Yeah. Yeah, and and also uh, Stephane's a a really good resource for that if you can't find me.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. OK, sure\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd f: Especially with regard to the Aurora stuff.\nphd a: OK.\nphd f: He he knows that stuff better than I do.\nprofessor c: OK. Well, why don't we uh, uh, Sunil since you 're haven't haven't been at one of these yet, why don't yo you tell us what's what's up with you? Wh - what you 've been up to, hopefully.\nphd a: Um. Yeah. So, uh, shall I start from Well I don't know how may I how OK. Uh, I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh, yeah, after the submission the what I 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions and then over their system, what they submitted, because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in in ours. So So I tried uh, And u First I tried just LDA. And then I found that uh, I mean, if if I combine it with LDA, it gives @ @ improvement over theirs. Uh \nphd f: Are y are you saying LDA?\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd f: LDA. OK.\nphd a: So, just just the LDA filters. I just plug in I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that. But the LDA filter that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: What I did was I took the LDA filter's design using clean speech, uh, mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so, instead of using this, uh, narrow narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh, I got new filters. So that seems to be giving uh, improving over their uh, system. Slightly. But, not very significantly. And uh, that was uh, showing any improvement over final by plugging in an LDA. And uh, so then after after that I I added uh, on - line normalization also on top of that. And that there there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech, and whatever we try it on with proposal - one. But um, I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot, I just t g I just found that I have to reduce the value I mean, I have to increase the time constant, or reduce the value of the update value. That's all I found So I have to. Uh, Yeah. And uh, uh, the other other thing what I tried was, I just um, uh, took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information, just the Aurora baseline, to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the I mean the w speech and nonspeech. And uh, I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh.\nprofessor c: Uh, can you back up a second, I I I missed something, uh, I guess my mind wandered. Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth, uh, uh things got better again?\nphd a: Yeah. No.\nprofessor c: or is it?\nphd a: No. No, things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used.\nprofessor c: Did it not? No, no. With a different time constant.\nphd a: With the different time constant I found that I mean, I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization,\nprofessor c: Oh.\nphd a: because I I found that I would have change the value of the update factor.\nprofessor c: No you didn't, OK.\nphd a: But I didn't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: So, it's still not \nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: I mean, the on - line normalization didn't give me any improvement.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: And uh, so,\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: oh yeah So I just stopped there with the uh, speech enhancement. The the other thing what I tried was the adding the uh, endpoint information to the baseline and that itself gives like twenty - two percent because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech. And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information, I just, uh, use \nprofessor c: Hmm.\nphd f: So people won't even have to worry about, uh, doing speech - nonspeech then.\nphd a: Yeah that's, that's what the feeling is like. They 're going to give the endpoint information.\nphd f: Mmm.\nprofessor c: G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway,\nphd f: I see.\nprofessor c: everybody does that,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and they wanted to see, given that you 're doing that, what what are the best features that you should use.\nphd f: Yeah, I see.\nphd a: So,\nprofessor c: I mean clearly they 're interact. So I don't know that I entirely agree with it.\nphd f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But but it might be uh In some ways it might be better t to rather than giving the endpoints, to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But, you know. It's it's still someth reasonable.\nphd f: So, are people supposed to assume that there is uh Are are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints?\nphd a: Uh \nphd f: Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things?\nphd a: No. No. That i I Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I guess that is that is where the consensus is. Like y you will you will You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech but the whole speech is available to you.\nphd f: OK.\nphd a: So.\nprofessor c: So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: because you don't have the mistakes in it. Yeah?\nphd a: Yeah. So \nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: So that that The baseline itself I mean, it improves by twenty - two percent. I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases, that like, the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint. w\nphd f: Wow.\nphd a: I mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty. So, uh,\nphd f: So the baseline itself improves by fifty percent.\nphd a: Yeah, by fifty percent.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd f: Wow.\nprofessor c: So it's g it's gonna be harder to beat that actually.\nphd f: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah, so \nprofessor c: But but \nphd a: so that is when uh, the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched. And I think they have they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now. And uh, Yeah, I guess after that, I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks. Uh.\nprofessor c: OK. No, that's that's that's a good good update.\nphd a: Ye Yeah, and I I came back and I started working on uh, some other speech enhancement algorithm. I mean, so I from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering. These are the main uh, approaches where people have tried,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: so just to just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot, I I 've been working on this uh, signal subspace approach for speech enhancement where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace. And \nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So, I 've been actually running some s So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab. I have to to to test whether it works first or not\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then I 'll p port it to C and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result. So, yeah.\nprofessor c: S So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second. So so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and so we we 'll have a single place where the stuff is.\nphd a: Yep. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Cool. Um, so maybe uh, just briefly, you could remind us about the related experiments. Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week, I guess?\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Um, where you were also combining something both of you I guess were both combining something from the uh, French Telecom system with the u uh \nphd d: Right.\nprofessor c: I I don't know whether it was system one or system two, or?\nphd d: Mm - hmm. It was system one. So\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd d: we The main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the France Telecom, which provide us some speech samples that are uh, with noise removed.\nprofessor c: So I let me let me just stop you there. So then, one distinction is that uh, you were taking the actual France Telecom features and then applying something to \nphd a: Uh, no there is a slight different. Uh I mean, which are extracted at the handset because they had another back - end blind equalization \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah. But that's what I mean.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But u u Sorry,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: yeah, I 'm not being I 'm not being clear.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something, right?\nphd a: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: And so one difference is that, I guess you were taking spectra.\nphd a: The speech.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah. But I guess it's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads uh, handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features,\nphd a: Yeah, the cepstral f The difference is like There may be a slight difference in the way \nphd d: right? or?\nphd a: because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech. I mean, if we are using our own code for th I mean that that could be the only difference.\nphd d: Right.\nphd a: I mean, there is no other difference.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But you got some sort of different result. So I 'm trying to understand it. But uh, I th\nphd d: Yeah, well I think we should uh, have a table with all the result because I don't know I uh, I don't exactly know what are your results? But,\nphd a: OK. OK.\nphd d: Mmm. Yeah, but so we did this, and another difference I guess is that we just applied uh, proposal - one system after this without well, with our modification to reduce the delay of the the LDA filters,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd d: and\nphd b: And the filter \nphd d: Well there are slight modifications, but it was the full proposal - one. In your case, if you tried just putting LDA, then maybe on - line normalization?\nphd a: Only LDA. Yeah. Af - I after that I added on - line normalization, yeah.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. So we just tried directly to to just, keep the system as it was and, um, when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh, signif significantly. Um, but, what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nphd d: Because if we keep the value that was submitted uh, it doesn't help at all. You can remove on - line normalization, or put it, it doesn't change anything. Uh, uh, as long as you have the spectral subtraction. But, you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere, and we don't know where exactly\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: but, uh.\nphd a: Yeah, I assume.\nprofessor c: So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something\nphd d: Right.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and see where i where the where they were different and what we can learn from it.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: without any change. OK.\nphd b: But it's \nphd d: Yeah. Well,\nphd b: It's the new.\nphd d: with with with changes,\nphd a: with\nphd b: The new.\nphd d: because we change it the system to have \nphd a: Oh yeah, I mean the the new LDA filters.\nphd b: The new.\nphd a: I mean OK.\nphd d: Yeah. LDA filters. There are other things that we finally were shown to improve also like, the sixty - four hertz cut - off.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: w Uh, it doesn't seem to hurt on TI - digits, finally.\nphd a: OK.\nphd d: Maybe because of other changes.\nphd a: OK.\nphd d: Um, well there are some minor changes, yeah.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And, right now if we look at the results, it's, um, always better than it seems always better than France Telecom for mismatch and high - mismatch. And it's still slightly worse for well - matched.\nphd b: But\nphd d: Um, but this is not significant. But, the problem is that it's not significant, but if you put this in the, mmm, uh, spreadsheet, it's still worse. Even with very minor uh, even if it's only slightly worse for well - matched.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And significantly better for HM. Uh, but, well. I don't think it's importa important because when they will change their metric, uh, uh, mainly because of uh, when you p you plug the um, frame dropping in the baseline system, it will improve a lot HM, and MM,\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: so, um, I guess what will happen I don't know what will happen. But, the different contribution, I think, for the different test set will be more even.\nphd a: Because the your improvement on HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet so. But the the well - matched may still \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information.\nprofessor c: Right.\nphd a: Yeah. So the the MM \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: MM and HM are going to be v hugely affected by it. Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah, so um, yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. But they d the everything I mean is like, but there that's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But are they changing the weighting?\nphd a: Uh, no, I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. So there's nothing on \nprofessor c: I don't understand that.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: I guess I I haven't been part of the discussion, so, um, it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual,\nphd a: Usual.\nprofessor c: in this case. Unusual.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: Because, um, you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person's car is like, or\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: uh,\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: It seems like something like the middle one is is more natural.\nphd a: Hmm. Right.\nprofessor c: So I don't know why the well - matched is uh \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah, but actually the well well the well - matched um, uh, I mean the the well - matched condition is not like, uh, the one in TI - digits where uh, you have all the training, uh, conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also. It's like, this is not calibrated by SNR or something. The well - matched has also some some mismatch in that which is other than the \nprofessor c: The well wa matched has mismatch?\nphd a: has has also some slight mismatches, unlike the TI - digits where it's like prefectly matched\nphd f: Perfect to match.\nphd a: because it's artificially added noise.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: But this is natural recording.\nprofessor c: Yeah. So remind me of what well - matched meant?\nphd a: The the well - matched is like \nprofessor c: You 've told me many times.\nphd a: the the well - matched is defined like it's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing.\nphd d: Yeah. Well, so it means that if the database is large enough, it's matched.\nphd a: It's it's \nphd d: Because it\nphd a: OK, it's \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd d: in each set you have a range of conditions Well \nprofessor c: Right. So, I mean, yeah, unless they deliberately chose it to be different, which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched, it is pretty much You know, so it's so it's sort of saying if you \nphd f: It's it's not guaranteed though.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, it's not guaranteed.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Right.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah because the m the main major reason for the m\nprofessor c: Right.\nphd a: the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually.\nprofessor c: Again, if you have enough if you have enough \nphd a: No yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: So it's sort of i i it's sort of saying OK, so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer, um, you you have a car, and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions, or something, and then I don't think that's very realistic, I mean I th\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: I I you know, so I I I you know, I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially, that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars, and and you would have something that was roughly similar and maybe that's the argument, but I 'm not sure I buy it, so.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, So What else is going on?\nphd d: Mmm. You Yeah. We are playing we are also playing, trying to put other spectral subtraction mmm, in the code. Um, it would be a very simple spectral subtraction, on the um, mel energies which I already tested but without the um frame dropping actually, and I think it's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction.\nphd f: Is it is spectral subtraction typically done on the after the mel, uh, scaling or is it done on the FFT bins?\nphd d: Um,\nphd f: Does it matter, or?\nphd d: I d I don't know. Well, it's both both uh, cases can i\nphd f: Oh.\nphd d: Yeah. So - some of the proposal, uh, we 're doing this on the bin on the FFT bins,\nphd f: Hmm.\nphd d: others on the um, mel energies. You can do both, but I cannot tell you what's which one might be better or I \nphd f: Hmm.\nphd a: I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech, it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins.\nphd d: I don't know. Yeah, but\nphd f: Mmm.\nphd a: But for speech recognition, it may not. I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT. So you 're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that.\nphd f: I see.\nphd a: Well Yeah?\nphd f: Hmm.\nphd a: So, it may not be really a big different.\nphd d: Well, it gives something different, but I don't know what are the, pros and cons of both.\nphd a: It I Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: Hmm.\nphd a: So\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique, uh, is it like one stage speech enhancement? Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals, which is really giving them some improvement.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean they just do the same thing again once more.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And So, there's something that is good about doing it I mean, to cleaning it up once more.\nphd d: Yeah, it might be.\nphd a: Yeah,\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: so we can \nphd d: So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing\nphd a: Yeah. That's what\nprofessor c: Well, the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing.\nphd d: and Yeah.\nprofessor c: I mean maybe one or one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first.\nphd a: That's wh Yeah. So,\nprofessor c: Right, so he's doing a signal subspace thing, maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction, or maybe vi maybe the other way around,\nphd d: Yeah, mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: you know?\nphd a: So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: How is it I I guess I 'm ignorant about this, how does I mean, since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals, how is how is that differ from signal subspace?\nphd a: The signal subspace? The \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: The signal subspace approach has actually an in - built Wiener filtering in it.\nprofessor c: Oh, OK.\nphd a: Yeah. It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter. Is the signal is is a signal substrate.\nprofessor c: Oh, oh, OK so the difference is the KL.\nphd a: So, the the different the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad. It's it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions, and in colored noise.\nprofessor c: I see. So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform, followed by a\nphd a: Wiener filtering. It's a it's a cascade of two s\nprofessor c: Wiener filter. Yeah, in general, you don't that's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy. Actually. Um, that was something that uh, Herve and I were talking about with um, the multi - band stuff, that if you 're converting things to from uh, bands, groups of bands into cepstral coef you know, local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it's not that great to do it if it's noisy.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. OK. Yeah. So.\nprofessor c: Uh, so.\nphd a: So that that's one reason maybe we could combine s some something to improve SNR a little bit, first stage,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further.\nphd d: What was your point about about colored noise there?\nphd a: Oh, the colored noise uh \nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has I mean, it it actually depends on inverting the matrices. So it it ac the covariance matrix of the noise. So if if it is not positive definite,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean it has a it's It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite.\nprofessor c: So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise.\nphd a: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering, first of the colo colored noise\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then make the noise white,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back, you do this filtering again.\nphd d: Yeah, right.\nprofessor c: I was only half kidding. I mean if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction, that also gets rid \nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and then you then then add a little bit l noise noise addition I mean, that sort of what J JRASTA does, in a way.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise,\nphd a: Huh? Uh - huh.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: in order to get rid of the effects of noise.\nphd a: So.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd d: Yeah. Uh, yeah. So there is this. And maybe we well we find some people so that uh, agree to maybe work with us, and they have implementation of VTS techniques so it's um, Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm, uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra. So. Well, if you take the standard model of channel plus noise, uh, it's it's a nonlinear eh uh, transformation in the cepstral domain.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm. Yes.\nphd d: And uh, there is a way to approximate this using uh, first - order or second - order Taylor Series and it can be used for uh, getting rid of the noise and the channel effect.\nprofessor c: Who is doing this?\nphd d: Uh w working in the cepstral domain? So there is one guy in Grenada,\nphd b: Yeah, in Grenada one of my friend.\nphd d: and another in uh, Lucent that I met at ICASSP.\nprofessor c: Who's the guy in Grenada?\nphd d: uh,\nphd b: Uh, Jose Carlos Segura.\nprofessor c: I don't know him.\nphd a: This VTS has been proposed by CMU?\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Is it is it the CMU? Yeah, yeah, OK.\nphd b: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Originally the idea was from CMU.\nphd a: From C.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh - huh.\nphd d: Well, it's again a different thing that could be tried. Um,\nprofessor c: Uh - huh.\nphd d: Mmm, yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah, so at any rate, you 're looking general, uh, standing back from it, looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh, noise removal, uh, with with these other things we have,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: uh, looks like a worthy thing to to do here.\nphd d: Uh, yeah. But, yeah. But for sure there's required to that requires to re - check everything else, and re - optimize the other things\nprofessor c: Oh yeah.\nphd d: and, for sure the on - line normalization may be the LDA filter. Um,\nprofessor c: Well one of the seems like one of the things to go through next week when Hari's here,\nphd d: I \nprofessor c: cuz Hari 'll have his own ideas too or I guess not next week,\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: week and a half, uh, will be sort of go through these alternatives, what we 've seen so far, and come up with some game plans. Um. You know. So, I mean one way would he Here are some alternate visions. I mean one would be, you look at a few things very quickly, you pick on something that looks like it's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing. Another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things, and and you know, have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what's better,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and then, you know, uh, but, w um, uh, he 'll have some ideas on that too.\nphd a: The other thing is to, uh Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks. But we we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage, which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all. So, there are some I mean, I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks and spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks. And it's Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere. But if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction, we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @.\nprofessor c: So they 're making there Somebody's generating Wall Street Journal with additive artificially added noise or something?\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Sort of a sort of like what they did with TI - digits, and?\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah, OK.\nphd a: I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that. Guenter Hirsch and TI.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd a: Maybe Roger r Roger, maybe in charge of.\nprofessor c: And then they 're they 're uh, uh, generating HTK scripts to \nphd a: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. There are they have there is no I don't know if they are converging on HTK or are using some Mississippi State,\nprofessor c: Mis - Mississippi State maybe,\nphd a: yeah. I 'm not sure about that.\nprofessor c: yeah. Yeah, so that 'll be a little little task in itself.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Um, well we 've Yeah, it's true for the additive noise, y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too. But for n there's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News. So we we did the Broadcast News evaluation\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and some of the focus conditions were noisy and and \nphd a: It had additive n\nprofessor c: But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction. We were doing our funny stuff, right? We were doing multi multi uh, multi - stream and and so forth.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But it, you know, we di stuff we did helped. I mean it, did something.\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: So. Um, now we have this um, meeting data. You know, like the stuff we 're recording right now,\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: and and uh, that we have uh, for the uh, the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually. It's the far field mike. And uh, we have uh, the digits that we do at the end of these things. And that's what most o again, most of our work has been done with that, with with uh, connected digits.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: Um, but uh, we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech, large vocabulary continuous speech, using Switchboard uh, Switchboard recognizer,\nphd a: Yeah. OK.\nprofessor c: uh, no training, from this, just just plain using the Switchboard.\nphd a: Oh. You just take the Switchboard trained? Yeah,\nprofessor c: That's that's what we 're doing,\nphd a: yeah.\nprofessor c: yeah. Now there are some adaptation though,\nphd a: OK. Yeah. That's cool.\nprofessor c: that that uh, Andreas has been playing with,\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: but we 're hop uh, actually uh, Dave and I were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future, trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on, uh, some of the large vocabulary data. Um, I mean, I guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh, the SRI recognizer and, uh,\nphd f: I don't not that I know of.\nprofessor c: Yeah, cuz everybody's scared.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: You 'll see a little smoke coming up from the the CPU or something trying to trying to do it,\nphd f: That's right\nprofessor c: but uh, yeah. But, you 're right that that that's a real good point, that uh, we we don't know yeah, uh, I mean, what if any of these ta I guess that's why they 're pushing that in the uh in the evaluation.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, But um, Good. OK. Anything else going on? at you guys ' end,\nphd b: I don't have good result, with the inc including the new parameters,\nprofessor c: or?\nphd b: I don't have good result. Are similar or a little bit worse.\nphd a: With what what other new p new parameter?\ngrad g: You 're talking about your voicing?\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So maybe You probably need to back up a bit\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: seeing as how Sunil,\nphd b: I tried to include another new parameter to the traditional parameter,\nprofessor c: yeah.\nphd b: the coe the cepstrum coefficient,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd b: that, like, the auto - correlation, the R - zero and R - one over R - zero\nphd a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and another estimation of the var the variance of the difference for of the spec si uh, spectrum of the signal and and the spectrum of time after filt mel filter bank.\nphd a: I 'm so sorry. I didn't get it.\nphd b: Nuh. Well. Anyway. The First you have the sp the spectrum of the signal,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and you have the on the other side you have the output of the mel filter bank.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: You can extend the coefficient of the mel filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal.\nphd a: Mmm. OK.\nphd b: I do the difference \nphd a: OK.\nphd b: I found a difference at the variance of this different\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd b: because, suppose we we think that if the variance is high, maybe you have n uh, noise.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: And if the variance is small, maybe you have uh, speech.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd b: To to To The idea is to found another feature for discriminate between voice sound and unvoice sound.\nphd a: OK.\nphd b: And we try to use this new feature feature. And I did experiment I need to change to obtain this new feature I need to change the size the window size size. of the a of the analysis window size, to have more information.\nphd a: Yeah. Make it longer.\nphd b: Uh, sixty - two point five milliseconds I think.\nphd a: OK.\nphd b: And I do I did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the with the other feature and to train a neural network to select it voice - unvoice - silence silence\nphd a: Unvoiced. Well.\nphd b: and to to concat this new feature. But the result are n with the neural network I have more or less the same result.\nphd a: As using just the cepstrum,\nphd b: Result.\nphd a: or?\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: OK.\nphd b: Yeah. It's neve e e sometime it's worse, sometime it's a little bit better, but not significantly.\nphd a: Uh, is it with TI - digits, or with?\nphd b: And No, I work with eh, Italian and Spanish basically.\nphd a: OK. OK.\nphd b: And if I don't y use the neural network, and use directly the feature the results are worse.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd b: But Doesn't help.\nprofessor c: I I I really wonder though.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: I mean we 've had these discussions before, and and one of the things that struck me was that uh, about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um whenever you condense things, uh, in an irreversible way, um, you throw away some information. And, that's mostly viewed on as a good thing, in the way we use it, because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular, uh, phonetic units. Um, but, you 'll do throw something away. And so the question is, uh, can we figure out if there's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have. And um. So, when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank, I was thinking \" oh, OK, so they 're picking on something they 're looking on it to figure out noise, or voice voiced property whatever. \" So that that's interesting. Maybe that helps to drive the the thought process of coming up with the features. But for me sort of the interesting thing was, \" well, but is there just something in that difference which is useful? \" So another way of doing it, maybe, would be just to take the FFT uh, power spectrum, and feed it into a neural network,\nphd b: To know \nprofessor c: and then use it, you know, in combination, or alone, or or whatever\nphd f: Wi - with what targets?\nphd a: Voiced, unvoiced is like \nprofessor c: Uh, no.\nphd a: Oh. Or anything.\nprofessor c: No the just the same same way we 're using I mean, the same way that we 're using the filter bank.\nphd f: Phones.\nphd a: Oh, OK.\nprofessor c: Exact way the same way we 're using the filter bank.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: I mean, the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it's good. But it's different. And, you know, maybe if it's used in combination, it will get at something that we 're missing. And maybe, you know, using, orth you know, KLT, or uh, um, adding probabilities, I mean, all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with, that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that's useful, that we 're missing here.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Yeah, but there is so much variability in the power spectrum.\nprofessor c: Well, that's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself, but it might help in combination.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mmm.\nprofessor c: But I I I have to tell you, I can't remember the conference, but, uh, I think it's about ten years ago, I remember going to one of the speech conferences and and uh, I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something, and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh, just putting in the FFT and the FFT did slightly better. So I mean the i i It's true there's lots of variability,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that a that variability, and you know, doing something reasonable with it.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So, um, uh, It - it's same, you know, argument that's gone both ways about uh, you know, we have these data driven filters, in LDA, and on the other hand, if it's data driven it means it's driven by things that have lots of variability, and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test, so, in some ways it's good to have data driven things, and in some ways it's bad to have data driven things. So,\nphd a: Yeah, d\nprofessor c: part of what we 're discovering, is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, so anyway, it's just a thought, that that if we if we had that maybe it's just a baseline uh, which would show us \" well, what are we really getting out of the filters \", or maybe i i probably not by itself, but in combination, uh,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: you know, maybe there's something to be gained from it, and let the But, you know, y you 've only worked with us for a short time, maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information. But, maybe the neural net and the H M Ms could figure it out quicker than you.\nphd b: Maybe.\nprofessor c: So.\nphd b: Yeah,\nprofessor c: It's just a thought.\nphd b: I can I will try to do that.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: What one one um p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora, the th what we did was like, I I guess most of you know about this, adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: That is just a binary feature and that seems to be improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise but not much on the TI - digits. So, a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping. That's it.\nphd d: Wait I I 'm sorry?\nphd a: Yeah, we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum, just the baseline.\nphd d: Yeah?\nphd b: You did some experiment.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah. Well, in in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything, because there wasn't any f anything to discriminate between speech,\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: and it was very short. But Italian was like very it was a huge improvement on Italian.\nphd d: Hmm. Well Mm - hmm. But anyway the question is even more, is within speech, can we get some features? Are we drop dropping information that can might be useful within speech,\nphd a: OK.\nphd d: I mean. To maybe to distinguish between voice sound and unvoiced sounds?\nphd a: Mm - hmm. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: And it's particularly more relevant now since we 're gonna be given the endpoints.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh. So.\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: Um.\nphd a: There was a paper in ICASSP this ICASSP over the uh extracting some higher - order uh, information from the cepstral coefficients and I forgot the name. Some is some harmonics I don't know, I can I can pull that paper out from ICASSP. It \nprofessor c: Talking cumulants or something?\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Huh? Uh, I don't know.\nprofessor c: Cumulants or something.\nphd a: I don't remember.\nprofessor c: But No.\nphd a: It wa it was taking the, um It was about finding the higher - order moments of Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah,\nphd a: And I 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments, or \nprofessor c: cumulants, yeah.\nphd a: maybe higher - order cumulants\nprofessor c: Oh.\nphd a: and Yeah. It was it was \nprofessor c: Or m e\nphd a: Yeah. I mean, he was showing up uh some something on noisy speech,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: some improvement on the noisy speech.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Some small vocabulary tasks.\nprofessor c: Uh.\nphd a: So it was on PLP derived cepstral coefficients.\nprofessor c: Yeah, but again You could argue that th that's exactly what the neural network does.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: So n neural network uh, is in some sense equivalent to computing, you know, higher - order moments of what you \nphd a: trying to f to Moments, yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: yeah. So. I mean, it doesn't do it very specifically,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and pretty you know. But.\nphd a: Yep.\nprofessor c: Uh, anything on your end you want to talk about? Uh.\ngrad g: Um, nothing I wanna really talk about. I can I can just uh, um, share a little bit Sunil hasn't hasn't heard about uh, what I 've been doing.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad g: Um, so, um, I told you I was I was I was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam. So basically that's just, um, trying to propose um, uh, your next your your following years of of your PHD work, trying trying to find a project to to define and and to work on. So, I 've been, uh, looking into, um, doing something about r uh, speech recognition using acoustic events. So, um, the idea is you have all these these different events, for example voicing, nasality, R - coloring, you know burst or noise, uh, frication, that kinda stuff, um, building robust um, primary detectors for these acoustic events, and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition. Um, and, um, these these primary detectors, um, will be, uh, inspired by, you know, multi - band techniques, um, doing things, um, similar to Larry Saul's work on, uh, graphical models to to detect these these, uh, acoustic events. And, um, so I I been I been thinking about that and some of the issues that I 've been running into are, um, exactly what what kind of acoustic events I need, what um, what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps. And, also, um, once I decide a set of acoustic events, um, h how do I how do I get labels? Training data for for these acoustic events. And, then later on down the line, I can start playing with the the models themselves, the the primary detectors. Um, so, um, I kinda see like, after after building the primary detectors I see um, myself taking the outputs and feeding them in, sorta tandem style into into a um, Gaussian mixtures HMM back - end, um, and doing recognition. Um. So, that's that's just generally what I 've been looking at.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad g: Um,\nprofessor c: By by the way, uh, the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at.\ngrad g: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: you know, um, if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as I think it is, it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced,\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: that one might be another thing.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Yeah. Yeah. Um, were were you gonna say something?\nphd f: Mmm.\ngrad g: Oh. It looked OK, never mind. Um, yeah. And so, this this past week um, I 've been uh, looking a little bit into uh, TRAPS um, and doing doing TRAPS on on these e events too, just, um, seeing seeing if that's possible. Uh, and um, other than that, uh, I was kicked out of I - house for living there for four years.\nprofessor c: Oh no. So you live in a cardboard box in the street now\ngrad g: Yeah.\nprofessor c: or, no?\ngrad g: Uh, well, s s som something like that.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad g: In Albany, yeah. Yeah. And uh. Yep.

Uh, yesterday I called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from May thirtieth and she said she's interviewing two more people. So. And she would get back to me on Monday. So that's that's only thing I have and Diane has a few more houses. She's going to take some pictures and send me after I go back. So it's that's \nprofessor c: OK.\nphd f: Oh.

So, in that case, I 'm going to be here on thirty - first definitely.\nprofessor c: until you OK.\ngrad e: You know, if you 're in a desperate situation and you need a place to stay, you could stay with me for a while. I 've got a spare bedroom right now.\nphd a: Oh. OK. Thanks. That sure is nice of you. So, it may be he needs more than me.\ngrad g: Oh r oh. Oh no, no. My my cardboard box is actually a nice spacious two bedroom apartment.\nprofessor c: So a two bedroom cardboard box. Th - that's great.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Thanks Dave.\ngrad g: yeah\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Um,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Do y wanna say anything about You you actually been Uh, last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre, you were you were mentioning. Is that that something worth talking about, or?\ngrad e: Um, it's Well, um, it I don't think it directly relates. Um, well, so, I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi and he's int He wanted to um, look at um, how people respond to formant changes, I think. Um. So he he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel - to - vowel transitions, and then he wanted a psycho - acoustic um, spectrum. And he wanted to look at um, how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum and compare that to the to the listener tests. And, um. So, I gave him a PLP spectrum. And to um he he t wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they 're moving. So I took the um, PLP LPC coefficients and um, I found the roots. This was something that Stephane suggested. I found the roots of the um, LPC polynomial to, um, track the peaks in the, um, PLP LPC spectra.\nphd a: well there is aligned spectral pairs, is like the the Is that the aligned s\nprofessor c: It's a r root LPC, uh, of some sort.\nphd a: Oh, no.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So you just \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: instead of the log you took the root square, I mean cubic root or something. What di w I didn't get that.\nprofessor c: No, no. It's it's it's taking the finding the roots of the LPC polynomial.\nphd a: Polynomial. Yeah. Is that the line spectral \nprofessor c: So it's like line spectral pairs.\nphd a: Oh, it's like line sp\nprofessor c: Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle, don't they,\nphd a: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: to sort of? But it But uh, you know. But what we 'd used to do w when I did synthesis at National Semiconductor twenty years ago, the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the LPC polynomial and and uh, finding the roots. It wasn't PLP cuz Hynek hadn't invented it yet, but it was just LPC, and uh, we found the roots of the polynomial, And th When you do that, sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants, sometimes they 're not.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: So it's it's it's a little,\nphd d: Hmm.\nprofessor c: uh Formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech,\nphd f: So you just You typically just get a few roots?\nprofessor c: but.\nphd f: You know, two or three,\nprofessor c: Well you get these complex pairs.\nphd f: something like that?\nprofessor c: And it depends on the order that you 're doing, but.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Right. So, um, if @ @ Every root that's Since it's a real signal, the LPC polynomial's gonna have real coefficients. So I think that means that every root that is not a real root is gonna be a c complex pair,\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: um, of a complex value and its conjugate. Um. So for each And if you look at that on the unit circle, um, one of these one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency, one will be a negative frequency, I think. So I just So, um, f for the I 'm using an eighth - order polynomial and I 'll get three or four of these pairs\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: Hmm.\ngrad e: which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions.\nprofessor c: This is from synthetic speech, or?\ngrad e: It's Right. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah. So if it's from synthetic speech then maybe it 'll be cleaner. I mean for real speech in real then what you end up having is, like I say, funny little things that are don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well.\nphd f: How did \nprofessor c: But but mostly they are.\nphd d: But\nprofessor c: Mostly they do.\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad e: Mmm,\nprofessor c: And and what I mean in in what we were doing, which was not so much looking at things, it was OK\nphd d: I \nprofessor c: because it was just a question of quantization. Uh, we were just you know, storing It was We were doing, uh, stored speech, uh, quantization.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But but uh, in your case um, you know \nphd d: Actually you have peaks that are not at the formant's positions, but they are lower in energy\ngrad e: But there's some of that, yes.\nphd d: and Well they are much lower.\nphd f: If this is synthetic speech can't you just get the formants directly? I mean h how is the speech created?\ngrad e: It was created from a synthesizer, and um \nphd f: Wasn't a formant synthesizer was it?\nprofessor c: I bet it it might have may have been\ngrad e: I d d this \nprofessor c: but maybe he didn't have control over it or something?\ngrad e: In in fact w we we could get, um, formant frequencies out of the synthesizer, as well. And, um, w one thing that the, um, LPC approach will hopefully give me in addition, um, is that I I might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well. Um, Stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a like a se second - order IIR filter.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: Um, but I don't think there's a g a really good reason not to um, get the formant frequencies from the synthesizer instead. Except that you don't have the psycho - acoustic modeling in that.\nprofessor c: Yeah, so the actual So you 're not getting the actual formants per se. You 're getting the Again, you 're getting sort of the, uh \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: You 're getting something that is is uh, af strongly affected by the PLP model. And so it's more psycho - acoustic. So it's a little It's It's It's sort of sort of a different thing.\nphd f: Oh, I see. That's sort of the point.\nprofessor c: But Yeah. i Ordinarily, in a formant synthesizer, the bandwidths as well as the ban uh, formant centers are \nphd f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: I mean, that's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in, as as what you \ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But but yeah, you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section, which has, uh, band center and band width, and um, um But. Yeah. O K. So, uh, yeah, you 're going back today and then back in a week I guess,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and. Yeah. Great! Well, welcome.\nphd a: Thanks.\nphd f: I guess we should do digits quickly.\nprofessor c: Oh yeah, digits.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor c: I almost forgot that.\nphd b: Digits.\nprofessor c: I almost forgot our daily digits.\nphd f: You wanna go ahead?\nprofessor c: Sure.\nphd f: OK.", "en_query": "Summarize the meeting", "zh_query": "总结会议", "fr_query": "Résumer la réunion", "ukr_query": "Підведіть підсумки зустрічі", "en_summary": "The meeting covered the issues with different kinds of mics, progress on the Aurora project, effectiveness of spectral subtraction, adding parameter to spectral coefficient, and studying energy in the data, along with a short discussion on student housing.

{"fname": "academic_test_3", "dialogue": "phd f: We um So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines, uh, to use as sort of a compute farm. And um, uh, we ordered uh, SUN - Blade - one - hundreds, and um, I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in, but, uh, in addition, we 're running So the plan for using these is, uh, we 're running P - make and Customs here and Andreas has sort of gotten that all uh, fixed up and up to speed. And he's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um, run things using P - make and Customs. You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that. The simplest thing And I can send an email around or, maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something. Um,\nprofessor c: How about an email that points to the FAQ,\nphd f: there's a c\nprofessor c: you know what I 'm saying?\nphd f: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: so that you can Yeah.\nphd f: Uh, there's a command, uh, that you can use called \" run command \". \" Run dash command \", \" run hyphen command \". And, if you say that and then some job that you want to execute, uh, it will find the fastest currently available machine, and export your job to that machine, and uh and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment. So you can try this as a simple test with uh, the L S command. So you can say \" run dash command L S \", and, um, it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute, and um, do an LS on your current directory. So, substitute LS for whatever command you want to run, and um And that's a simple way to get started using using this. And, so, soon, when we get all the new machines up, um, e then we 'll have lots more compute to use. Now th one of the nice things is that uh, each machine that's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it. Uh, attributes like how much memory the machine has, what its speed is, what its operating system, and when you use something like \" run command \", you can specify those attributes for your program. For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux, you can give it the Linux attribute, and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that. So. You can control where your jobs go, to a certain extent, all the way down to an individual machine. Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself. So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that. If there's already a job running, on some machine that you 're trying to select, your job will get queued up, and then when that resource, that machine becomes available, your job will get exported there. So, there's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh, right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're Uh. The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it.\nprofessor c: So as I understand, you know, he's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines,\nphd f: So.\nprofessor c: is the rough division of \nphd f: Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, you know, I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently and uh, uh I fired off a training job, and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying, \" uh, are you running two trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run. \" So I had to back off a little bit. But, soon as we get some more machines then uh then we 'll have more compute available. So, um, that's just a quick update about what we 've got. So.\ngrad g: Um, I have I have a question about the uh, parallelization?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: So, um, let's say I have like, a thousand little little jobs to do?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Um, how do I do it with \" run command \"? I mean do \nphd f: You could write a script uh, which called run command on each sub - job\ngrad g: Uh - huh. A thousand times?\nphd f: right? But you probably wanna be careful with that\ngrad g: OK.\nphd f: because um, you don't wanna saturate the network. Uh, so, um, you know, you should you should probably not run more than, say ten jobs yourself at any one time, uh, just because then it would keep other people \ngrad g: Oh, too much file transfer and stuff.\nphd f: Well it's not that so much as that, you know, e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and, you know, people's jobs would get delayed, so it's sort of a sharing thing. Um,\ngrad g: OK.\nphd f: so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time. Um. So if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run, um, you 'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were gonna use \" run command \", uh, to only have ten of those going at a time. And uh, then, when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one. Um,\nprofessor c: I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop, I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out.\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine.\nphd f: Yeah. Yep. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you have to be a little bit careful.\nprofessor c: as I recall, but. Yeah.\nphd d: Hmm.\nphd f: Um, but uh, you can also If you have that level of parallelization um, and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that, you can use um, P - make\ngrad g: Just do P - make.\nphd f: and and you basically write a Make file that uh, you know your final job depends on these one thousand things,\ngrad g: s Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and when you run P - make, uh, on your Make file, you can give it the dash capital J and and then a number,\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and that number represents how many uh, machines to use at once. And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd f: So,\ngrad g: Right. OK.\nphd f: I can get some documentation.\nphd d: So it it's it's not systematically queued.

Yeah.\nprofessor c: How is it I I guess I 'm ignorant about this, how does I mean, since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals, how is how is that differ from signal subspace?\nphd a: The signal subspace? The \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: The signal subspace approach has actually an in - built Wiener filtering in it.\nprofessor c: Oh, OK.\nphd a: Yeah. It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter. Is the signal is is a signal substrate.\nprofessor c: Oh, oh, OK so the difference is the KL.\nphd a: So, the the different the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad. It's it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions, and in colored noise.\nprofessor c: I see. So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction, followed by a KL transform, followed by a\nphd a: Wiener filtering. It's a it's a cascade of two s\nprofessor c: Wiener filter. Yeah, in general, you don't that's right you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy. Actually. Um, that was something that uh, Herve and I were talking about with um, the multi - band stuff, that if you 're converting things to from uh, bands, groups of bands into cepstral coef you know, local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it's not that great to do it if it's noisy.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. OK. Yeah. So.\nprofessor c: Uh, so.\nphd a: So that that's one reason maybe we could combine s some something to improve SNR a little bit, first stage,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further.\nphd d: What was your point about about colored noise there?\nphd a: Oh, the colored noise uh \nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has I mean, it it actually depends on inverting the matrices. So it it ac the covariance matrix of the noise. So if if it is not positive definite,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I mean it has a it's It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite ak It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite.\nprofessor c: So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise.\nphd a: So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering, first of the colo colored noise\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then make the noise white,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back, you do this filtering again.\nphd d: Yeah, right.\nprofessor c: I was only half kidding. I mean if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction, that also gets rid \nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and then you then then add a little bit l noise noise addition I mean, that sort of what J JRASTA does, in a way.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise,\nphd a: Huh? Uh - huh.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: in order to get rid of the effects of noise.\nphd a: So.\nprofessor c: OK.\nphd d: Yeah. Uh, yeah. So there is this. And maybe we well we find some people so that uh, agree to maybe work with us, and they have implementation of VTS techniques so it's um, Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm, uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra.

And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to \" Session \", and write MR eleven.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah. We didn't have a front - end meeting today.\ngrad c: And let's remember also to make sure that one's gets marked as unread, unused.\nprofessor e: OK.\nphd a: MR eleven.\ngrad c: MR eleven.\npostdoc f: That sounds like a spy code.\nprofessor e: Mmm. OK. So.\ngrad c: There's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work correctly.\nprofessor e: Agenda. Any agenda items today?\ngrad c: I wanna talk a little bit about getting how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps, parts of the meeting that they don't want to include. What I 've done so far, and I wanna get some opinions on, how to how to finish it up.\nprofessor e: OK.\npostdoc f: I wanna ask about um, some aud audio monitoring on some of the um well some of the equipment. In particular, the well uh, that's just what I wanna ask.\nprofessor e: OK audio monitoring, Jane.\npostdoc f: Ba - based on some of the tran uh i In listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things, and in pact in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings,\ngrad c: Oh really.\npostdoc f: so I \nphd b: \" Spikes \", you mean like uh, instantaneous click type spikes, or?\npostdoc f: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nphd a: Spikes?\ngrad c: Clicks.\npostdoc f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Hmm.\npostdoc f: Yeah.\nphd b: Huh.\npostdoc f: And I don't know what the e electronics is but.\ngrad c: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yeah.\ngrad c: Well, I think it's\nphd a: Touching.\ngrad c: uh, it it could be a number of things.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad c: It could be touching and fiddling, and the other thing is that it could the fact that it's on a wired mike is suspicious. It might be a connector.\npostdoc f: Oh, OK. Well maybe Then we don't really have to talk about that as an \nphd b: You could try an experiment and say \" OK, I 'm about to test for spikes \",\npostdoc f: I I take that off the agenda.\nphd b: and then wiggle the thing there, and then go and when they go to transcribe it, it could, ask them to come and get you.\ngrad c: Yeah. Right.\nphd b: \" Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there's spikes. \"\npostdoc f: Oh that \nprofessor e: Um.\npostdoc f: Well, OK.\nphd b: No I 'm just \nprofessor e: I mean, were this a professional audio recording, what we would do  what you would do is in testing it is, you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance. And if they are, then they can't be used.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: So. Um. Let's see. I guess I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh, recording, transcription you know, basically you know where we are on the corpus.\npostdoc f: Good.\nprofessor e: And then um, the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest, I think, deal is, uh, agendas. So maybe I 'll I 'll start with that actually. Uh, um. Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know, if possible, what we were gonna be talking about because he's sort of peripherally involved to this point, and if there's gonna be a topic about discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he's trying to help us out, in the because of uh the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so, he figures he could help that out by not showing \ngrad c: Mmm.\nprofessor e: and and I 'm sure help out his own time. by not showing up if it's a meeting that he's he's So, uh in order I 'd I think that this is a wish on his part. Uh. It's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and and \ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: But um, we could try anyway, uh, do another try at coming up with the agenda uh, at some point before the meeting, uh, say the day before.\ngrad c: Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on Wednesday, or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: OK. You you wanna volunteer to do that?\ngrad c: Sure.\nprofessor e: OK. Alright so we 'll send out agenda request.\ngrad c: Let me\nprofessor e: Uh.\nphd b: That 'll be I think that 'll help \ngrad c: I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done.\nphd b: That 'll help a lot, actually.\nprofessor e: Yeah, I have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have, Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting. And uh, she ends up getting the agenda requests uh, uh ten minutes before the meeting. But but  But. Uh. But we can try. Maybe it 'll work.\nphd b: Mmm.\ngrad c: Yeah. Maybe. Weirder things have happened.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: I 'm wondering if he were to just, uh, specify particular topics, I mean. Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more.\nphd b: I would I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him.\ngrad c: Well then \nprofessor e: Yeah. Actually it This this maybe brings up another topic which is um So we 're done with that topic. The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels, and all that.\ngrad c: Yeah, actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Why why don't we do that.\ngrad c: OK. Um, the new microphones, the two new ones are in. Um. And they are being assembled as we speak, I hope. And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow. Um, and then the other question I was thinking about is well, a couple things. First of all, if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable, we should probably just go ahead and get them. So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in,\nphd a: \ngrad c: and get people's opinions on on what they think of them. Um, then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless. Another wireless setup. I mean it's expensive, but it does seem to be better than the wired.\nprofessor e: So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup?\ngrad c: Um, well, I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless. So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike, possibility of six wireless receivers, and apparently you can chain those together. And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes.\nprofessor e: So, um.\ngrad c: And So, you know it's still, it's fifteen minus six.\nprofessor e: So let's see we \ngrad c: Right? So we could have up to nine.\nprofessor e: And right now we can have up to six.\ngrad c: Right. And we have five, we 're getting one more.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: And it's um, about nine hundred dollars for the base station, and then eight hundred per channel.\nprofessor e: Oh. So yeah so the only Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that's nine hundred dollars.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: Oh, we should do it.\ngrad c: OK. OK, so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd b: I don't quite understand how that how that works,. If So we 're not increasing the number of channels. OK.\ngrad c: No, we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working,\nphd b: OK. I see.\ngrad c: along with a couple of the wired that aren't working, one of the wired that's not working, with a wireless.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd b: Three wireds work,\nprofessor e: Basically we found \nphd b: right?\ngrad c: I I guess three wireds work, yeah.\nphd b: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah. But we 've had more problems with that.\ngrad c: Yep.\nprofessor e: And that sort of bypasses the whole the whole Jimbox thing and all that.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: And so um, we we seem to have uh, a reliable way of getting the data in, which is through the ra Sony radio mikes, as long as we 're conscious about the batteries.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: That seems to be the key issue.\ngrad c: Everyone's battery OK?\nphd b: I checked them this morning, they should be.\ngrad c: OK.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Um, That's the only thing with them. But the quality seems really good and Um I heard from UW that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their, uh setup purchased. They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf.\ngrad c: Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff, and so, you know, what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd b: SRI, really?\ngrad c: Yeah.\nphd b: Oh.\ngrad c: They got sa apparent Well, Maybe this needs to be bleeped out? I have no clue.\nprofessor e: Uh, I don't know.\ngrad c: I don't know how much of it's public.\nprofessor e: Probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: Yeah. But anyway there's there's there's uh, uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and NIST and UW. So. Um. But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony,\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: uh, radio - mikes. Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector, which means some hand - soldering or something, right?\ngrad c: Uh, no, we 're having the them do it.\nprofessor e: No?\ngrad c: So it's so hand - soldering it, but I 'm not doing it.\nprofessor e: Oh.\ngrad c: So, they they charge\nprofessor e: OK. Nothing against you and your hand - soldering\ngrad c: right.\nprofessor e: but \ngrad c: You 've never seen my hand - soldering. But uh, a as I said they 're coming in.\nprofessor e: Uh, OK, so that's being done professionally and \ngrad c: I I mean \nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: Yeah. I mean.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: As professionally as I guess you can get it done.\nprofessor e: Well, it could if they do a lot of it, it's \ngrad c: I mean i it's just their repair shop. Right? Their maintenance people.\nprofessor e: Well, we 'll see what it it's like.\ngrad c: Yep.\nprofessor e: That tha that can be quite good. Th - this Yeah, OK. Good. Yeah. So let's go with that.\ngrad c: And, I mean we 'll see, tomorrow, you know, what it looks like.\nprofessor e: Uh, Yeah. So, um, uh, Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits. Uh, so he 'll be interested in what's going on with that. I guess Was the decision last time was that the the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well? Has that started, or is that?\npostdoc f: Mm - hmm. Yeah. Uh, it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that.\ngrad c: Right, so, the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork. So I did the all that last week. So all the all the forms are now on the computer. And uh, then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh transcribers use different tools. And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those.\npostdoc f: Mm - hmm. So he has a nice set up that they it w it will be efficient for them to do that.\nprofessor e: OK.\ngrad c: I I don't think it 'll take too long.\nprofessor e: So anyway \ngrad c: So, you know, just uh, a matter of a few days I suspect.\nprofessor e: So anyway I think we we have at least one uh, user for the digits once they get done, which will be Dave.\ngrad c: Right. I 've already done five or six sets.\npostdoc f: OK.\ngrad c: So if he wanted to, you know, just have a few to start with, he could. You know, and I also have a bunch of scripts that will, like, generate P - files and run recognition on them also.\nprofessor e: Yeah, he might he might be asking Right. OK. Uh, is Dave I don't know if Dave is on the list, if he's invited to these meetings, uh if he knows.\npostdoc f: I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even.\nphd a: No, no.\ngrad c: Uh, we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he's on the list.\npostdoc f: Yeah. Should we call him? I mean is he d is he definitely not available today?\nprofessor e: I don't know.\npostdoc f: Should I call his office and see?\nphd a: He was in.\ngrad c: I mean, he's still taking classes, so uh, he may well have conflicts.\nprofessor e: Uh, well i it's uh \nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah, he was in s\npostdoc f: He wasn't there at cof\nprofessor e: Yeah, so this might be a conflict for him.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: OK.\nprofessor e: OK. Uh, so.\ngrad c: Yeah didn't he say his signal - processing class was like Tuesdays and Thursdays?\nphd a: I think he has a class. Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah. He might have.\ngrad c: Oh well, whatever.\ngrad d: You talking about David Gelbart?\nprofessor e: Oh, OK.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yes.\ngrad d: Yeah, I think he's taking two twenty - five A which is now.\nphd b: Yeah.\ngrad d: So.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: OK.\nprofessor e: OK. So, that's why we 're not seeing him. OK. Uh, transcriptions, uh, beyond the digits, where we are, and so on.\npostdoc f: OK.\nprofessor e: And the and the recordings also,\npostdoc f: Um \nprofessor e: just where we are. Yeah.\npostdoc f: Well, so um, should we we don't wan wanna do the recording status first, or?\ngrad c: Well, we have about thirty - two hours uh as of, I guess a week and a half ago, so we probably now have about thirty - five hours.\nprofessor e: And and that's that's uh How much of that is digits? It's uh that's including digits,\ngrad c: That's including digits.\nprofessor e: right?\ngrad c: I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits.\nprofessor e: So Yeah. So anyway there's at least probably thirty hours, or something of There's got to be more than thirty hour \nphd a: Mmm.\ngrad c: Of of non - digits?\nprofessor e: i it couldn't of Of non - digits.\ngrad c: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the digits don't take up that much time.\nprofessor e: Yeah, yeah. OK.\npostdoc f: OK, and the transcribers h I, uh, don't have the exact numbers, but I think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh, transcribing from them right now. The next step is to that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first, and then channelized. What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked, that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout, and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh, Liz requested in terms of um, um in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers, and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about. Um, for example, i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \". And you know, so how you could \ngrad c: Nine two,\npostdoc f: e Exactly.\ngrad c: right.\npostdoc f: So if you just say \" nine two \", the there are many s ways that could have been expressed. An - and I just had them I I mean, a certain number of them did put the words down, but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by, um, a gloss th and things.\nphd b: You know, Jane?\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Um, one suggestion and you may already be doing this, but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things, if you um, just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them, a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis\ngrad c: Misspelled.\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc f: You 're talking about the type token frequency listings, and I use those too. Y you mean just uh on each on each line there's a one word right? It's one token from the from the corpus.\nphd b: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: Yeah, those are e extremely efficient and I and I I agree that's a very good use of it.\nphd b: Oh so you already have that, OK.\npostdoc f: Well that's that's a way that's You know, the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes, that's that's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon.\nphd b: Mm - hmm. Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other, and uh,\npostdoc f: Exactly. And then you ca then you can do a s\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: i in alphabetized lists, they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier.\npostdoc f: Absolutely. I agree. That's a very good that's a very good uh, suggestion. And that was that's my strategy for handling a lot of these things, in terms of things that need to be glossed. I didn't get to that point but So there are numbers, then there are acronyms, and then um, there's a he she wants the uh, actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is, so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized, like cough or like laugh or whatever, \" NONVOC \" for door - slam, and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error.\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: I already had that convention\nphd b: Oh that's great.\npostdoc f: but I I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter. That was what I was always planing on. So that, you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying, you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \",\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: then y you know it's it's You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter, than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space,\nphd b: Yeah.\npostdoc f: so man So many ways that error prone.\nphd b: Right. Right.\npostdoc f: So, um, um I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter, into these tagged uh, subcategorized comments, and same thing with you know, we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying,\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: you end up with a s with uh, you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: and you can um, have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes. But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand, because, you know I mean, jus\ngrad c: You don't know what they could be.\nphd b: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yeah now TIMIT's clear um and PLP is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known, in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say \" nine two \" or you can say \" ninety - two \",\ngrad c: So how are you doing the \npostdoc f: and uh I 'd handle the numbers individually.\ngrad c: How are you doing the uh, acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript?\npostdoc f: It would be separate The letters would be separated in space\ngrad c: OK.\npostdoc f: and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that's necessary, clarifying what it is,\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: so gloss of whatever.\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: I don't know if that's really necessary to do that. Maybe it's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh, a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there, and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it's uh the you know, uh enumerated, or i\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: it's not a good way of saying but it's it's the specific uh way of stating these these letters.\ngrad c: Right. So it sounds good.\npostdoc f: And so anyway, the clean those are those things and then channelized is to then um, get it into this multichannel format. And at that point then it's ready for use by Liz and Don. But that's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized, the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: And uh, Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um, up and running and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean, and channelized.\nphd a: I actually gave\ngrad c: Have you also been doing spot checks, Jane?\npostdoc f: Oh yes.\ngrad c: Okay, good.\npostdoc f: Well you see that's part of the cleaning process. I spent um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers,\ngrad c: Oh good. Good.\npostdoc f: and I went through it last night, it's it's almost spooky how similar these are, word for word. And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I I left them discretion at commas.\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: Uh and so because it's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: And um, and so they 'll be a difference in commas, but it's word - by - word the same, in in huge patches of the data. And I have t ten minute stretch where I can where I can show that. And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon, and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech. So um, the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up \" gobbledy - gook \".\nphd b: Hmm.\npostdoc f: And the other one didn't. And on this side, this one's picking up things like \" neural nets \" and the one that's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't.\ngrad c: Right.\nphd b: When for the person who missed \" gobbledy - gook \" what did they put?\npostdoc f: It was an interesting approximation, put in parentheses, cuz I have this convention that, i if they 're not sure what it was, they put it in parentheses.\nphd b: Oh.\npostdoc f: So they tried to approximate it, but it was \nphd b: Oh good.\npostdoc f: it was spelled GABBL \nphd b: Sort of how it sounds. Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yes. More of an attempt to I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds,\ngrad c: It was a technical term that she didn't recognize,\nphd b: Yeah.\npostdoc f: but Yeah. But she knew that she didn't know it. Maybe it was a technical ter exactly. But she even though her technical perception is just really uh you know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she's taken any courses in this area or if she's taken cognitive science courses\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: then cuz \" neural nets \" and oh she has some things that are oh \" downsampled \", she got that right.\nphd b: Hmm.\npostdoc f: And some of these are rather uh unexpected.\ngrad c: Obscure, yeah.\npostdoc f: But ch ten solid uh m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data.\nprofessor e: And and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours?\npostdoc f: And um \nprofessor e: Is that right?\npostdoc f: Yes exactly.\nprofessor e: Yeah, OK.\npostdoc f: And that's part of this Eleven hours.\nprofessor e: Is that is that that including digits? Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yes it is.\nprofessor e: So let's say roughly ten hours or so of \npostdoc f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: I mean it's probably more than that but but with of of non - digits.\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc f: It 'd be more than that because I my recollection is the minutes that da digits don't take more than half a minute. Per person.\nprofessor e: Oh, OK.\npostdoc f: But um the the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape,\nprofessor e: Oh, I see.\npostdoc f: But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet.\nprofessor e: Oh, I see.\npostdoc f: So they 're still working some of them are Two of them are still working on completing that. Yeah.\nphd b: Boy, they 're moving right along.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yeah. They are. Mm - hmm. They 're very efficient. There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: So what what what's the deal with with your \nphd a: The channel u thing?\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd a: Oh, it's just uh, I ran the recognizer uh, the  speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and, it's just in uh in this new multi - channel format and output, and I just gave one one meeting to to Liz who wanted to to try it for for the recognizer\nprofessor e: Oh, I see.\nphd a: as uh, apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech, which took too much memory or whatever,\nprofessor e: Right.\nphd a: and so she she will try that I think\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd a: and I 'm I 'm working on it. So, I hope \ngrad c: Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before?\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd a: No. Uh, I mmm, use some some different features but not not \ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: The basic thing is this HMM base.\ngrad c: So there's still no no knowledge using different channels at the same time.\nphd a: There is some, uh as the energy is normalized across channels\ngrad c: You know what I mean? Across all of them.\nphd a: yeah.\ngrad c: OK.\nphd a: So. But basically that's one of the main changes.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm. What are some of the other features? Besides the energy? You said you 're trying some different features, or something.\nphd a: Oh I just uh Mmm, I just use um our loudness - based things now as they before there were they were some in in the log domain and I I changed this to the to the \nprofessor e: Cu - Cube root?\nphd a: Yeah. To No, I changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the\ngrad c: Hmm.\nprofessor e: Ah.\nphd a: how do you call it? I 'm not sure. With the, uh \nprofessor e: Fletcher Munson? No.\nphd a: I 'm not sure about the term.\nprofessor e: Oh, OK.\nphd a: Uh, I 'll look it up. And say it to you.\nprofessor e: Yeah, alright.\nphd a: Uh, OK, and Yeah. That's that's basically the the the thing. Yeah, and I and I tried t to normalize uh uh the features, there's loudness and modified loudness, um, within one channel,\nprofessor e: OK.\nphd a: because they 're, yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech. And it works quite well. But, not always.\nprofessor e: Uh - huh. Uh - huh.\nphd a: So.\nprofessor e: OK.\ngrad c: Good.\nprofessor e: Um, let's see. I think the uh Were were you basically done with the transcription part? So I guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing.\ngrad c: Right. So the The idea is that we need to have We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want. So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages, uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them, and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded. And then, it's a form, HTML form, so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded. And so, uh, some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue. And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password,\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: a single password. Each person will have a single password, user name and password. And then each meeting, we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it. And that way each person only has to remember one password.\nprofessor e: I I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed. I mean if people have Uh, I mean, for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it. And then um if I thought it was OK, I 'd say \" it's OK \".\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: And, I uh I mean it depends how this really ends up working out, but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare.\ngrad c: Right, I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for other reasons.\nprofessor e: OK.\ngrad c: And so that that's a minor part of it, I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text. So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready, um I would take them, and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted, and just uh, tell them, \" here's the web page \", um, \" you need a password \". So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords, and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it.\nprofessor e: That's I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say \" here is a here is \" I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper, that said, uh, \" here's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you? and if it is, here's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it's OK \".\ngrad c: I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide.\nprofessor e: And then they 'd hand it back to you.\ngrad c: But certainly I wouldn't want a printout. These are big, and I would much rather be ha be able to just sit and leaf through it.\nprofessor e: You find it easier to go through a large I mean how do you read books?\ngrad c: Well I certainly read books by hand. But for something like this, I think it's easier to do it on the web.\nprofessor e: Really? I mean, it \ngrad c: Cuz you 're gonna get, you know, if I I 'm I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these. I wanna just be able to go to go to the web site and visit it as I want.\nprofessor e: Going to a web site is easy, but flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web.\ngrad c: Well, I don't think it's that much harder than, paper. So.\nprofessor e: Really?\npostdoc f: I have one question. So are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript? Because I I do think that there's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the \nprofessor e: So here's the way I was imagining it, and maybe I 'm wrong,\npostdoc f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: but the way I imagined it was that um, the largest set of people is gonna go \" oh yeah, I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead, where's the where's the release? \" And then there 'll be a subset of people, right? OK there's I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: OK there 'll be a subset of people, who um, will say uh \" well, yeah, I really would like to see that. \" And for them, the easiest way to flip through, if it's a really large document, I mean unless you 're searching. Searching, of course, should be electronic, but if you 're not so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing. Um if if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really, really long document, I mean whenever I 've had a really, really long document that it was sitting on the web, I 've always ended up printing it out. I mean, so it's it's I mean, you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time, you wanna figure you have a train ride, and there's all these situations where where I I mean, this is how I was imagining it, anyway. And then I figured, that out of that group, there would be a subset who would go \" hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here, \" and then that group would need it S It seems like i if I 'm right in that, it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case, rather than for the most frequent case. So that uh, now we have to worry about privacy,\ngrad c: Well, no fre for the most \nprofessor e: we have to worry about all these passwords, for different people\ngrad c: For the most frequent case they just say \" it's OK \" and then they 're done. And I think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: The other thing too is it seems like \nprofessor e: Um, yeah, that's true.\npostdoc f: Go ahead.\ngrad c: I mean, cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: I guess Yeah, I guess we don't need their signature. I guess an email OK is alright.\ngrad c: Oh that was another thing I I had assumed that we didn't need their signature, that it that an email approval was sufficient. But I don't actually know.\nphd b: Are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking?\ngrad c: Yes. If someone feels strongly enough about it, then I I I think they should be allowed to do that.\npostdoc f: I also mm - hmm.\nphd b: So that means other people are editing what you say?\nprofessor e: Uh I don't know about that.\ngrad c: Yeah.\nphd b: I don't know if I like that.\ngrad c: Well, the only other choice is that the person would say \" no, don't distribute this meeting at all \", and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it at all \".\nprofessor e: But th what they signed in the consent form, was something that said you can use my voice.\ngrad c: Well, but if if someone is having a conversation, and you only bleep out one side of it, that's not sufficient.\nprofessor e: Right? Yeah. Yeah, but that's our decision then. Right?\ngrad c: Um, I don't think so. I mean, because if I object to the conversation.\nprofessor e: I think it is.\ngrad c: If I say \" we were having a conversation, and I consider that conversation private, \" and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer, I wanna be able to bleep out your side.\npostdoc f: The I agree that the consent forms were uh, I cons agree with what Adam's saying, that um, the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them.\nprofessor e: I see. OK, well, if that's what it said.\npostdoc f: And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer, but it strikes me that uh, we wouldn't want someone to say \" oh yes, I was a little concerned about it but it was too hard to access \". So I think it's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it. Now in terms of like editing it by hand, I mean I think it's i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited. But but it seems to me that sometimes um, you know i if a person had a bad day, and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like, you know it's nice it's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK.\ngrad c: I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it. Um.\nprofessor e: Um I mean it's also a mixture of people, I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer, flipping around the web, and others do not.\ngrad c: Yep.\nprofessor e: Others would consider it this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain. You know?\ngrad c: Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former.\nprofessor e: It depends on what meetings.\npostdoc f: That's true.\nphd b: So far.\ngrad c: So.\nprofessor e: In the meetings so far, yeah.\ngrad c: Yep.\nprofessor e: But we 're trying to expand this, right?\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: So I I I actually think that paper is the more universal thing.\ngrad c: And that Well, but if they want to print it out that's alright.\npostdoc f: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\ngrad c: I think everyone in the meeting can access the web.\nprofessor e: No, I think we have to be able to print it out. It's not just if they want to print it out. I I think \ngrad c: OK, so does that mean that I can't use email? Or what?\npostdoc f: Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking.\nprofessor e: I I th\ngrad c: Well, I don't think I \nprofessor e: well we there was this \ngrad c: well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues.\nprofessor e: No.\npostdoc f: Good. For security?\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yeah, OK good.\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad c: Um. So giving them, you think a web site to say, \" if you wanna print it out here it is \", is not sufficient?\npostdoc f: Good point. \nphd a: Yeah. I\nprofessor e: Certainly for everybody who's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient.\ngrad c: Yeah, I 'm just thinking for people that that's not sufficient for, what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them.\nprofessor e: I 'm just wondering about \npostdoc f: You could mail it to them.\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Get an a mailing address.\ngrad c: Equivalent.\nphd a: But \npostdoc f: But I think it's easier to drop in the box.\nphd a: Just put the button on on the web page which say \" please send me the the scripts \".\ngrad c: That's right.\npostdoc f: Oh that's interesting.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: What um When you display it on the web page, what are what are you showing them? Utterances, or?\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And so can they bleep within an utterance?\ngrad c: No. Whole utterances only.\nphd b: Whole utterances.\ngrad c: And that was just convenience for my sake, that it's uh, uh it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level. Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand.\nprofessor e: There's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me. Um, I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this.\nphd b: Mmm.\ngrad c: I mean that's why I did the web form, because for me that would be my most convenient.\nprofessor e: I I I understand.\nphd b: I know where you 're going.\nprofessor e: I think that's the bad idea.\ngrad c: Oh.\nprofessor e: See because you 're gon you 're uh Really. You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things, whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go. Because nob you know it There was a one or twi once or twice, in the re in the meetings we 've heard, where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by, but overall people are talking about technical topics. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Nobody's being l libeled. You know, this is this we 're we 're covering We 're playing the lawyer's game, and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case. If we really orient it towards that extreme case, make it really easy, we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache. That I think that's I 'm sort of psyching myself out here, I I 'm trying to uh \ngrad c: I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache, bleeped out.\nprofessor e: but I I think that's Well, it's \ngrad c: So.\nphd b: I think what Morgan's saying is the easier it is, the more is gonna be bleeped.\nprofessor e: but i And and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing. I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of stuff in there that's missing from the dialogue.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: You know, it depends on the kind of research they 're doing,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: but it might be, uh it might be really a a pain. And, you know where it's really gonna hurt somebody, in some way the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about, we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out. But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence. And and uh, I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do, and so much fun! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff.\npostdoc f: So much fun.\nprofessor e: and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too, right from somebody else, as you say, you know, so \" well I didn't like what he said. \"\ngrad c: Well I don't see any way of avoiding that. I mean, we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like. So that the \nprofessor e: Yeah. No, no, I I I don't \ngrad c: The only question is \nprofessor e: You - you 've talked me into that, but I I just think that we should make it harder to do.\ngrad c: The problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me. Whereas this web interface, I just get email, it's all formatted, it's all ready to go and I can just insert it.\nprofessor e: So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it. So so so\npostdoc f: Well I guess Yeah.\nprofessor e: I 'm sorry so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it.\npostdoc f: Hmm.\nprofessor e: You 've provided something that's useful for you to do handle, and useful for someone else if they need it. But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh, they get access to this if they really need it.\ngrad c: Well \nphd b: So you 're saying the the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists, contacts them via whatever their preferred method is, to see if they want to review the meeting.\nprofessor e: Right.\nphd b: And then if they don't, you 're done. If they do, then he provides them access to the the web site.\ngrad c: Well, to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords.\nprofessor e: W w\nphd b: Or a printed - out form.\nprofessor e: There's there \ngrad c: So,\nprofessor e: y but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying.\ngrad c: Well, but \nprofessor e: So \nphd b: Only if they want it.\ngrad c: what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that's not secure. So they have to call me and ask.\nprofessor e: No, no, no. But you aren't necessarily giving them Right. But we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all.\nphd a: \ngrad c: Well, we do because of privacy. We can't just make it openly available on the web.\nprofessor e: No, no. You 're missing the point.\npostdoc f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: We 're We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log, to do this.\npostdoc f: Not everyone gets a password, unless they ask for it.\nprofessor e: Right? So th so what I would see, is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the \npostdoc f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: not just for fun, OK? but to to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it, at from their memory. Um and, uh, and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that's worded, OK? Then, if someone uh wants to review it, uh, and I know you don't like this, but I 'm offering this as a suggestion, is that is that we then give them a print out. And then if they say that \" I have a potential problem with these things, \" then, you you say \" OK well you might wanna hear this in context to s think if you need that, \" you issue them a password, i in the \ngrad c: But the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them, it's inconvenient for me. Because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything. I would much prefer to have all be automatic, they visit the web site if they want to. Obviously they don't have to.\nprofessor e: I know you 'd prefer it, but the proble\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: we have \ngrad c: So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that's gonna happen.\nprofessor e: there's a problem with it.\npostdoc f: I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing. Cuz I think if they feel that uh, it's I th I th You know, if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect, then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that, um, but but they might be able to argue \" oh well it was cumbersome, and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down \". So it could that the burden would come back onto us. So I 'm a little bit worried about uh, making it harder for them, from the legal standpoint.\nprofessor e: Well you can go too far in that direction, and you need to find somewhere between I think,\npostdoc f: Yeah.\ngrad c: It seems to me that sending them email, saying \" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK,\nprofessor e: because Uh - huh.\ngrad c: If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password \", seems like is a perfectly, reasonable compromise. And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves.\npostdoc f: Or we could print it up for them,\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc f: I mean we could offer that but but there's uh, another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form, um, my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript. And and I ha\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: I don't know that there's a chance of really skipping that stage. I mean I I thought that you were Maybe I misinterpreted what you said but it's \nprofessor e: Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean, that having it\ngrad c: Having it.\npostdoc f: Giving it to them.\ngrad c: Well the in \nprofessor e: right? It just means they have the right to have it.\npostdoc f: OK.\ngrad c: the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it,\npostdoc f: Alright. Fine. OK. Fair enough.\ngrad c: so.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: D you want me to grab one?\npostdoc f: Sh - sh well I could I 'm closer.\ngrad c: Yeah, but you 're wired\npostdoc f: I could \ngrad c: aren't you?\npostdoc f: Yeah. That is true.\nprofessor e: Um. Yeah, I mean I don't wanna fool them,\npostdoc f: I don't know \nprofessor e: I just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented,\npostdoc f: Oh yeah yeah oh I know.\nprofessor e: right?\ngrad c: \" If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised, which you would prefer not to have included in the data set. \"\nprofessor e: of and \npostdoc f: Yeah that's true. Yeah.\ngrad c: \" Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database, and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording. \"\npostdoc f: Hmm. Well that's more open than I realized.\ngrad c: Well, I mean it The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said.\nprofessor e: I \nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah, uh no that it tha\npostdoc f: Tha - that's true. That's more severe, but the next one says the transcript will be around.\nprofessor e: that's right.\npostdoc f: And it doesn't really say we 'll send it to you, or wi it 'll be available for you on the web, or anything.\nphd b: I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them.\nprofessor e: I I \npostdoc f: At least it more often. Yeah. It means also we don't have to g To give it to them. I mean like like Morgan was saying they they \ngrad c: They just have to make sure that it is available to them.\npostdoc f: It's available to them if they ask for it.\nprofessor e: Yeah, OK, so. wh um I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is, um, it's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded. So I I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very, I mean nothing hidden, v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: That that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out,\npostdoc f: Good.\nprofessor e: that it would be better for, um, our, uh, field if that is the case. But if you really think something is gonna And I don't think there's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias.\npostdoc f: Great. Great, great.\nprofessor e: And then then my concern about which \npostdoc f: Yeah. I agree.\nprofessor e: you know you might be right, it may be it was just paranoia on my part, uh but people just See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as just because they can.\ngrad c: It's just a check box next to the text, it's not any fun at all.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Well I don't know. I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out. You know.\ngrad c: Well, but they won't get that feedback.\nprofessor e: I\ngrad c: All no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time.\nprofessor e: Oh they won't?\ngrad c: It just sends me \nprofessor e: Oh good. So you haven't made it so much fun.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: Oh good.\ngrad c: It just sends me the time intervals.\nprofessor e: OK,\ngrad c: And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps. I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: because um, then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: So I I wanna I just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it.\nprofessor e: OK. Alright, so I think Yeah so if we have if i Again let's you know, sort of circulate the the wording on each of these things and get it right,\ngrad c: Well since you seem to feel heart uh, strongest about it, would you like to do the first pass?\nprofessor e: but but OK. Uh, fair enough. Turn about is fair play,\npostdoc f: Al - Also it ther there is this other question, the legal question that that Adam's raised, uh about whether we need a concrete signature, or email c i suffices or whatever\nprofessor e: Sorry.\ngrad c: Yeah.\npostdoc f: and I don't know how that works. i There's something down there about \" if you agree to \"\nprofessor e: I 'm I 'm I 'm I thought I I thought about it with one of my background processes\ngrad c: I don't think so.\nprofessor e: and I uh it's uh it's uh, it's fine to do the email.\npostdoc f: Ah. Fine.\ngrad c: Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says \" you 'll be given an opportunity. \"\nprofessor e: OK.\npostdoc f: Good. OK.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: And so I don't think they need another signature.\nprofessor e: And Well and furthermore I it's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that that uh if it's if it's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh \" OK I agree, we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount, and I agree that's OK, \" uh if it's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it's often done in email now\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: so it's it's OK.\npostdoc f: Great.\nprofessor e: Um.\ngrad c: So I guess I probably should at the minimum, think about how to present it in a printed form. I 'm not really sure what's best with that. The problem is a lot of them are really short,\npostdoc f: Well \ngrad c: and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line. But I don't know how else to do it.\npostdoc f: Well I s I also have this I I think it's nice you have it uh, viewab her hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about um, the non nonverbal side, I mean I I agree that our bias should be as as expressed here, and but I I think it's nice that a person could check. Cuz sometimes you know you the words on a on the page, come out soun sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it.\ngrad c: Hmm.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people you know, shouldn't borrow trouble. What it comes down to but \ngrad c: Yeah I think actually my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good. You know, if if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that.\npostdoc f: Oh, you know, or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh i segment a against some personal i th\ngrad c: Right. That was all mumbled?\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad c: I think Microsoft is\npostdoc f: Yeah exactly\nphd a: Oh,\ngrad c: Sorry transcribers.\npostdoc f: Or or even or even there was a a line you know about how \" hmm - mmm - mmm Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh. \"\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: but but it was all the words were all visible, but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript.\nphd a: Oh, God.\ngrad c: They 're gonna hate this meeting.\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yeah that's true.\ngrad c: Actually Liz will like it. You know, but.\nprofessor e: Liz will like it. We had a pretty strong disagreement going there.\ngrad c: Yep, yep, that's right.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yeah. So I don't know. I mean, I I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: But it the some something might sometime, and they uh if if it's something that they said, they might i i I mean, you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said,\npostdoc f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: but, when they hear it, themselves, they may hear something different because they know what they meant.\npostdoc f: I don't know how to notate that.\nphd b: Sarcasm,\npostdoc f: Yeah, that's right.\nphd b: how do you how do you indicate sarcasm?\npostdoc f: Yeah that's right.\nprofessor e: No, I 'm serious. So the so i the so we might we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was, you know, not not really what I said.\ngrad c: Yeah. Well that would be good to get, definitely.\nprofessor e: Yeah, but, Yeah, sure.\ngrad c: Just for corrections.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: So um, in terms of password distribution, I think phone is really the only way to do it, phone and in person. Or mail, physical mail.\npostdoc f: Yeah. Or if for leave it on their voice mail.\nphd b: Any sub - word level thing. \ngrad c: Any sub - wor Yeah, OK. I mean you could do it with PGP or things like that but it's too complex.\npostdoc f: You know I just realized something, which is of e th this question about the uh the possible mismatch of I mean i well, and actually also the lawyer saying that um, we shouldn't really have them have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks. You know?\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: I mean. So it's like i in a way it's it's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript, to have that be the \nprofessor e: Well yeah, but you can't dep I mean, most people will not wanna take the time to do that, though.\npostdoc f: Yeah, OK, fair enough. And they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves.\nprofessor e: And they they have to \npostdoc f: So it's not it's not um Yeah, good.\nprofessor e: But I mean if you were at a meeting, and and you you don't think, at least, that you said anything funny and the meeting was about, you know, some some funny thing about semantics or something, or uh \ngrad c: You probably won't listen to it.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: It is true that tec that the content is technical, I and so i and we 're not having these discussions which \nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc f: I I mean, when I listen to these things, I don't find things that are questionable, in other people's speech or in my own.\nprofessor e: Yeah. You would think it would be rare,\npostdoc f: Just It should be very rare.\nprofessor e: I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something, people have \npostdoc f: Yeah. Yeah, OK.\ngrad c: How about them energy crises.\nprofessor e: Yeah. I think we 're uh \ngrad c: Done?\nprofessor e: Kind of done. Actually, I was gonna Di - Did you have anything n that's going on, or \ngrad d: Not really. No. Um, my project is going along but um, I 'm really just here to um fill the project uh the overall progress. I don't really have anything specific to to talk about.\nprofessor e: Yeah. That's fine. I just didn't wanna go by you, if you had something.\ngrad d: Oh, OK.\nprofessor e: You don't have anything to say.\nphd b: No.\nprofessor e: Nah.\ngrad c: \nprofessor e: Transcribers, he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this this \ngrad c: Shall we do digits?\nprofessor e: Oh yeah.\ngrad c: Um, oh by the way I did find a bunch \ngrad d: It um\ngrad c: Uh, we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there?\nphd b: There were quite a few. Uh.\ngrad c: That's what I thought. I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them, that were blanks, that no one had actually read.\nphd b: Mmm.\ngrad c: And so we still have more than I thought we did.\nphd b: Oh good.\ngrad c: So, we have a few more digits before we 're done.\nphd b: You know having this headset reminds me of like working at Burger King or something.\ngrad c: Oops.\npostdoc f: Oh, did you do that?\nphd a: Burger King\ngrad c: I 'd like a burger with that,\nphd b: No I never did.\ngrad c: do you want fries with that?\nprofessor e: Wow.\nphd b: But I feel like I could now.\ngrad c: And ", "en_query": "What were the topics talked about in the meeting?", "zh_query": "会议的议题有哪些？", "fr_query": "Quels ont été les sujets abordés lors de la réunion ?", "ukr_query": "Про які теми йшлося на зустрічі?", "en_summary": "The group discussed recording equipment issues, including the purchase of two additional headsets and the prospect of getting a new base station and a set of wireless microphones to replace those wired microphones currently in use.

{"fname": "academic_test_9", "dialogue": "grad c: Well then \nprofessor e: Yeah. Actually it This this maybe brings up another topic which is um So we 're done with that topic. The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels, and all that.\ngrad c: Yeah, actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Why why don't we do that.\ngrad c: OK. Um, the new microphones, the two new ones are in. Um. And they are being assembled as we speak, I hope. And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow. Um, and then the other question I was thinking about is well, a couple things. First of all, if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable, we should probably just go ahead and get them. So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in,\nphd a: \ngrad c: and get people's opinions on on what they think of them. Um, then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless. Another wireless setup. I mean it's expensive, but it does seem to be better than the wired.\nprofessor e: So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup?\ngrad c: Um, well, I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless. So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike, possibility of six wireless receivers, and apparently you can chain those together. And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes.\nprofessor e: So, um.\ngrad c: And So, you know it's still, it's fifteen minus six.\nprofessor e: So let's see we \ngrad c: Right? So we could have up to nine.\nprofessor e: And right now we can have up to six.\ngrad c: Right. And we have five, we 're getting one more.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: And it's um, about nine hundred dollars for the base station, and then eight hundred per channel.\nprofessor e: Oh. So yeah so the only Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that's nine hundred dollars.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: Oh, we should do it.\ngrad c: OK. OK, so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd b: I don't quite understand how that how that works,. If So we 're not increasing the number of channels. OK.\ngrad c: No, we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working,\nphd b: OK.

Yeah.\npostdoc f: Well, so um, should we we don't wan wanna do the recording status first, or?\ngrad c: Well, we have about thirty - two hours uh as of, I guess a week and a half ago, so we probably now have about thirty - five hours.\nprofessor e: And and that's that's uh How much of that is digits?

The next step is to that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first, and then channelized. What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked, that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout, and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh, Liz requested in terms of um, um in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers, and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about. Um, for example, i they 'll say uh \" ninety - two \". And you know, so how you could \ngrad c: Nine two,\npostdoc f: e Exactly.\ngrad c: right.\npostdoc f: So if you just say \" nine two \", the there are many s ways that could have been expressed. An - and I just had them I I mean, a certain number of them did put the words down, but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by, um, a gloss th and things.\nphd b: You know, Jane?\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Um, one suggestion and you may already be doing this, but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things, if you um, just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them, a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis\ngrad c: Misspelled.\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc f: You 're talking about the type token frequency listings, and I use those too. Y you mean just uh on each on each line there's a one word right? It's one token from the from the corpus.\nphd b: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: Yeah, those are e extremely efficient and I and I I agree that's a very good use of it.\nphd b: Oh so you already have that, OK.\npostdoc f: Well that's that's a way that's You know, the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes, that's that's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon.\nphd b: Mm - hmm. Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other, and uh,\npostdoc f: Exactly. And then you ca then you can do a s\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: i in alphabetized lists, they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier.\npostdoc f: Absolutely. I agree. That's a very good that's a very good uh, suggestion. And that was that's my strategy for handling a lot of these things, in terms of things that need to be glossed. I didn't get to that point but So there are numbers, then there are acronyms, and then um, there's a he she wants the uh, actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is, so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized, like cough or like laugh or whatever, \" NONVOC \" for door - slam, and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error.\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: I already had that convention\nphd b: Oh that's great.\npostdoc f: but I I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter. That was what I was always planing on. So that, you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying, you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \",\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: then y you know it's it's You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter, than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space,\nphd b: Yeah.\npostdoc f: so man So many ways that error prone.\nphd b: Right. Right.\npostdoc f: So, um, um I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter, into these tagged uh, subcategorized comments, and same thing with you know, we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying,\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: you end up with a s with uh, you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: and you can um, have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes.

And you know, so how you could \ngrad c: Nine two,\npostdoc f: e Exactly.\ngrad c: right.\npostdoc f: So if you just say \" nine two \", the there are many s ways that could have been expressed. An - and I just had them I I mean, a certain number of them did put the words down, but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by, um, a gloss th and things.\nphd b: You know, Jane?\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Um, one suggestion and you may already be doing this, but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things, if you um, just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them, a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis\ngrad c: Misspelled.\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc f: You 're talking about the type token frequency listings, and I use those too. Y you mean just uh on each on each line there's a one word right? It's one token from the from the corpus.\nphd b: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: Yeah, those are e extremely efficient and I and I I agree that's a very good use of it.\nphd b: Oh so you already have that, OK.\npostdoc f: Well that's that's a way that's You know, the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes, that's that's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon.\nphd b: Mm - hmm. Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other, and uh,\npostdoc f: Exactly. And then you ca then you can do a s\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: i in alphabetized lists, they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier.\npostdoc f: Absolutely. I agree. That's a very good that's a very good uh, suggestion. And that was that's my strategy for handling a lot of these things, in terms of things that need to be glossed. I didn't get to that point but So there are numbers, then there are acronyms, and then um, there's a he she wants the uh, actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is, so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either \" VOC \" for vocalized, like cough or like laugh or whatever, \" NONVOC \" for door - slam, and \" GLOSS \" for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error.\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: I already had that convention\nphd b: Oh that's great.\npostdoc f: but I I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter. That was what I was always planing on. So that, you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying, you get a whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \",\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: then y you know it's it's You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter, than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space,\nphd b: Yeah.\npostdoc f: so man So many ways that error prone.\nphd b: Right. Right.\npostdoc f: So, um, um I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter, into these tagged uh, subcategorized comments, and same thing with you know, we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying,\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: you end up with a s with uh, you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: and you can um, have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes. But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand, because, you know I mean, jus\ngrad c: You don't know what they could be.\nphd b: Yeah.\npostdoc f: Yeah now TIMIT's clear um and PLP is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known, in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say \" nine two \" or you can say \" ninety - two \",\ngrad c: So how are you doing the \npostdoc f: and uh I 'd handle the numbers individually.\ngrad c: How are you doing the uh, acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript?\npostdoc f: It would be separate The letters would be separated in space\ngrad c: OK.\npostdoc f: and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but I 'm not sure if that's necessary, clarifying what it is,\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: so gloss of whatever.\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: I don't know if that's really necessary to do that. Maybe it's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh, a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there, and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it's uh the you know, uh enumerated, or i\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc f: it's not a good way of saying but it's it's the specific uh way of stating these these letters.\ngrad c: Right. So it sounds good.\npostdoc f: And so anyway, the clean those are those things and then channelized is to then um, get it into this multichannel format. And at that point then it's ready for use by Liz and Don. But that's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized, the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad c: Right.\npostdoc f: And uh, Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um, up and running and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean, and channelized.\nphd a: I actually gave\ngrad c: Have you also been doing spot checks, Jane?\npostdoc f: Oh yes.\ngrad c: Okay, good.\npostdoc f: Well you see that's part of the cleaning process. I spent um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers,\ngrad c: Oh good. Good.\npostdoc f: and I went through it last night, it's it's almost spooky how similar these are, word for word.

{"fname": "academic_test_13", "dialogue": "grad a: Alright, so I 'm - I should read all of these numbers?\nprofessor b: OK.\ngrad e: Piece of paper? I could borrow?\ngrad a: Oh yeah.\nprofessor b: OK, so uh i um I don't know whether Ami's coming or not um but I think we oughta just get started.\ngrad e: Nancy is uh currently in Berkeley but not here?\ngrad c: Nancy's still stick?\nprofessor b: Don't know. Anyway\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor b: Oh, so there you go. Anyway, so my idea f for today and we can uh decide that that isn't the right thing to do was to at spend at least part of the time trying to eh build the influence links, you know which sets of things are uh relevant to which decisions and actually I had uh specific s suggestion to start first with the path ones. The database ones being in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done and so to do that so there's and the idea was we were gonna do two things\ngrad c: Is your mike on?\nprofessor b: Ah. Oh right, well. Yeah. We were gonna do two things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what\ngrad d: That's funny.\nprofessor b: and then as a uh separate but related task uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we what we need to do. Once so but du we should sort of have all of the uh basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it. So I didn't did you get a chance to look at all yet?\ngrad d: Yeah, I looked at some of that stuff.\nprofessor b: Great. OK so let's start with the uh belief - nets, the general influence stuff and then we 'll then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff.\ngrad e: Well I think one could go there's I think we can di discuss everything. First of all this I added, I knew from sort of basically this has to be there right? Um\nprofessor b: Oh are you gonna go there or not? Yeah, so one i\ngrad e: Given given uh uh not transverse the castle, the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just\nprofessor b: Right, true. Does have to be there. And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that\ngrad e: And Hmm? So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely uh one of the basic ones. We can start with that. Interesting effect. Um Is this basically true or false or maybe we 'll get\nprofessor b: Well \ngrad d: Which one?\ngrad e: what?\ngrad a: \" Go there \".\ngrad e: m right.\nprofessor b: so there is this question about\ngrad e: Here we we actually get just probabilities,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: right for each down here.\nprofessor b: When we 're yeah when we 're done. So so\ngrad e: Hmm.\nprofessor b: the the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it's, you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: right? And so that a decision would be do we want that so you could two different things you could do, you could have all those values for Go - there or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when.\ngrad e: When. How.\nprofessor b: Yeah and so forth.\ngrad e: Why,\nprofessor b: So I 'll let\ngrad e: yeah.\nprofessor b: we 'll see.\ngrad e: Hmm?\ngrad a: I mean it seems that you could um uh it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them separate or binary, Go - there and then the the possibilities of how to go there because \nprofessor b: OK, that's let's start that way.\ngrad a: because, you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time.\ngrad e: Hmm. Hmm. OK. And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user? Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A. We should be be clear. But when it comes to sort of writing down when you when you do these things is it here? You sort of have to a write the values this can take.\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad e: And here I was really uh in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because um this case it's pretty simple, but as we will see the other ones um for example if it's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget? So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished.\ngrad a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: No uh\ngrad e: How can I write here that this is something, a number that cr keeps on changing? But OK. Thus is understandable?\ngrad a: Think so.\ngrad c: Yes.\ngrad e: So here for example.\nprofessor b: You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith, these belief - net things?\ngrad a: Uh, no, but I think I 'm following it. So far.\ngrad e: So here is the the we had that the user's budget may influence the outcome of decisions.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad d: Hmm.\ngrad e: There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things.\ngrad d: Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend? OK, h well I mean how is it different from user finance?\ngrad e: Um the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life, he is he cheap, average, or spendy?\ngrad d: Alright.\ngrad e: And um I didn't come uh maybe a user I don't know, I didn't want to write greediness, but\ngrad a: Yeah. Hmm.\nprofessor b: Or cheapness.\ngrad e: Welcome.\ngrad a: User thrift.\ngrad e: Welcome.\nprofessor b: Thrift, that's good.\ngrad d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Great.\ngrad e: There it is.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So Keith w what's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So this is not just a display, this is actually a GUI to a simulator that will if we tell it all the right things we 'll wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end.\ngrad a: OK. OK.\ngrad e: And it's so simple even I can use it.\ngrad a: Wow, that is simple.\ngrad e: OK, so here was OK, I can think of uh people being cheap, average, or spendy or we can even have a a finer scale moderately cheap,\nprofessor b: Doesn't matter.\ngrad e: doesn't matter. Agree there but here um I wasn't sure what to write in.\nprofessor b: Let's go ahead.\ngrad d: Well, I mean you 've written in you 've written in what uh seems to be required like what else is is do you want?\ngrad e: If that's permissible then I 'm happy.\nprofessor b: Well yeah. So here's here's what's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gonna have to be updated and n it's not a belief update, right? It's you took some actions, you spent money and stuff, so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net. Right?\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And then what you 're going to need is uh for the things that it influences. Well let's first of all let's see if it does influence anything. And if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the the number here to something that's relevant to the decision there. So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things.\ngrad e: Hmm. Yeah this is where um OK anyways let's forget it.\nprofessor b: Well that's fine. Well anyway, go ahead.\ngrad e: OK, and so this, oh that\ngrad d: The other thing is that um every time that's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it's updated or only when we need to?\nprofessor b: Yeah, that's a good question. And uh does it have a lazy mode? I don't remember.\ngrad d: Uh Well, I mean, in Srini's thing there was this thing there was this um option like proper inferences which suggests that uh doesn't happen, automatically.\nprofessor b: Oh right. Yeah. S probably does. Yeah someone has to track that down, but I but uh And and and I think actually uh\ngrad e: I just accidentally Oops.\nprofessor b: one of the we w items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non - local. I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying.\ngrad d: Well\ngrad e: Oh just uh accidentally erased this, I I just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had \" Is he staying in our hotel? \", \" Is he staying with friends? \", and so forth\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: uh so we 're OK.\nprofessor b: So it's clear where w w w where we are right now. So my suggestion is we just pick uh\ngrad e: Something down here?\nprofessor b: one, you know one uh particular one of the uh well let's do the first first one let's do the one that we sort of already think we did so w that was the of the endpoint?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. And um Oops.\ngrad d: Is hmm\ngrad e: Ah,\ngrad d: So it's true or false?\nprofessor b: No, that's that's a\ngrad e: OK. No no no, EVA.\ngrad d: So\ngrad e: Missed that one.\ngrad c: What's the difference between mode and endpoint?\ngrad d: I thought mode, yeah.\nprofessor b: although that\ngrad e: Um mode was um\nprofessor b: Well, that's\ngrad d: Mode of transportation?\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad d: OK. Also true or false.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: No, he has he hasn't filled them in yet, is what's true.\ngrad d: Yeah, OK.\ngrad e: Did I or didn't I? Ah. Probably nothing done yet, oh I just did it on the upper ones, OK. Makes sense. OK, so this was EVA. Maybe we can think of more things, cross\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad a: Climb, rob.\nprofessor b: OK.\ngrad e: climb, emerge\nprofessor b: No no no, these are ju that's just a point,\ngrad c: Uh\ngrad d: Well some of those are subsumed by approach.\nprofessor b: this is ju\ngrad c: Would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it?\ngrad a: The Charles Bridge, you know.\nprofessor b: Yeah, would be a f for a given segment. You know, you y you go first go the town square\ngrad c: Well I eh\ngrad a: No, I mean, if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge and doesn't really matter which way you cross which where you end up at the end but the part the good part is walking over it, so.\nprofessor b: That's subtle, but true. Anyway so let's just leave it three with three for now\ngrad e: Mm - hmm, mmm. Yeah.\nprofessor b: and let's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started.\ngrad e: OK, we\nprofessor b: You 'll see it you 'll see something comes up immediately, that the reason I wanna do this.\ngrad e: w well the uh user was uh definitely more likely to enter if he's a local\nprofessor b: Right. Right.\ngrad e: more likely to view if he's a tourist um and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um\nprofessor b: We did, but the three things w that that it contributed to this in fact, the other two aren't up there. so one was the ontology\ngrad e: We 'll d what type of building is it?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And the and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse.\ngrad e: What he has mentioned before.\nprofessor b: OK, so this is w Right, so what w I what we seem to need here, this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff\ngrad a: mm - hmm\nprofessor b: the way we had been designing this, there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse. So each of those the way we had it designed, now we can change the design, but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations\ngrad a: mm - hmm\nprofessor b: so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes\ngrad e: Uh we can load it up it you know very simple.\ngrad a: So\nprofessor b: and then what you and I have to talk about is, OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined? But the they 're they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about.\ngrad e: So this was adjusted for this one mode thing.\ngrad d: Oh yes.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: So that's w w in our uh in in Johno's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter, view, or approach something.\nprofessor b: Oh, it was called mode, so this this is m mode here means the same as endpoint.\ngrad e: Is now this endpoint.\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor b: OK, why don't we ch can we change that?\ngrad e: We can just rename that, yeah.\nprofessor b: Alright. You know, but that was actually, yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate versio that's I don't think what we would currently do.\ngrad a: Can I ask about \" slurred \" and \" angry \" as inputs to this?\nprofessor b: That's a\ngrad a: What why?\ngrad d: Like they 're either true or false\ngrad e: The prosody?\ngrad a: OK.\ngrad d: and they uh oh I see.\ngrad c: If the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or, you know\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. OK. Drunk.\ngrad d: Therefore\ngrad c: And, you know, possibly uh\ngrad a: Less likely to enter.\ngrad c: some,\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad c: yeah.\ngrad d: uh I was thinking less likely to view\nprofessor b: Yeah. But that's - that seems to, yeah. So so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence.\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: But yeah, that was what he had in mind.\ngrad d: Right.\nprofessor b: So let's think about this this question of how do we wanna handle so there 're two separate things. One is uh at least two. One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about, and this is another technical thing Bhaskara, is uh can we arrange so that I think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items. So the let's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing, the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site, you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: OK, et cetera. So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set, so that some somehow someone would find this word, look it up in the ontology, pull out these properties, put it into the belief - net, and then the decision would flow.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Now\ngrad e: Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot, em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here, for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um\nprofessor b: Right. Right.\ngrad e: if it's exhibiting itself it is a landmark,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: meaning more likely to be viewed\nprofessor b: Yep.\ngrad e: if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this, then it's more likely to be entered.\nprofessor b: I uh that's I think that's completely right and um I think that's good, right? So what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and in particular so so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling\ngrad e: Accessibility.\nprofessor b: no, accessibility meant\ngrad e: If it's closed one probably won't enter. Or if it's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it,\nprofessor b: OK.\ngrad e: given that he knows it, of course.\nprofessor b: Alright. So let me suggest this. Uh w could you move those up about halfway. Uh The ones that you th And selling I guess.\ngrad e: Yeah, all all of these if it's fixing things selling things, or servicing things\nprofessor b: Right. So here here's what it looks like to me. is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling, f fixing, or servicing. So that it uh that is, for certain purposes, it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other. Does that seem right? So we di\ngrad c: Basic you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision?\nprofessor b: if we Yes.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So if well it may be more than endpoint decisions, so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three\ngrad e: These three?\nprofessor b: Yeah. Eh ser s uh selling, fixing, and servicing.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad d: What ex um and so either those is true f or false?\nprofessor b: Uh Uh well it it i here's where it gets a little tricky.\ngrad d: So\nprofessor b: Uh from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it's interest it's it's important to know what it's selling or servicing and so forth.\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So for this decision it's just uh true or false\ngrad d: OK. Yeah.\nprofessor b: and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want.\ngrad d: OK.\nprofessor b: That that if any of those things is true then it's the kind of place that you uh\ngrad e: Um more likely to enter.\nprofessor b: are more likely to enter.\ngrad d: So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing?\nprofessor b: You could, yeah. Yeah, so let's do that. No no, no eh to to an inter no, an intermediate node.\ngrad d: T\ngrad e: Oh, OK.\nprofessor b: That's the p part of the idea, is\ngrad e: Um is is that the object type node?\nprofessor b: I d\ngrad e: So are they the is it the kind of object that sells, fixes, or services things?\nprofessor b: Well, o open up object type and let's see what its values are.\ngrad e: Oh I just created it, it has none so far.\nprofessor b: Oh, well OK first of all it's not objects, we called them entities, right?\ngrad e: Yeah. And then we have sort of the um\nprofessor b: Let's say I put commercial.\ngrad e: Yeah, I w I was just gonna commercial action inside where people p\nprofessor b: Well couldn't I do let's do commercial uh landmark and\ngrad e: And where was the accessible, yeah.\nprofessor b: Well accessible I think is different cuz that's tempor that that varies temporally,\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: whereas this is a\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: What would a hotel fall under?\nprofessor b: I would call that a service, but but I don't know.\ngrad c: Well I mean in terms of entity type?\nprofessor b: Say w w well it's co I would s a a again for this purpose I think it's commercial. Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business.\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad d: Um what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify?\ngrad e: Um things. So places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things.\ngrad d: Uh - huh. OK. OK. That also points to entity type I guess.\ngrad a: So we 're deriving um this the this feature of whether the the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there? Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity?\nprofessor b: Well you could, that's a that's a choice.\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: So uh\ngrad a: I mean it seems like that's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and you know indoor places that do something else\nprofessor b: Yeah, the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision,\ngrad a: and Hmm.\nprofessor b: now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway, this i\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: at a mental level that's what we we 're gonna have to sort out.\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: So, you know what does this look like, what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing, what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and what's the best way to organize this so that um it's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff.\ngrad a: OK. I 'm just thinking about how people, human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that it must be going on inside or something.\ngrad e: Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things, it can either em do s do sell things, fix things, service things, exhibit things, it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: it's not either or mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Many come to mind. Things can be generally um a landmark and be accessible. IE a a castle or can be a landmark a or not accessible, some statue\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: you know can go inside.\nprofessor b: OK. Anyway so let me suggest you do something else. Uh which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint.\ngrad e: Could we just move it like this?\nprofessor b: No no, I don't want the link there at all.\ngrad e: Oh, OK.\nprofessor b: Because what we 're gonna want is an intermediate thing which is uh the endpoint decisi the endpoint decision based o on the user models, so what we we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions, so let's make a new node\ngrad e: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad c: Just as a suggestion maybe you could \" save as \" to keep your old one nice and clean and so you can mess with this one.\ngrad e: Mmm. The old one was not that not that important, I think but\ngrad c: OK, well, not a big deal then.\ngrad e: Let's do it then.\ngrad c: Well the Isn't there a \" save as \" inside of java base?\ngrad e: But I can just take this\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad e: copy it somewhere else. This was user something\nprofessor b: Well this was\ngrad e: or\nprofessor b: uh let's p put it this let's do endpoint underbar - U.\ngrad e: end point?\nprofessor b: i endpoint, e end poi this is sa\ngrad e: Ah.\nprofessor b: it's the endpoint\ngrad e: Gotcha, yeah.\nprofessor b: let's say underbar - U, so that's the endpoint decision uh as seen through the\ngrad c: As related from the user model.\nprofessor b: Right. So let's let's actually yeah so lin you can link that up to the\ngrad e: Should I rename this too?\nprofessor b: uh yeah, so that, I guess that's endpoint uh\ngrad e: It's underscore - E.\nprofessor b: underscore - E for entity, and we may change all this, but. Right. And\ngrad e: OK, shouldn't I be able to move them all? No. Or? Can I? Where? What?\nprofessor b: Oh I d eh I don't know. Actually, I guess the easiest thing would move mo move the endpoint, well, go ahead. Just do whatever.\ngrad e: Wasn't this possible?\nprofessor b: Well.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad c: I think you have to be in move mode before\ngrad e: Uh - huh. OK.\nprofessor b: Good. Right.\ngrad e: So now we 're looking for user related things that um\nprofessor b: Yeah. And uh maybe th maybe it's just one who is the user, I don't know, maybe maybe there's more.\ngrad a: Huh.\ngrad e: Well if he's usi if he's in a car right now what was that people with Harry drove the car into the cafe\nprofessor b: Never mind. Uh anyway, this is crude. Now but the now so so but then the question is uh so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology, but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse.\ngrad e: Well let's should we finish this,\nprofessor b: Sure,\ngrad e: I mean but surely the user interests\nprofessor b: OK.\ngrad c: The user thrift, the user budget.\ngrad e: yeah, yeah\nprofessor b: Well, maybe, I again, I d well, OK, put em in but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually uh\ngrad c: Well is \ngrad e: Here this was one of my problems we have the user interest is a is a vector of five hundred values, so um That's from the user model,\ngrad d: Oh you mean level of interest?\ngrad e: mm - hmm, no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in.\ngrad a: Well \nprofessor b: somebody else has built this user model.\ngrad d: Oh I see,\ngrad e: Gothic churches versus Baroque townhouses versus\ngrad d: right. So why is it oh it, so it's like a vector of five hundred one's or zero's?\ngrad e: Yea - n is that\ngrad d: Like for each thing are we are you interested in it or not?\ngrad e: yeah uh I I think\ngrad d: I see.\ngrad a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: OK. So uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that. Alright? One is um you could ignore it. But the other thing you could do is have an and this will give you the flavor of the of what you could have a node that's that was a measure of the match between the object's feature, you know, the match between the object the entity, I 'm sorry and the user.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Uh.\nprofessor b: So you could have a k a \" fit \" node and again that would have to be computed by someone else\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but uh so that uh\ngrad e: Just as a mental note uh\nprofessor b: Yeah, that's all.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. And and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering?\nprofessor b: Yeah. I mean, we could.\ngrad e: Yeah. And also if it's an expensive place to enter, this may also\nprofessor b: OK.\ngrad d: Budget.\ngrad a: User schedule. \" Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome or do I just have to \" \" time to take a picture of the outside? \"\ngrad e: Schedule?\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad c: It seems like everything in a user model a affects \nprofessor b: Well that's what we don't wanna do, see that se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: an\ngrad c: Cuz if the, I mean, and if the user is tired, the user state,\ngrad d: Well\ngrad c: right, it would affect stuff, but I can't see why e anything w everything in the model wouldn't be\nprofessor b: Well, but\ngrad d: Right.\nprofessor b: Well, that that's we can't do that, so we we 're gonna have to\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: but this is a good discussion, we 're gonna have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that uh so if there's some general notion of for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is the uh compatibility with his current state, so that's what you 'd have to do, you 'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact, so it could be compatibility with his current state which would include his money and his time and and his energy\ngrad c: Yeah, just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level.\ngrad d: Right.\nprofessor b: It does.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Yeah, but\ngrad d: No but, it's more than that, like the the more sort of you break it up like because if you have everything pointing to one node it's like exponential whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it's not exponential anymore.\nprofessor b: So it yeah, there are two advantages. That's tha there's one technical one\ngrad c: Sh - sh yeah, \nprofessor b: and the other is it it gets used\ngrad c: S so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping? Subgrouping, basically into mo\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad c: so basically make it more tree like going backwards?\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Right. But it there's two advantages, one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential uh CBT's,\ngrad e: Bhaskara?\nprofessor b: the other is it can be it presumably can be used for multiple decisions.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was u\ngrad d: Right.\nprofessor b: not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it's used in multiple places. Anyway th so in general this is the design, this is really design problem.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK, you 've got a signal, a d set of decisions um how do we do this?\ngrad e: What do I have under user state anyhow cuz I named that already something. Oh that's tired, fresh, yeah. Maybe should be renamed into physical state.\nprofessor b: Or fat user fatigue even.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad e: That's with a \" G \"?\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Whatever.\ngrad e: Then we can make a user state.\nprofessor b: What's th what we 're talking about is compatibility. Uh or something, I don't know, but.\ngrad c: I guess the the question uh is It's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again. Or user compatibility.\nprofessor b: Oh but the thing is that we uh uh we had some things that uh\ngrad e: That don't.\nprofessor b: that don't\ngrad e: The user interests and the user who who who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke\ngrad c: Sure, but other I thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action, right?\nprofessor b: the right\ngrad c: Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something.\nprofessor b: Uh maybe not. I mean the that's the the issue is um would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of. And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible.\ngrad e: Maybe um if we look at the if we split it up again into sort of um if we look at the uh the endpoint again we we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions so you can only enter a place if you are not too tired to do so and also eh have the money to do so if it costs something so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions. Viewing usually is cheap or free.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Is that always true? I don't know.\ngrad c: Well, with the way we 're defining it I think yeah.\nprofessor b: W w but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it's free cuz you\ngrad e: And so is approaching.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: Well what about the Grand Canyon, right? No, never mind. I mean are there are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like, I mean never mind, not in the current \nprofessor b: No we have to enter the park.\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: Eh almost by definition um paying involves entering,\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: ge going through some\ngrad a: OK. Right, sure.\nprofessor b: Right. Uh So let me suggest we switch to another one, I mean clearly there's more work to be done on this\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but I think it's gonna be more instructive to to think about uh other decisions that we need to make in path land. And what they 're gonna look like.\ngrad c: So you can save this one as and open up the old one, right and and then everything would be clean. You could do it again.\nprofessor b: Why, I think it's worth saving this one but I think I 'd I 'd like to keep this one\ngrad d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: cuz I wanna see if if we 're gonna reuse any of this stuff.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Um so this might be What next?\nprofessor b: Well you tell me, so in terms of the uh planner what's what's a good one to do?\ngrad e: Well let's th this go there or not I think is a good one.\nprofessor b: Uh\ngrad e: Is a very basic one. So what makes things more likely that \nprofessor b: Well the fir see the first thing is, getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse.\ngrad e: So\nprofessor b: So Keith this is gonna get into your world because uh we 're gonna want to know you know, which constructions indicate various of these properties\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: s and so I I don't yet know how to do this, I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So that that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse, and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for\ngrad e: We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint.\nprofessor b: Of of course.\ngrad e: Identified that\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: and so again re that's completely correct, we have the user model, the situation model here, we don't have the discourse model here yet. Much the same way as we didn't we don't have the ontology here.\nprofessor b: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting, selling, and so forth.\ngrad e: Really.\nprofessor b: So in some sense it's it's there.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet.\ngrad e: Yeah. Um This be specific for second year? Um And and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint.\nprofessor b: But if we do it 'll have the three values.\ngrad e: Hmm?\nprofessor b: It 'll have the EVA values if if we have it.\ngrad e: Yeah. Yeah. OK just for starters and here discourse um\nprofessor b: For Go - there, probably is true and false, let's say. That's what we talked about.\ngrad e: um well, I think um we 're looking at the the little data that we have, so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: So this should sort of push it in one direction\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad e: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And sometimes um people say where is it\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably\nprofessor b: Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that you 're you want these two values.\ngrad e: Oh yeah, true. So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it's either yep, yay, A, or nay. Yeah. OK?\nprofessor b: And they 'll be a y uh, a user Go - there and maybe that's all, I don't know.\ngrad d: Situation Go - there, I mean, because it's whether it's open or not.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: OK, good.\ngrad d: That definitely interes\nprofessor b: Yep.\ngrad d: But that now that kind of um what's the word\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: um the that interacts with the uh EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it's fine to go there when it's closed whereas if they want to um\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad d: so\nprofessor b: Right, so that's that's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting, so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it's closed or not\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: in terms of uh uh you know, whether whether you wanna go there.\ngrad d: The time of day,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: right I well, right.\ngrad c: It does matter though if there's like a strike or riot or something.\nprofessor b: Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter.\ngrad d: Right. So yeah, that's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this that node by itself wouldn't distinguish\nprofessor b: Well i i it can have di various values. Yeah, but we eh you you 're right it might not be enough.\ngrad d: Yeah, I mean, see I 'm I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false.\ngrad a: Well, what Whoops.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: Right.\nprofessor b: Ah. I see that could be.\ngrad a: Also, that node, I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: you know, there's different things, the strikes and the\nprofessor b: Could be. Yeah. N\ngrad d: Like situation traffic and so on.\ngrad a: Yeah, the time of day.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. So so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link, and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision\ngrad d: I guess the final\nprofessor b: maybe the t they 're final re and, I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node. And I don't worry about layout,\ngrad d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean then we 'll go we 'll go nuts but\ngrad d: Mmm.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into?\nprofessor b: Could be, yeah.\ngrad d: Right. Because that's what we, I mean that's why this situation comes up.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well the Go - there, actually the Endpoint node could feed feed into the Go - there S That's right,\ngrad d: Yeah, right.\nprofessor b: so the Endpoint node,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: make that up t t to the Go - there then\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point, but something like that. Now it's gonna be important not to have loops by the way. Uh really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops\ngrad e: I was just gonna\nprofessor b: uh\ngrad d: Yes.\ngrad e: How long does it take you to to compute uh\nprofessor b: No it's much worse than that. It if i loo it it it it it's not def i it's not well defined if you 're there are loops,\ngrad d: It things don't converge, yeah.\ngrad e: uh R recursive action?\nprofessor b: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't uh OK.\ngrad e: Uh but this isn't, this is this line is just coming from over here.\ngrad d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah, no it's not a loop yet, I 'm just saying we we, in no, in\ngrad d: Yeah. Well, but the good thing is we we could have loopy belief propagation which we all love.\ngrad e: Mmm.\nprofessor b: Right. OK, so anyway, so that's another decision. Uh what's what's another decision you like?\ngrad e: OK, these have no parents yet, but I guess that sort of doesn't matter. Right?\nprofessor b: Well, the idea is that you go there, you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the uh the discourse is is a mystery.\ngrad e: I mean this is sort of This comes from traffic and so forth, yeah. Sh - Should we just make some\nprofessor b: Sure, if you want.\ngrad e: um if there's parking maybe Mmm Oh who cares. OK. And if he has seen it already or not and so forth,\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad e: OK. Um and discourse is something that sort of should we make a Keith note here?\nprofessor b: Sure.\ngrad e: That sort of comes from Keith.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Just sort of so we don't forget. Oops. Have to get used to this. OK, whoops.\ngrad a: Um actually \nprofessor b: And then also the discourse endpoint, I I guess endpoint sub - D is if you wanna make it consistent.\ngrad c: Wh - ah.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Um actually is this the the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the, I mean\nprofessor b: I think so. S\ngrad a: uh, hmm OK. But that still allows for the possibility of the of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from \nprofessor b: Maybe not, a Right.\ngrad a: That all that that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node.\nprofessor b: Uh y you yeah you i you if you needed to do that.\ngrad a: Uh. If you needed it to do that.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: But uh OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible possible asking of the user\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: you know hey there's a strike on, uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something\nprofessor b: Ah. Good point, I don't I don't know how we 're going to t uh\ngrad a: or Yeah, so that might not come out of a user model but, you know, directly out of interaction.\nprofessor b: Right. Uh I gu yes my curr you know, don't yeah yeah yeah that's enough.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: you know, given that you know there's a strike do you still wanna go?\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff, then you would ask him do you wanna go?\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. OK.\nprofessor b: But I think trying to formulate the conditional question, that sounds too much.\ngrad a: Right, right. Yeah. Right, sure, OK.\nprofessor b: To me.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Alright, but let me let let's stay with this a minute\ngrad e: But\nprofessor b: because I want to do a little bit of organization. Before we get more into details. The organization is going to be that uh the flavor of what's going on is going to be that uh as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed Keith is going to to worry about the various constructions that people might use\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard,\ngrad a: Alright.\nprofessor b: so what's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates, OK uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net. I j wa I I assume everybody knows that, I just wanna you know, get closure that that 'll be the game then,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes. And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it isn't by any means uh necessarily a simple thing that you want out. So uh if there is an and there is mode of transportation\ngrad e: And it there's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what's the utterance go giving us\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: and then what's the discourse history give us.\nprofessor b: Yeah, well that, well, we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: That's uh two things then.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Mmm.\nprofessor b: an and it's not clear yet. I mean it could be those are two separate things, it could be that the discourse gadget itself integrates em as which would be my guess that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that um you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say I wanna go back there,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: wow, what does that mean and uh\ngrad e: Mm - hmm\ngrad a: Now. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Alright. So\ngrad e: But is th is this picture that's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry or is it that we get for each each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub - E, sub - D, sub - U and maybe a sub - O \" O \" for \" ontology \" um meta node\nprofessor b: I don't know.\ngrad e: but it might just\nprofessor b: It could be.\ngrad e: could be\nprofessor b: This is this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next,\ngrad e: so this\nprofessor b: which is s if that's true uh how do we wanna combine those? O or when it's true?\ngrad e: but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that, you know, we only have at most four at the moment um arrows going f to each of the uh bottom decisions.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad e: And four you we can handle.\nprofessor b: No.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad e: It's too much?\nprofessor b: Well i i it see i if it's fou if it's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big CPT, it's not s completely impossi I mean it's it's not beyond what the system could solve but it's probably beyond what we could actually uh write down. or learn.\ngrad e: Right, true.\nprofessor b: Uh but, you know it's four to the fourth. It's pretty big. Uh.\ngrad c: Two fifty - six,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad c: is that what that\nprofessor b: Yeah, I mean it's and I don't think it's gonna g e I don't think it 'll get worse than that by the way, so le that's a that's a good\ngrad d: Mmm yeah.\ngrad e: But but four didn't we decide that all of these had true or false? So is it's four\nprofessor b: Uh for go there, but not f but not for the other one's three values for endpoint already.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Yeah, I mean you need actually three to the five because uh well I mean if if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values\ngrad c: Right.\ngrad d: so I mean it can get big fast.\ngrad e: Um for endpoint? No it's it's sh\nprofessor b: EV - it's the EVA.\ngrad e: yeah, down here, but this one only has two.\nprofessor b: No.\ngrad d: No it still has three,\nprofessor b: Since ta they will still have three.\ngrad d: EVA.\nprofessor b: Each so you 're uh uh from each point of view you 're making the same decision.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So from the point of view of the ob of the entity\ngrad e: Want to view that, yeah yeah. C sl\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: yeah\ngrad d: This and also, I mean, the other places where, like for example consider endpoint view, it has inputs coming from user budget, user thrift\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad d: so even\nprofessor b: Those are not necessarily binary. S so we 're we 're gonna have to use some t care in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode. And in fact I think it doesn't in the sense that um Read it, you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff I think it isn't like you have two hundred and fifty - six different uh ways of of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place. Alright. So we we just have to figure out what the regularities are and and code them. But um What I was gonna suggest next is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer but I do want to also talk about the thing that we started into now of uh well it's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place what rule of combination is used there.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So th yes they so these things all affect it,\ngrad a: Right.\nprofessor b: how do they affect it? And belief - nets have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that. So is it it's it's clearer n clear enough what the issue is,\ngrad d: Right.\nprofessor b: right? So do we wanna switch that now or we wanna do some more of this?\ngrad e: R basically w we just need to sort of in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gonna get this picture sort of uh completely messy.\nprofessor b: Well, here he here's one of the things that that I th you sh you no, I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface but you it would be great if you could actually just display at a given time uh all the things that you pick up, you click on \" endpoint \", OK and everything else fades\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and you just see the links that are relevant to that. And I does anybody remember the GUI on this?\ngrad c: Uh d I would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make you know N - many belief - nets and then open them every time you wanted to look at a different one\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: vers cuz uh\ngrad e: It's probably pretty easy do it to do it in HTML, just \ngrad c: Yeah, but\ngrad e: Uh\ngrad d: HTML?\ngrad e: Yeah I have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then li consider that it's respective,\nprofessor b: Yeah the well the b\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad e: but\nprofessor b: anyway so uh it clear that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram.\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Alright, so e we have to figure out some eh eh uh basically display hack or something to do this because anyway I I let me consi suggest that's a s not a first - order consideration, we have two first - order considerations which is what are the uh influences A, A, and B how do they get combined mathematically, how do we display them is an issue, but um\ngrad c: I don't, yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support something like that.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah, I I mean, it might soon, if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes.\nprofessor b: Right. Yeah, and Um I that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into, but um we have to know what we want first. OK, so why don't you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what what the choices might be for these?\ngrad d: So Ah, sorry. I guess that's\ngrad c: You can technically wear that as you 're talking.\ngrad d: Yeah, it's right, I guess I can do that.\ngrad a: Darn.\nprofessor b: Put it in your, yeah.\ngrad d: I guess this board works fine. So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node. Right? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down. So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set, right? These are all like saying EV or A, right? So it's not just a generalized situation like I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know, um sorta weighted combination.\ngrad e: Hmm. ROVER, the ROVER decision.\ngrad d: The what decision?\ngrad e: ROVER. All of their outputs combined to make a decision.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah. So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those, right? That's the way belief - nets are defined, like each node given its parents, right? So um that's what we want, we want for example P of um let's call this guy Y and let's call these X - one, X - two XN, right. So we want probability that Y equals, you know, for example um E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something, uh the co like all of them? Given that for example the data says you know, A, V, A, E, or something right?\nprofessor b: Yep.\ngrad d: So we would like to do this kind of combination.\nprofessor b: Alright, so um Is that uh I yeah, I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on.\ngrad a: I think so, yeah.\nprofessor b: It's it's cl e is is it clear what he wants to compute?\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Right. So, right. So Basically um what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E, s give a number\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: because that's obviously not desirable. What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution, so we want it to um add up to one, right?\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: So those are the two things that we uh need. So what uh I guess, what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we, you know view these guys as voting and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages, right? So for example here two people have voted for A, one has voted for V, and one has voted for E, so we could say that the probabilities are, you know, probability of being E is one over four, because one person voted for E out of four and similarly, probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four and probability of V is one out of four. Right? So that's step that's the uh yeah that's the that's the basic uh thing. Now\ngrad e: Um Yeah.\ngrad d: Is that all OK?\ngrad e: And that one outcome, that's\nprofessor b: What?\ngrad e: it's X X - one voted for A X - two voted for V\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: and so forth?\nprofessor b: Y right. Yep.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things, which may or may not be a good assumption,\ngrad e: That's the outcome.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Right.\nprofessor b: so that\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah. So step two is um right. So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know, some w be that for example, what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said, like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh\ngrad c: X - one matters more i than X - two or\ngrad d: Right. Sure, so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by uh W - one, W - two, W - three, and W - four\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: right? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um X - hat, we just need that the W's sum to one. So they can be for example, you know you you could have point one, point three, point two, and point four, say.\ngrad e: That's one.\ngrad d: And that 'd be one. So that um also seems to work fine. And uh\ngrad c: So I jus just to make sure I understand this, so in this case um we would still compute the average?\ngrad d: You 'd compute the weighted average, so the probability of E would be uh\ngrad c: OK, so so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh W one times \ngrad a: Point three.\ngrad c: or A or let's see, one full quarter times point one\ngrad d: Not one quarter,\ngrad a: No.\ngrad d: so these numbers have been replaced with point one, point three, point two, and point four. So you can view these as gone.\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad d: Probability of\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah. OK. So, alright. So this is uh step two. So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert, right, whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable. So the way this is handled is by what's called a mixture of experts, so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \", OK? This is a hidden variable. And what this is is it gets its input from X - one, X - two, X - three, and X - four, and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation. Right? And then these guys all come here. OK. So this is sightly uh more complicated. So what's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable. So H produces some you know, it produces a number, either one, two, three, or four, in our situation, right? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it's two, and then he just selects the uh thing. That's all there is to say, I guess about it. Right, so you can have a mixture that\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad a: So so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs. It's driving how the other four are interpreted. OK.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad c: So H passes a vector on to the next node?\ngrad d: It could.\ngrad c: It could? A vector of the weights as the se\ngrad d: Yeah, it could\ngrad c: oh.\ngrad d: Sorry?\ngrad a: Well a vector with three zero's and one one, right?\ngrad c: Oh it's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it's in or which one of the weighting systems\ngrad d: Right, so I mean the way you desc\ngrad c: W I was just, if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too, couldn't you? OK.\ngrad a: Um Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha, beta, whatever, or is the that's determined by what the experts are saying, like the type of situ OK. Hmm. OK. OK. I mean It it just seems that like without that that outside input that you 've got a situation where, you know, like if if uh X - one says no, you know, a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one, you know, I mean that seems like that 'd be weird,\ngrad d: Yeah, well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also.\ngrad a: right? Oh, OK. OK. Alright, right.\ngrad c: Oh The situations that H has, are they built into the net or OK, so they they could either be hand coded or learned or OK.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad c: Based on training data, OK.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yes.\ngrad c: So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations. Oh yeah.\ngrad d: Yeah. Um Well, I mean to learn them we need data, where are we gonna get data? Well I mean we need data with people intentions, right?\ngrad a: Right, right.\ngrad d: Which is slightly tricky. Right.\ngrad a: Uh - huh.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. But what's the data about like, are we able to get these nodes from the data?\ngrad a: Like how thrifty the user is, or do we have access to that? Mm - hmm. Oh right. Oh good. OK.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. OK.\ngrad d: Yeah, but that's my question, like how do we I mean, how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - E, or endpoint sub uh you know s S?\ngrad c: Well, basically you would say, based on in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was,\ngrad d: Mmm. Mmm.\ngrad c: right?\ngrad d: So this is what we wanna learn. Yep. Right. Hmm. Yeah. I don't think, well you have a can you bring up the function thing? Um w where is the thing that allows you to sort of\ngrad c: That's on the added variable, isn't it?\ngrad d: Oh function properties, is that it? Hmm, I guess not. Yeah, that's\ngrad a: No.\ngrad d: Right. OK. And um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely, I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such CPU's on your own in the java base format. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was assuming that's what we 'd always do because yeah I was assuming that's what we 'd always do, it's Right. Yeah.\ngrad c: Ah. Well in terms of java base I think it's basically what you see is what you get in I don't yeah, I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here.\ngrad a: So Yeah. Yeah. By the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things uh is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on? Like, I mean, what kind of questions are being given being asked? Cuz OK. Yeah yeah. OK. OK. Fey, you mean. OK. OK. O OK. OK. I 'm just wondering, because in terms of, you know, I mean uh w the figure I was thinking about this figure that we talked about, fifty constructions or whatever that's uh that's a whole lot of constructions and um you know, I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer so, I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. OK. OK. I mean, I I I I was uh I was talking about the, you know, if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty do I do, I wanna see what people are using, so Well, it will inspire me.

So what makes things more likely that \nprofessor b: Well the fir see the first thing is, getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse.\ngrad e: So\nprofessor b: So Keith this is gonna get into your world because uh we 're gonna want to know you know, which constructions indicate various of these properties\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: s and so I I don't yet know how to do this, I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So that that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse, and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for\ngrad e: We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint.\nprofessor b: Of of course.\ngrad e: Identified that\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: and so again re that's completely correct, we have the user model, the situation model here, we don't have the discourse model here yet. Much the same way as we didn't we don't have the ontology here.\nprofessor b: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting, selling, and so forth.\ngrad e: Really.\nprofessor b: So in some sense it's it's there.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet.\ngrad e: Yeah. Um This be specific for second year? Um And and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint.\nprofessor b: But if we do it 'll have the three values.\ngrad e: Hmm?\nprofessor b: It 'll have the EVA values if if we have it.\ngrad e: Yeah. Yeah. OK just for starters and here discourse um\nprofessor b: For Go - there, probably is true and false, let's say. That's what we talked about.\ngrad e: um well, I think um we 're looking at the the little data that we have, so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: So this should sort of push it in one direction\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad e: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And sometimes um people say where is it\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably\nprofessor b: Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that you 're you want these two values.\ngrad e: Oh yeah, true. So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it's either yep, yay, A, or nay. Yeah. OK?\nprofessor b: And they 'll be a y uh, a user Go - there and maybe that's all, I don't know.\ngrad d: Situation Go - there, I mean, because it's whether it's open or not.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: OK, good.\ngrad d: That definitely interes\nprofessor b: Yep.\ngrad d: But that now that kind of um what's the word\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: um the that interacts with the uh EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it's fine to go there when it's closed whereas if they want to um\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad d: so\nprofessor b: Right, so that's that's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting, so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it's closed or not\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: in terms of uh uh you know, whether whether you wanna go there.\ngrad d: The time of day,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: right I well, right.\ngrad c: It does matter though if there's like a strike or riot or something.\nprofessor b: Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter.\ngrad d: Right. So yeah, that's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this that node by itself wouldn't distinguish\nprofessor b: Well i i it can have di various values. Yeah, but we eh you you 're right it might not be enough.\ngrad d: Yeah, I mean, see I 'm I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false.\ngrad a: Well, what Whoops.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: Right.\nprofessor b: Ah. I see that could be.\ngrad a: Also, that node, I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: you know, there's different things, the strikes and the\nprofessor b: Could be. Yeah. N\ngrad d: Like situation traffic and so on.\ngrad a: Yeah, the time of day.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. So so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link, and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision\ngrad d: I guess the final\nprofessor b: maybe the t they 're final re and, I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node. And I don't worry about layout,\ngrad d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean then we 'll go we 'll go nuts but\ngrad d: Mmm.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into?\nprofessor b: Could be, yeah.\ngrad d: Right. Because that's what we, I mean that's why this situation comes up.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well the Go - there, actually the Endpoint node could feed feed into the Go - there S That's right,\ngrad d: Yeah, right.\nprofessor b: so the Endpoint node,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: make that up t t to the Go - there then\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point, but something like that. Now it's gonna be important not to have loops by the way. Uh really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops\ngrad e: I was just gonna\nprofessor b: uh\ngrad d: Yes.\ngrad e: How long does it take you to to compute uh\nprofessor b: No it's much worse than that. It if i loo it it it it it's not def i it's not well defined if you 're there are loops,\ngrad d: It things don't converge, yeah.\ngrad e: uh R recursive action?\nprofessor b: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't uh OK.\ngrad e: Uh but this isn't, this is this line is just coming from over here.\ngrad d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah, no it's not a loop yet, I 'm just saying we we, in no, in\ngrad d: Yeah.

So what makes things more likely that \nprofessor b: Well the fir see the first thing is, getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse.\ngrad e: So\nprofessor b: So Keith this is gonna get into your world because uh we 're gonna want to know you know, which constructions indicate various of these properties\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: s and so I I don't yet know how to do this, I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So that that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse, and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for\ngrad e: We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint.\nprofessor b: Of of course.\ngrad e: Identified that\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: and so again re that's completely correct, we have the user model, the situation model here, we don't have the discourse model here yet. Much the same way as we didn't we don't have the ontology here.\nprofessor b: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting, selling, and so forth.\ngrad e: Really.\nprofessor b: So in some sense it's it's there.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet.\ngrad e: Yeah. Um This be specific for second year? Um And and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint.\nprofessor b: But if we do it 'll have the three values.\ngrad e: Hmm?\nprofessor b: It 'll have the EVA values if if we have it.\ngrad e: Yeah. Yeah. OK just for starters and here discourse um\nprofessor b: For Go - there, probably is true and false, let's say. That's what we talked about.\ngrad e: um well, I think um we 're looking at the the little data that we have, so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: So this should sort of push it in one direction\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad e: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And sometimes um people say where is it\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably\nprofessor b: Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that you 're you want these two values.\ngrad e: Oh yeah, true. So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it's either yep, yay, A, or nay. Yeah. OK?\nprofessor b: And they 'll be a y uh, a user Go - there and maybe that's all, I don't know.\ngrad d: Situation Go - there, I mean, because it's whether it's open or not.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: OK, good.\ngrad d: That definitely interes\nprofessor b: Yep.\ngrad d: But that now that kind of um what's the word\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: um the that interacts with the uh EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it's fine to go there when it's closed whereas if they want to um\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad d: so\nprofessor b: Right, so that's that's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting, so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it's closed or not\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: in terms of uh uh you know, whether whether you wanna go there.\ngrad d: The time of day,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: right I well, right.\ngrad c: It does matter though if there's like a strike or riot or something.\nprofessor b: Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter.\ngrad d: Right. So yeah, that's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this that node by itself wouldn't distinguish\nprofessor b: Well i i it can have di various values. Yeah, but we eh you you 're right it might not be enough.\ngrad d: Yeah, I mean, see I 'm I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false.\ngrad a: Well, what Whoops.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: Right.\nprofessor b: Ah. I see that could be.\ngrad a: Also, that node, I mean the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: you know, there's different things, the strikes and the\nprofessor b: Could be. Yeah. N\ngrad d: Like situation traffic and so on.\ngrad a: Yeah, the time of day.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. So so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link, and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint uh decision\ngrad d: I guess the final\nprofessor b: maybe the t they 're final re and, I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node. And I don't worry about layout,\ngrad d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean then we 'll go we 'll go nuts but\ngrad d: Mmm.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into?\nprofessor b: Could be, yeah.\ngrad d: Right. Because that's what we, I mean that's why this situation comes up.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well the Go - there, actually the Endpoint node could feed feed into the Go - there S That's right,\ngrad d: Yeah, right.\nprofessor b: so the Endpoint node,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: make that up t t to the Go - there then\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point, but something like that. Now it's gonna be important not to have loops by the way. Uh really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops\ngrad e: I was just gonna\nprofessor b: uh\ngrad d: Yes.\ngrad e: How long does it take you to to compute uh\nprofessor b: No it's much worse than that. It if i loo it it it it it's not def i it's not well defined if you 're there are loops,\ngrad d: It things don't converge, yeah.\ngrad e: uh R recursive action?\nprofessor b: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't uh OK.\ngrad e: Uh but this isn't, this is this line is just coming from over here.\ngrad d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah, no it's not a loop yet, I 'm just saying we we, in no, in\ngrad d: Yeah.

{"fname": "academic_test_18", "dialogue": "professor b: Alright, so e we have to figure out some eh eh uh basically display hack or something to do this because anyway I I let me consi suggest that's a s not a first - order consideration, we have two first - order considerations which is what are the uh influences A, A, and B how do they get combined mathematically, how do we display them is an issue, but um\ngrad c: I don't, yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support something like that.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah, I I mean, it might soon, if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes.\nprofessor b: Right. Yeah, and Um I that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into, but um we have to know what we want first. OK, so why don't you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what what the choices might be for these?\ngrad d: So Ah, sorry. I guess that's\ngrad c: You can technically wear that as you 're talking.\ngrad d: Yeah, it's right, I guess I can do that.\ngrad a: Darn.\nprofessor b: Put it in your, yeah.\ngrad d: I guess this board works fine. So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node. Right? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down. So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set, right? These are all like saying EV or A, right? So it's not just a generalized situation like I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know, um sorta weighted combination.\ngrad e: Hmm. ROVER, the ROVER decision.\ngrad d: The what decision?\ngrad e: ROVER. All of their outputs combined to make a decision.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah. So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those, right? That's the way belief - nets are defined, like each node given its parents, right? So um that's what we want, we want for example P of um let's call this guy Y and let's call these X - one, X - two XN, right. So we want probability that Y equals, you know, for example um E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something, uh the co like all of them? Given that for example the data says you know, A, V, A, E, or something right?\nprofessor b: Yep.\ngrad d: So we would like to do this kind of combination.\nprofessor b: Alright, so um Is that uh I yeah, I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on.\ngrad a: I think so, yeah.\nprofessor b: It's it's cl e is is it clear what he wants to compute?\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Right. So, right. So Basically um what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E, s give a number\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: because that's obviously not desirable. What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution, so we want it to um add up to one, right?\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: So those are the two things that we uh need. So what uh I guess, what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we, you know view these guys as voting and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages, right? So for example here two people have voted for A, one has voted for V, and one has voted for E, so we could say that the probabilities are, you know, probability of being E is one over four, because one person voted for E out of four and similarly, probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four and probability of V is one out of four. Right? So that's step that's the uh yeah that's the that's the basic uh thing. Now\ngrad e: Um Yeah.\ngrad d: Is that all OK?\ngrad e: And that one outcome, that's\nprofessor b: What?\ngrad e: it's X X - one voted for A X - two voted for V\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: and so forth?\nprofessor b: Y right. Yep.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things, which may or may not be a good assumption,\ngrad e: That's the outcome.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Right.\nprofessor b: so that\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah. So step two is um right. So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know, some w be that for example, what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said, like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh\ngrad c: X - one matters more i than X - two or\ngrad d: Right. Sure, so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by uh W - one, W - two, W - three, and W - four\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad d: right? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um X - hat, we just need that the W's sum to one. So they can be for example, you know you you could have point one, point three, point two, and point four, say.\ngrad e: That's one.\ngrad d: And that 'd be one. So that um also seems to work fine. And uh\ngrad c: So I jus just to make sure I understand this, so in this case um we would still compute the average?\ngrad d: You 'd compute the weighted average, so the probability of E would be uh\ngrad c: OK, so so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh W one times \ngrad a: Point three.\ngrad c: or A or let's see, one full quarter times point one\ngrad d: Not one quarter,\ngrad a: No.\ngrad d: so these numbers have been replaced with point one, point three, point two, and point four. So you can view these as gone.\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad d: Probability of\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah. OK. So, alright. So this is uh step two. So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert, right, whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable. So the way this is handled is by what's called a mixture of experts, so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \", OK? This is a hidden variable. And what this is is it gets its input from X - one, X - two, X - three, and X - four, and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation. Right? And then these guys all come here. OK. So this is sightly uh more complicated. So what's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable. So H produces some you know, it produces a number, either one, two, three, or four, in our situation, right? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it's two, and then he just selects the uh thing. That's all there is to say, I guess about it. Right, so you can have a mixture that\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad a: So so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs. It's driving how the other four are interpreted. OK.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad c: So H passes a vector on to the next node?\ngrad d: It could.\ngrad c: It could? A vector of the weights as the se\ngrad d: Yeah, it could\ngrad c: oh.\ngrad d: Sorry?\ngrad a: Well a vector with three zero's and one one, right?\ngrad c: Oh it's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it's in or which one of the weighting systems\ngrad d: Right, so I mean the way you desc\ngrad c: W I was just, if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too, couldn't you? OK.\ngrad a: Um Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha, beta, whatever, or is the that's determined by what the experts are saying, like the type of situ OK. Hmm. OK. OK. I mean It it just seems that like without that that outside input that you 've got a situation where, you know, like if if uh X - one says no, you know, a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one, you know, I mean that seems like that 'd be weird,\ngrad d: Yeah, well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also.\ngrad a: right? Oh, OK. OK. Alright, right.\ngrad c: Oh The situations that H has, are they built into the net or OK, so they they could either be hand coded or learned or OK.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad c: Based on training data, OK.\ngrad d: Yeah. Yes.\ngrad c: So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations.

Whether the and this i we actually have a separate feature but I decided to put it on the same line for space. \" Nice walls \" which we can look up because I mean if you 're gonna get real close to a building in the Tango mode, right, there's gotta be a reason for it. And it's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls. The context, which in this case we 've limited to \" business person \", \" tourist \", or \" unknown \", the time of day, and \" open to suggestions \", isn't actually a feature. It's \" We are open to suggestions. \"\ngrad d: Right. can I just ask the nice walls part of it is that uh, in this particular domain you said be i it could be on two different lines but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmark - iness cor is correlated with\ngrad b: Oh \ngrad c: No. We have a separate\ngrad b: They 're separate things.\ngrad c: feature.\ngrad d: their being nice w\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad b: I either could put \" nice walls \" on its own line or \" open to suggestions \" off the slide.\ngrad c: Like you could have a p\ngrad d: And and By \" nice \" you mean \ngrad c: You Like you could have a post office with uh you know, nice murals or something.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad b: Or one time I was at this \ngrad d: So \" nice walls \" is a stand in for like architecturally it, uh significant\ngrad b: But see the thing is, if it's \ngrad c: Architecturally appealing from the outside.\ngrad d: or something like that. OK.\ngrad b: Yeah but if it's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from Like you m might be able to \" Vista \" it,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: right? And be able to \ngrad a: Appreciate it.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Yeah, versus, like, I was at this place in Europe where they had little carvings of, like, dead people on the walls or something.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: I don't remember w\ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad b: It was a long time ago.\ngrad d: There's a lot of those.\ngrad b: But if you looked at it real close, you could see the the in intricacy of the of the walls.\ngrad d: OK. So that count as counts as a nice wall.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad d: The OK. Right.\ngrad a: The \ngrad d: Something you want to inspect at close range because it's interesting.\ngrad b: Exactly.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad b: Robert?\ngrad a: Well there there is a term that's often used. That's \" saliency \", or the \" salience \" of an object. And I was just wondering whether that's the same as what you describe as \" landmark - iness \". But it's really not. I mean an object can be very salient\ngrad d: Hmm.\ngrad a: but not a landmark at all.\ngrad d: Not a landmark at all. There's landmark for um, touristic reasons and landmark for I don't know navigational reasons or something.\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: Yeah, we meant, uh, touristic reasons.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad d: OK. but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um, goals.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad d: Right?\ngrad b: But Yeah. Tourist - y landmarks also happen to be Wouldn't couldn't they also be They 're not exclusive groups, are they? Like non - tourist - y landmarks and\ngrad a: Or it can be als\ngrad b: direct navigational \ngrad d: They 're not mutually exclusive?\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad d: Right. Definitely.\ngrad b: OK, So our initial idea was not very satisfying, because uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node. Uh.\ngrad d: So, a big flat structure.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad d: Right?\ngrad c: Yep.\ngrad b: And uh, so we Reasons being, you know, it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that. If we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort, uh according Bhaskara we 'd be handicapped. I don't know belief - nets very well.\ngrad c: Well usually, I mean, you know, N If you have N features, then it's two to the N  or exponential in N.\ngrad b: And they wouldn't look pretty. So.\ngrad c: Yeah, they 'd all be like pointing to the one node.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Uh. So then our next idea was to add a middle layer, right? So the thinking behind that was we have the features that we 've drawn from the communication of some Like, the someone s The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea, like \" I 'm \" the the abstract idea being \" I am a tourist I want to go to this place. \" Right? So we 're gonna set up features along the lines of where they want to go and what they 've said previously and whatnot. And then we have the means that they should use. Right? but the middle thing, we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out, like, the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines. Or Yes, we could things we couldn't extract the from the data, the hidden variables. Yes, good. So then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour, running an errand, or whether they were in a hurry, because we were thinking uh, if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th\ngrad c: Want to do Vista,\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: right? Because if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry.\ngrad b: Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a like a navigational point to go to another place.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Whether the destination was their final destination, whether the destination was closed. Those are all And then \" Let's look at the belief - net \" OK. So that means that I should switch to the other program. Um right now it's still kind of in a toy version of it, because we didn't know the probabilities of  or Well I 'll talk about it when I get the picture up.\ngrad a: No one knows it.\ngrad b: OK. So this right what we Let's see. What happens if I maximize this? There we go. But uh So. The mode basically has three different outputs. The probability whether the probability of a Vista, Tango, or Enter. Um The \" context \", we simplified. Basically it's just the businessman, the tourist, unknown. \" Verb used \" is actually personally amusing mainly because it's it's just whether the verb is a Tango verb, an Enter verb, or a Vista verb.\ngrad c: Yeah, that one needs a lot of \ngrad d: And are those mutually exclusive sets?\ngrad b: No.\ngrad c: Not at all. That's that that needs a lot of work.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad c: But uh that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter,\ngrad d: Got it. Uh - huh.\ngrad c: so we decided that for the purposes of this it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs.\ngrad d: Yeah. Simple.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad d: Stab at it. Yep.\ngrad b: Right. Um Why don't you mention things about this, Bhaskara, that I am not that are not coming to my mind right now.\ngrad c: OK, so Yeah, so note the four nodes down there, the sort of, the things that are not directly extracted. Actually, the five things. The \" closed \" is also not directly extracted I guess, from the uh \ngrad b: Well i it's \ngrad c: Hmm.\ngrad d: From the utterance?\ngrad b: it's so it sort of is\ngrad c: Actually, no, wait.\ngrad b: because it's because have the the time of day\ngrad c: It is. OK, \" closed \" sort of is.\ngrad b: and the close it just had the er and what time it closed.\ngrad c: Right, so f Right, but the other ones, the final destination, the whether they 're doing business, whether they 're in a hurry, and whether they 're tourists, that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things.\ngrad d: Inferred from the other ones?\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad c: And the mode, you know, depends on all those things only.\ngrad b: Yeah the  the actual parse is somewhere up around in here.\ngrad c: Yeah. So we haven't uh, managed Like we don't have nodes for \" discourse \" and \" parse \", although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: But uh The idea is that we just extract those features from them, so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: because we 'd never do inference on it anyway, so.\ngrad d: So some of the the top row of things What's what's \" Disc admission fee \"?\ngrad c: whether they discuss the admission fees. So we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like \" Can I get to this place? \"\ngrad d: Oh.\ngrad c: \" What is the admission fee? \". So that's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to Enter the place rather than uh to Tango or Vista,\ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad c: so.\ngrad d: I see.\ngrad b: There were there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee, but you know, we didn't have \ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: That was like our example.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: That was the initial one that we found.\ngrad d: OK. So there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic - based um, concept cues\ngrad b: From the discourse that Yeah.\ngrad d: for one of those. And then in that second row or whatever that row of Time of Day through that So all of those Some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad d: Right? So that you have no distinction between those and OK.\ngrad b: One, uh Uh. Um, anything else you want to say Bhaskara?\ngrad c: Um.\ngrad d: \" Unmark @ @ Time of Day \"\ngrad c: Yeah, I m I mean \ngrad a: Yeah. They 're they 're are a couple of more things.\ngrad b: One thing uh \ngrad a: I mean Uh. I would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all uh, agree on what what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe what changes we \ngrad b: Yeah, th OK. so one thing I I 'm you know unsure about, is how we have the discus uh the \" admission fee \" thing set up. So one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this, Uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept, but you could see perhaps discus the \" admission fee \" going directly to the mode pointing at \" Enter \",\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: right? Versus pointing to just at \" tourist \",\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: OK?\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: But we just decided to keep all the things we extracted to point at the middle and then down.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Why is the landmark OK. The landmark is facing to the tourists. That's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible um\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Navigational landmarks,\ngrad d: Navigational cue.\ngrad a: navigational landmarks\ngrad b: yeah.\ngrad a: so Mm - hmm. Then \ngrad b: Yeah, that would be whatever building they referred to.\ngrad d: Prosody.\ngrad c: Right. So let's see. The variables.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Disc - \" admission fee \" is a binary thing, \" time of day \" is like morning, afternoon, night. Is that the deal? Yeah.\ngrad b: That's how we have it currently set up,\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad b: but it could be, you know, based upon hour\ngrad c: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad a: Whatever granularity.\ngrad b: or dis we could discrete it des descret - ize it.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Uh - huh.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Yeah. Normally context will include a huge amount of information, but um, we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not, I guess.\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad d: OK. So that's given in their input.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: So Right,\ngrad d: Right?\ngrad c: so it's not really all of context. Similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. that's very nice, huh?\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad a: The the So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist?\ngrad c: and\ngrad a: Or also unknown?\ngrad b: Or un unknown,\ngrad a: OK.\ngrad b: yeah.\ngrad c: Yeah. Unknown, right?\ngrad d: So final dest So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist,\ngrad c: Which is th Which one?\ngrad d: but OK. so the the context being um, e I don't know if that question's sort of in general, \" are you \" I mean the ar ar are do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment?\ngrad c: Yeah, it does.\ngrad d: OK. So then you just have some probabilities over \ngrad c: Everything is probablistic, and There's always \ngrad d: OK. over which which of those it is.\ngrad c: Yeah. Um, right. So then landmark is Oh, sorry. \" Verb used \" is like, right now we only have three values, but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Rather, let me rephrase that. It it can take values in the set of all verbs, that they could possibly use.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Um \" nice walls \" is binary, \" closed \" is binary \" final destination \", again Yeah, all those are binary I guess. And \" mode \" is one of three things.\ngrad a: So, the the middle layer is also binary? No.\ngrad c: Yeah, anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node.\ngrad a: Uh. It Yeah. But all those things without question marks are also binary. Right?\ngrad c: Which things?\ngrad a: Nice walls?\ngrad b: Wi\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Oh. \" Nice walls \" is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Yeah, a Oh yeah. Sorry. It is binary.\ngrad b: It is binary but it doesn't have question mark because it's extracted.\ngrad c: That's true. Yeah. OK, I see your point.\ngrad a: Yeah. OK.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad a: I I gotcha.\ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad c: Yeah, similarly \" closed \", I guess.\ngrad a: So we can either be in a hurry or not, but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment?\ngrad c: Well, we To do that we would add another uh value for that.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. OK.\ngrad c: And that would require s updating the probability distribution for \" mode \" as well.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Take a conti\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: So um, of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases\ngrad a: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: but you can imagine that it's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would that would help you Like it's a conjunction of, I don't know, you know, the verb used and some other stuff that that would determine \ngrad c: Right. Other syntactic information you mean?\ngrad d: Yeah. Exactly.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Um.\ngrad a: well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object right? the argument in a sense?\ngrad d: Usually. I I don't know if that's always the case I I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have. So. Um.\ngrad a: that's always warping on something some entity,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: and um Uh maybe at this stage we will we do want to uh sort of get uh modifiers in there\ngrad b: Hmm. Yeah.\ngrad a: because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not\ngrad b: I want to get to the church quickly,\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: and uh \ngrad c: Yeah, right.\ngrad d: That would be a cue.\ngrad a: what's the fastest way\ngrad c: Yeah, correct.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Um. OK.\ngrad b: Right. Excellent. Do we have anything else to say about this?\ngrad c: We can do a little demo.\ngrad b: Oh the Yeah, we could. But the demo doesn't work very well.\ngrad a: No, then it wouldn't be a demo I was just gonna s\ngrad c: I mean We can do a demo in the sense that we can um, just ob observe the fact that this will, in fact do inference.\ngrad b: Observe nodes.\ngrad c: So we can, you know, set some of the uh nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes.\ngrad d: Yeah. Go ahead.\ngrad b: OK. Dat - dat - dah. What should I observe?\ngrad c: Just se set a few of them. You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time. Just like uh, maybe the fact that they use a certain verb \ngrad b: OK.\ngrad c: Actually forget the verb.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad c: just uh I don't know, say they discussed the admission fee \ngrad b: OK.\ngrad c: and uh the place has nice walls\ngrad b: I love nice walls, OK? I 'm a big fan.\ngrad c: and it's night.\ngrad d: it's starting to grow on me\ngrad b: And the time of day is night?\ngrad c: Yeah, no wait. That that doesn't uh it's not really consistent. They don't discuss the admission fee. Make that false.\ngrad b: Alright.\ngrad c: And it's night.\ngrad b: Oh, they OK. Oh whoops. I forgot to uh \ngrad c: That didn't work.\ngrad b: Ach!\ngrad d: I 'd like to do that again.\ngrad b: One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that and do this.\ngrad d: Yeah. That seems kind of redundant but.\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad b: That all you want?\ngrad c: Yes.\ngrad b: OK. So let's see. I want to query,\ngrad c: \" Go \" and, right, \" query \".\ngrad b: right? the mode. OK, and then on here So let's see.\ngrad c: So that is the probability that they 're Entering, Vista - ing or Tango - ing.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad c: And uh \ngrad d: So slightly biased toward \" Tango \" ing\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad b: If it's night time, they have not discussed admission fee, and the n walls are nice.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad b: So, yeah. I guess that sort of makes sense. The reason I say the demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we uh  observed everything in favor of taking a tour, and it came up as \" Tango \", right? Over and over again. We couldn't we couldn't figure out how to turn it off of \" Tango \".\ngrad d: So. Uh - huh.\ngrad c: It loves the Tango.\ngrad d: Huh! Um.\ngrad c: Well, that's obviously just to do with our probabilities.\ngrad b: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad c: Like, we totally hand - tuned the probabilities,\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad c: right. We were like \" hmm, well if the person does this and this and this, let's say forty percent for this,\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad c: fifty per \" Like, you know. So obviously that's gonna happen.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad a: Yeah but it it\ngrad d: Maybe the bias toward \" Tango \" ing was yours, then?\ngrad b: Yeah,\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad b: that's that's at \ngrad c: It's So we have to like fit the probabilities.\ngrad b: Spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte.\ngrad d: So, the real case?\ngrad a: However you know, it The purpose was not really, at this stage, to come up with meaningful probabilities but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer. And so th\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: And \ngrad b: We would actually I guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden nodes,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad b: but I 'd like to see more. Not because it would expedite the probabilities, cuz it wouldn't. It would actually slow that down tremendously.\ngrad c: Um. Well, yeah, I guess.\ngrad b: But.\ngrad c: Not that much though. Only a little early.\ngrad b: No, I think we should have uh exponentially more middle nodes than features we 've extracted. I 'm ju I 'm just jo\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad d: So. Are \" doing business \" versus \" tourist \" They refer to your current task. Like like current thing you want to do at this moment.\ngrad c: Um. Yeah, well That's that's an interesting point. Whether you 're It's whether It's not \ngrad d: And are th\ngrad c: I think it's more like \" Are you are tourist? are you in Ham - like Heidelberg for a \"\ngrad d: Oh, so, I thought that was directly given by the context switch.\ngrad c: That's a different thing. What if the context, which is not set, but still they say things like, \" I want to go uh, see the uh the the castle and uh, et cetera. \"\ngrad a: Is it \ngrad b: Well the I kind of thought of \" doing business \" as more of running an errand type thing.\ngrad c: Yeah. Business on the other hand is, uh, definitely what you 're doing.\ngrad a: So if you run out of cash as a tourist, and and and you need to go to the AT\ngrad b: So i wi th\ngrad d: OK. Oh, I see, you may have a task. wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage.\ngrad a: Mmm.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: \" How do I get to the bank? \"\ngrad d: I see. Hmm.\ngrad c: And that 'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you kinda thing.\ngrad d: OK. So the \" tourists \" node should be um, very consistent with the context node. Right? If you say that's more their in general what their background is.\ngrad c: Yeah, I think this context node is a bit of a I don't know, like in d Uh Do we wanna have Like it's \ngrad d: Are you assuming that or not? Like is that to be I mean if that's accurate then that would determine tourist node.\ngrad c: If the context were to set one way or another, that like strongly uh um, says something about whether whether or not they 're tourists.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: So what's interesting is when it's not when it's set to \" unknown \".\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: We - what set the they set the context to \" unknown \"?\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad c: Right now we haven't observed it, so I guess it's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: But yes, you can set it to un \" unknown \".\ngrad a: And if we now do leave everything else as is the results should be the same,\ngrad b: Oops.\ngrad a: right?\ngrad b: No.\ngrad c: Well no, because we Th - the way we set the probabilities might not have Yeah, it's it's an it's an issue, right? Like \ngrad a: Pretty much the same?\ngrad c: Yeah, it is. So the issue is that um in belief - nets, it's not common to do what we did of like having, you know, a d bunch of values and then \" unknown \" as an actual value. What's common is you just like don't observe the variable,\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad c: right, and then just marginalizes \ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad c: But uh We didn't do this because we felt that there 'd I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually \ngrad b: We were thi Yeah,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: We were th\ngrad c: But uh I don't know y what the right thing is to do for that. I 'm not I don't know if I totally am happy with the way it is.\ngrad a: Why don't we Can we, um How long would it take to to add another node on the observatory and, um, play around with it?\ngrad c: Another node on what?\ngrad b: Uh, well it depends on how many things it's linked to.\ngrad a: Let's just say make it really simple. If we create something that for example would be um So th some things can be landmarks in your sense but they can never be entered? So for example s a statue.\ngrad c: Good point.\ngrad a: Yeah?\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: So maybe we wanna have \" landmark \" meaning now \" enterable landmark \" versus, um something that's simply just a vista point, for example.\ngrad b: Yeah, that's true.\ngrad a: Yeah? uh, a statue or um \ngrad c: So basically it's addressing a variable that's \" enterable or not \". So like an \" enterable, question mark \".\ngrad b: Also  you know, didn't we have a size as one? The size of the landmark.\ngrad c: What?\ngrad b: Cuz if it's \ngrad c: Um. Not when we were doing this,\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad c: but I guess at some point we did.\ngrad b: For some reason I had that OK, that was a thought that I had at one point but then went away.\ngrad c: So you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered?\ngrad a: Well, for example, if we include that, yeah?\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: um, accessibility or something, yeah? \" Is it Can it be entered? \"\ngrad c: Hmm.\ngrad a: then of course, this is sort of binary as well.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: And then um, there's also the question whether it may be entered. In the sense that, you know, if it's Tom the house of Tom Cruise, you know, it's enterable but you may not enter it. You know? You 're not allowed to.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Unless you are, whatever, his his divorce lawyer or something.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Yeah? and um And these are very observable sort of from the from the ontology sort of things.\ngrad b: Way Does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though? Whether it's practically speaking enterable, or actually physically enterable or not?\ngrad a: y y If If you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al w you 're not usually not allowed to uh m\ngrad d: It seems like it would for uh, uh determining whether they wanna go into it or not.\ngrad b: Well I can see why \ngrad d: Cuz they \ngrad a: Let's get this uh b clearer. S so it's matrix between if it's not enterable, period.\ngrad b: Whether it's a Whether it's a public building, and whether it's actually has a door.\ngrad a: Yeah, exactly.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad a: This is sort of uh\ngrad b: So Tom Cruise's house is not a public building\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: but it has a door. But the thing is \ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad b: OK, sh explain to me why it's necessary to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public. Or, if something It seems like it's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door a and it \ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Or \" not public \" and \" not a door \" are equivalent things,\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad b: it seems like in practice.\ngrad a: Right. Yeah. So we would have What does it mean, then, that we have to we have an object type statue. That really is an object type. So there is there's gonna be a bunch of statues.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad a: And then we have, for example, an object type, hmm, that's a hotel. How about hotels?\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad a: So, the most famous building in Heidelberg is actually a hotel. It's the hotel Zum Ritter, which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the Thirty Years War, blah - blah - blah.\ngrad b: Hmm. Does it have nice walls?\ngrad a: It has wonderful walls. Um - And lots of detail, c and carvings, engravings and so forth,\ngrad b: Excellent.\ngrad a: so. But, um, it's still an unlikely candidate for the Tango mode I must say. But. Um. So s So if you are a d Well it's very tricky. So I guess your question is so far I have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities, from that point of view. Huh. OK. Let Let's do a Can we add, just so I can see how it's done, uh, a \" has door \" property or?\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad c: What would it, uh, connect to? Like, what would, uh, it affect?\ngrad a: Um, I think, um, it might affect Oh actually it's it  it wouldn't affect any of our nodes, right?\ngrad c: What I was thinking was if you had a like \ngrad a: Oh it's it affects th The \" doing business \" is certainly not.\ngrad b: You could affect  Theoretically you could affect \" doing business \" with \" has door \".\ngrad c: Yeah. OK.\ngrad d: Hmm.\ngrad a: It should, um, inhibit that,\ngrad c: Right.\ngrad b: Let's see.\ngrad a: right?\ngrad c: Yeah, I don't know if JavaBayes is nice about that. It might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable, you just like it just overwrites everything. But you can check.\ngrad b: Well, we have it saved. So. We can rel open it up again.\ngrad c: OK. It's true.\ngrad b: The safety net.\ngrad d: I think you could just add it. I mean, I have before OK. Whew!\ngrad c: Well that's fine, but we have to see the function now. Has it become all point fives or not?\ngrad d: Oh, right.\ngrad b: Let's see. So this is \" has door \" Uh, true, false. That's acceptable. And I want to edit the function going to that, right? Oh no.\ngrad c: No. This is fine,\ngrad b: Right. It was fine.\ngrad c: this business.\ngrad b: added this one.\ngrad c: Yep.\ngrad b: This \ngrad c: What would be nice if it is if it just like kept the old function for either value but. Nope. Didn't do it.\ngrad d: Oh.\ngrad b: Oh wait, it might be Did we w Yes, that's not good.\ngrad c: That's kind of annoying.\ngrad a: OK, so just dis dismiss everything. Close it and and load up the old state so it doesn't screw screw that up.\ngrad b: Let's see. Oops.\ngrad c: Hmm.\ngrad a: Maybe you can read in?\ngrad c: Ha - So have you used JavaBayes a lot?\ngrad d: Yes. Really I ha I 've I haven't used it a lot and I haven't used it in the last you know many months so\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad d: um, uh, we can ask someone.\ngrad c: It might be worth uh asking around.\ngrad d: Um.\ngrad c: Like, we looked at sort of uh a page that had like a bunch of \ngrad d: Yeah. Srini \ngrad c: OK. Yeah, S I guess he 'd be the person.\ngrad d: Srini's the one to ask I would say.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Um. He might know.\ngrad c: Cuz Yeah.\ngrad d: And.\ngrad c: I mean in a way this is a lot of good features in Java it's cra has a GUI and it's uh \ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: I guess those are the main two things. It does learning, it has \ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: No it doesn't, actually.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad b: I didn't think it did learning.\ngrad c: What?\ngrad b: Maybe it did a little bit of learning,\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad b: I don't remember.\ngrad c: Oh right. Maybe you 're right. OK. Right. But uh it's free.\ngrad b: Which is w quite positive, yeah.\ngrad c: But uh, yeah. Maybe another thing that uh But I mean its interface is not the greatest. So.\ngrad b: But actually it had an interface.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: A lot of them were like, you know.\ngrad d: Yep.\ngrad a: Command line.\ngrad b: Huh.\ngrad a: What is the c code? Can w can we see that? How do you write the code\ngrad b: The c\ngrad a: or do you actually never have to write any code there?\ngrad c: Yeah. There is actually a text file that you can edit. But it's You don't have to do that.\ngrad b: There's like an XML format for Bayes - nets.\ngrad c: Is it XML?\ngrad b: The - there is one. I don't know if this uses it.\ngrad c: Oh, I see. No this doesn't use it.\ngrad b: But it \ngrad c: I didn't think it did.\ngrad b: Yeah, the the \ngrad c: You can look at the text file.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad c: But do you have it here?\ngrad b: Uh, yes I do actually.\ngrad c: Well, maybe you don't.\ngrad b: Let me see.\ngrad c: Oh yes, of course.\ngrad b: Oh man,\ngrad c: Like, there's the \ngrad b: I didn't n Is there an ampersand in DOS?\ngrad c: Nope. Just s l start up a new DOS.\ngrad b: We - That's alright. I can probably double cli click on it.\ngrad c: Or Yeah, right.\ngrad a: n uh \ngrad b: Let's see.\ngrad c: Yep.\ngrad b: Let's see, come on.\ngrad c: It 'll ask you what you what it wants what you want to open it with and see what BAT, I guess.\ngrad b: One of these days, it should open this, theoretically.\ngrad a: Go Right mouse. Open with.\ngrad b: Oh there we go.\ngrad c: That's Oh!\ngrad b: Maybe it was just \ngrad a: Oh.\ngrad b: Oh! W Ah, it was dead. To the world.\ngrad d: God!\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad a: Through the old Notepad. That's my favorite editor.\ngrad b: I like I like Word Pad because it has the uh the returns,\ngrad a: Wordpad? I \ngrad b: the carriage returns on some of them.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. OK.\ngrad b: You know how they get \" auto - fills \" I guess,\ngrad a: Mmm - hmm.\ngrad b: or whatever you call it.\ngrad c: Anyway, there it is.\ngrad a: So this is sort of LISP - y? No.\ngrad c: Uh, Yeah.\ngrad b: It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Yeah. That's how actual probability tables are specified.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad c: As, like, lists of numbers.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: So theoretically you could edit that.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: It just that it's \ngrad c: But they 're not very friendly.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Yeah the ordering isn't very clear on \ngrad c: So you 'd have to like figure out Like you have to go and \ngrad d: Right. The layout of the table.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad b: Actually we could write a program that could generate this.\ngrad c: Well I Yeah. I think so.\ngrad b: Yeah you could.\ngrad d: You could.\ngrad c: it's not \ngrad b: We were doing it \ngrad c: Yeah we can maybe write an interface th for uh entering probability distributions easily, something like like a little script. That might be worth it.\ngrad a: And that might do.\ngrad d: Yeah. I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability so this is probably\ngrad c: The other thing is it is in Java\ngrad d: Yeah, it's Yeah.\ngrad c: so.\ngrad b: We could manipulate the source itself?\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad b: Or \ngrad a: Do you have the true source files or just the class?\ngrad b: I don't know if he actually \ngrad c: Yeah. Uh, yeah. we do\ngrad b: Does he \ngrad c: I I saw directory called \" source \",\ngrad b: Oh.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: I didn't e\ngrad c: or Yeah. Go up one?\ngrad b: Up one. Ah yes, good.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad b: \" Source \". That's that's quite nice.\ngrad c: I don't know if it actually manipulate the source, though. That might be a bit complicated.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: I think it might it might be simpler to just have a script that, you know It's, like, friendly,\ngrad d: The d the data tables.\ngrad c: it allows you enter things well.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad a: But if th if there is an XML file that or format that it can also read I mean it just reads this, right? When it starts.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Yeah I know there is an I was looking on the we web page and he's updated it for an XML version of I guess Bayes - nets. There's a Bayes - net spec for in XML.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: He's Like this guy has?\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad c: The JavaBayes guy? So but, e he doesn't use it. So in what sense has he updated it?\ngrad b: Well th you can either you ca or you can read both.\ngrad c: Oh. I see.\ngrad b: To my understanding.\ngrad c: OK. That would be awesome.\ngrad d: Oh.\ngrad b: Because uh Well at least the uh I could have misread the web page, I have a habit of doing that, but.\ngrad a: OK, wonderful.\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad a: So you got more slides?\ngrad b: Do I have more slides? Um yes, one more. \" Future Work \". I think every presentation have a should have a \" Future Work \" slide. But uh it's basically we already talked about all this stuff, so.\ngrad c: Um. The additional thing is I guess learning the probabilities, also. E That's maybe, I don't know If \ngrad b: Uh that's future future work.\ngrad c: Does That's Yeah.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: Very future.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: And of course if you have a presentation that doesn't have something that doesn't work at all, then you have \" What I learned \", as a slide.\ngrad d: Can't you have both?\ngrad b: You could. My first approach failed.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad b: What I learned. OK, so I think that uh our presentation's finished.\ngrad a: Good.\ngrad b: I know what I like about these meetings is one person will nod, and then the next person will nod, and then it just goes all the way around the room.\ngrad a: So the uh \ngrad d: I missed my turn.\ngrad b: No I Earlier I went and Bhaskara went and you did it. You did it.\ngrad a: It's like yawning.\ngrad d: It's like yawning.\ngrad a: And this announcement was in stereo.\ngrad c: Ha.\ngrad a: OK. So this means um \ngrad b: Should I pull up the net again?\ngrad d: Yeah. Could you put the the um, net up again?\ngrad b: Yes. There we go.\ngrad d: Thanks.\ngrad b: And actually I was cuz I got a wireless mike on.\ngrad d: So a more general thing than \" discussed admission fee \" um, could be I I 'm just wondering whether the context, the background context of the discourse might be I don't know, if there's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way um, there might be other cues that, say, um, in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes uh, I don't know if that might be \ngrad a: Mm - hmm. I think we \ngrad d: uh, and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up.\ngrad a: I think a a sort of general strategy here You know, this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee, and something else and something else, that happened in the discourse before.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Right.\ngrad a: And um let's make those four. And maybe there are two um So maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net, which has two  has it's own middle layer. Maybe this, you know, has some kind of um, funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something that is uh, a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe. So things that point towards \ngrad b: So instead of single node, for like, if they said the word \" admission fee \" \ngrad d: Exactly.\ngrad b: \" admission fee \", or maybe, you know, \" how much to enter \"\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad b: or you know something, other cues.\ngrad d: Opening hours or something like that.\ngrad b: Exactly. That would all f funnel into one node that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that.\ngrad a: So \" pay a visit \" \ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: uh uh d\ngrad c: Sure.\ngrad a: Yeah?\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse. I mean that's like the bigger um, version of it.\ngrad a: Exactly. Yeah? And then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before, um it's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a in a in a route um, sort of proceeding past these things, so this would be just something that where you want to pass it. Hmm? Is that it? However these are of course then the the nodes, the observed nodes, for your middle layer. So this again points to \" final destination \", \" doing business \", \" tourist hurry \" and so forth.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad a: Yeah? And so then we can say, \" OK. we have a whole region \" in a e\ngrad d: That's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer.\ngrad a: Yeah, exactly. And this is just then just one.\ngrad d: Right?\ngrad a: So e because at the end the more we um add, you know, the more spider - web - ish it's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing. It's going to get very ugly. But with this way we could say \" OK, these are the discourse phenomena. They ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer, um or the general hidden layer.\ngrad c: Sure.\ngrad a: And the same we will be able to do for syntactic information, the verbs used, the object types used, modifiers. And maybe there's a hidden layer for that.\ngrad c: Yep.\ngrad a: And so forth and so forth. Then we have context.\ngrad c: Yeah. So essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little Bayes - nets of their own.\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Precisely. So.\ngrad b: One thing that's kind of been bugging me when I more I look at this is that the I guess, the fact that the there's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad b: I mean, it makes it cleaner, but then uh I mean.\ngrad c: That's true.\ngrad b: For instance if the discourse does \ngrad d: What do you mean by that?\ngrad b: well for instance, the \" discourse admission fee \" node seems like it should point directly to the \ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad b: or increase the probability of \" enter directly \" versus \" going there via tourist \".\ngrad c: Yeah. Or we could like add more, uh, sort of middle nodes. Like we could add a node like do they want to enter it, which is affected by admission fee and by whether it's closed and by whether it has a door.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad c: So it's like There are Those are the two options. Either like make an arrow directly or put a new node.\ngrad b: Yeah,\ngrad d: Hmm.\ngrad b: that makes sense.\ngrad a: Yeah. And if it if you do it If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like \" So how much has it cost to enter? \" and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars, and then the persons says um \" Yeah I want to see it. \" Yeah? meaning \" It's way out of my budget \" um \ngrad b: There are places in Germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter?\ngrad a: Um, nothing comes to mind. Without thinking too hard. Um, maybe, yeah of course, um opera premiers.\ngrad b: Really?\ngrad a: So you know.\ngrad d: Hmm.\ngrad a: Or or any good old Pink Floyd concert.\ngrad b: I see. If you want to see \" The Magic Flute \" or something.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad d: Or maybe um, a famous restaurant. or, I don't know. There are various things that you might w not want to eat a meal there but your own table.\ngrad b: The Spagos of Heidelberg.\ngrad a: I think that the h I mean nothing beats the the admission charge prices in Japan. So there, two hundred dollars is is moderate for getting into a discotheque. You know. Then again, everything else is free then once you 're ins in there.\ngrad c: Really.\ngrad a: Food and drink and so forth. So. I mean. But i you know, i we can Something Somebody can have discussed the admission fee and u the answer is s if we um, you know, um still, based on that result is never going to enter that building.\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad a: You know? Because it's just too expensive.\ngrad b: Oh yeah, I think I see. So the discourse refers to \" admission fee \" but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse.\ngrad d: Yeah. you have to have some notion of not just I mean there's a there's change across several turns of discourse\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: so I don't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh, other other discourse processing that might be happen.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Yeah.  Yeah.\ngrad d: I mean.\ngrad b: What sort of discourse processing is uh are the How much is built into SmartKom and \ngrad a: It works like this. The uh, um I mean. The first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t They tried to figure out the intention, right? simply by parsing it. And this um m won't differentiate between all modes, yeah? but at least it 'll tell us \" OK here we have something that somebody that wants to go someplace, now it's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is  is happening, and um, if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed, what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it's handed on to the discourse history which is, um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules. It's it's actually the the whole memory of the entire system, that knows what wh who said what, which was what was presented. It helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted, so, um, because you say \" OK, how can I get to the castle? \" Oh, how how much is it? \" and um \" yeah I would like uh um to g let's do it \" and so forth. So even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened. so whenever the uh, um person is not actually rejecting what happened before, so as in \" No I really don't want to see that movie. I 'd rather stay home and watch TV \" um What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step, by the discourse model discourse model, Yeah, that's what it's called. and, um, it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues. So a person pointing to something on the screen, you know, the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad a: so it's a it's a rather huge huge thing but um  um  we can sort of It has a very clear interface. We can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad a: um which is a question. How deep do we want to sear, you know? Um but we should try to keep in mind that, you know, we 're doing this sort of for research, so we we should find a limit that's reasonable and not go, you know, all the way back to Adam and Eve. You know, did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life? And the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise and Anyway.\ngrad d: So one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of \" admission fee discussion \" as a cue for entry, is thinking about the plans that various people might have. Like all the different sort of general schemas that they might be following OK. This person is um, finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business. Um, because then anything that's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan. Um, I don't know. They 're in in non in sort of more traditional AI kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know, some idea at each turn of agent doing something, \" OK, wha what plans is this a consistent with? \" and then get s some more information and then you see \" here's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into \". It it might be useful here too.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: I I don't know how you know you 'd have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that.\ngrad a: I mean the u u\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad a: It's in the these these these plan schemas. I mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate, you know. \" What do you need need to buy a ticket? \"\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: You know? and it it's fifty steps,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: huh? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter, you know, and and maybe that's helpful to look at it to look at those. It's amazing what human beings can do. W when we talked uh we had the example, you know, of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands, says New York and you say Track seven, huh? And it's because you know that that person actually is following, you know You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps, you know, without any information other than \" New York \", huh? inferring everything from the context. So, works. Um, even though there is probably no train from here to New York, right?\ngrad d: Mmm. Not direct.\ngrad b: You 'd uh probably have to transfer in Chicago.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. But uh it's possible. Um, no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else. Right? Is that t San Francisco, Chicago?\ngrad b: I think \ngrad a: Is that possible?\ngrad b: One time I saw a report on trains, and I think there is a l I don't know if I thought there was a line that went from somewhere, maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad b: I could be wrong though. It was a while ago.\ngrad d: The Transcontinental Railroad, doesn't that ring a bell?\ngrad b: Yeah but I don't know if it's still \ngrad d: I think it has to exist somewhere.\ngrad b: They might have blown it up.\ngrad a: Well it never went all the way, right? I mean you always had to change trains at Omaha,\ngrad d: Well most of the way.\ngrad a: right? One track ended there and the other one started at five meters away from that\ngrad d: Uh. Mm - hmm. Yeah.\ngrad a: and sort of \ngrad d: Well. You seem to know better than we do so.\ngrad a: yeah? Has anybody ever been on an Amtrak?\ngrad d: I have. But not transcontinentally.\ngrad b: I 'm frightened by Amtrak myself.\ngrad c: What? Why?\ngrad b: I just They seem to have a lot of accidents on the Amtrak.\ngrad c: Really?\ngrad a: Their reputation is very bad.\ngrad b: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad a: huh? It's not maybe reality.\ngrad d: It's not like German trains. Like German trains are really great so.\ngrad a: But you know, I don't know whether it's which ones are safer, you know, statistically.\ngrad d: Um, but they 're faster.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Much faster. Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: And there's much more of them. Yeah, they 're Yeah, it's way better\ngrad a: yeah I used um Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast and I was surprised. It was actually OK.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: You know, on Boston New York,\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad a: New York Rhode Island,\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: whatever,\ngrad c: I 've done that kind of thing.\ngrad a: Boston.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Yeah. But That's a different issue.\ngrad b: This is going to be an interesting transcript.\ngrad a: Hmm?\ngrad c: I I want to see what it does with uh \" landmark - iness \". That's \ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad d: Let's all say it a few more times.\ngrad b: It 'd help it figure it out.\ngrad c: So.\ngrad d: Just kidding. Right.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: So by the way tha that structure that Robert drew on the board was like more um, cue - type - based, right, here's like we 're gonna segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then some of the things we 're talking about here are more you know, we mentioned maybe if they talk about um, I don't know, entering or som you know like they might be more task - based.\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad d: So I I don't know if there There's obviously some m more than one way of organizing the variables into something\ngrad a: I think that um What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks, and maybe some of their conditions.\ngrad d: so. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: One task is more likely you 're in a hurry when you do that kind of s doing business,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: and and less in a hurry when uh you 're a tourist Um tourists may have never have final destinations, you know because they are eternally traveling around so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers, that are more cue - based.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. That feed into those?\ngrad a: Nah?\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world. So, um I suggest w to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions, and we make up some  some toy a observable \" nodes \" is that what th\ngrad b: Refined y re just refine the \ngrad a: What's the technical term?\ngrad c: OK. For which?\ngrad a: For the uh nodes that are observable? The \" outer layer \"?\ngrad c: Just observable nodes,\ngrad b: The features,\ngrad c: evidence nodes?\ngrad b: I don't know, whatever you \ngrad a: Feature ma make up some features for those Identify four regions,\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: maybe make up some features for each region and uh and uh, uh and uh middle layer for those. And then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Basically just refine some of the more general nodes.\ngrad a: Yep. The - they they will be aud ad - hoc for for for some time to come.\ngrad c: Yeah, this is totally like The probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc. We need to look at all of them. I mean but, they 're even like I mean like, close to the end we were like, uh, you know we were like uh really ad - hoc.\ngrad d: It's a even distribution. Like, whatever.\ngrad c: Right? Cuz if it's like, uh If it's four things coming in, right? And, say, some of them have like three possibilities and all that. So you 're thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible things numbers to enter,\ngrad d: And That's terrible.\ngrad c: right? So.\ngrad b: Some of them are completely absurd too, like they want to enter, but it's closed,\ngrad d: That's uh Well \ngrad b: it's night time, you know there are tourists and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you 're like \ngrad c: Yeah, the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect.\ngrad b: confused.\ngrad d: In which case you 're supposed to alert the authorities, and see appropriate action.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad c: Yeah. Yeah, another thing to do, um, is also to, um I guess to ask around people about other Bayes - net packages. Is Srini gonna be at the meeting tomorrow, do you know?\ngrad d: Maybe.\ngrad a: The day after tomorrow.\ngrad c: Wait \ngrad d: Quite possibly.\ngrad a: Wednesday.\ngrad c: Day after tomorrow.\ngrad d: Oh, oh, sorry.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Sorry, Wednesday,\ngrad b: Who's talking on Wednesday?\ngrad c: Maybe we can ask him about it.\ngrad d: yeah. Mmm.\ngrad b: I haven't J Jerry never sent out a sent out an email, did he, ever?\ngrad c: No. But he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking, I forget who.\ngrad a: Oh, isn't Ben?\ngrad c: Uh.\ngrad d: Ben?\ngrad a: Ben, then,\ngrad d: I think it's Ben actually,\ngrad a: Ben.\ngrad b: Ah!\ngrad d: yeah, um, giving his job talk I think. um, Sorry. I was just reading the screen.\ngrad a: OK.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad c: Oh.\ngrad a: So the uh That will be one one thing we could do. I actually uh, have Um, also we can uh, start looking at the SmartKom tables and I will \ngrad b: Right.\ngrad a: I actually wanted to show that to you guys now but um.\ngrad b: Do you want to trade?\ngrad a: Um, no I I actually made a mistake because it it fell asleep and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it's it doesn't wake up ever, so I had to reboot\ngrad d: Oh, no.\ngrad a: And if I reboot without a network, I will not be able to start SmartKom, because I need to have a network.\ngrad b: Uh \ngrad a: So we 'll do that t maybe uh \ngrad c: But. OK. But once you start sart start SmartKom you can be on You don't have to be on a network anymore. Is that the deal?\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad c: Ah, interesting.\ngrad b: Why does SmartKom need a network?\ngrad a: Um it looks up some stuff that, you know, is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a DHCP request, so it you know, my computer does not know its IP address, you know?\ngrad b: Ah.\ngrad a: You know. So. Unless it boots up with networking.\ngrad b: It's plugged in. Yeah.\ngrad a: And I don't have an IP address, they can't look up they don't know who localhost is, and so forth and so forth.\ngrad d: Hmm.\ngrad a: Always fun. But it's a, um, simple solution. We can just um, go downstairs and and and look at this, but maybe not today. The other thing um I will oh yeah, OK, I have to report um, data collection. We interviewed Fey,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: She's willing to do it, meaning be the wizard for the data collection, also maybe transcribe a little bit, if she has to, but also recruiting subjects, organizing them, and so forth. So that looks good. Jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her, see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous, eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard. And I talked to Liz about this and it looks as if Friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data.\ngrad c: So who would be the subject of this trial run?\ngrad a: Pardon me?\ngrad c: Who Will there be a Is one Is you one of you gonna be the subject? Like are you \ngrad a: Um Liz also volunteered to be the first subject, which I think might be even better than us guys.\ngrad d: Good.\ngrad b: One of us, yeah.\ngrad a: If we do need her for the technical stuff, then of course one of you has to sort of uh jump in.\ngrad b: I like how we 've you guys have successfully narrowed it down. \" Is one of you going to be the subject? \" Is one of you jump in.\ngrad d: Reference. I haven't done it yet.\ngrad c: Well I just figured it has to be someone who's, um, familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard, so we can, uh, see if they 're you know good.\ngrad d: Oh plants? e u someone who can plant difficult things.\ngrad c: Yeah. I mean that's what we wanna check, right?\ngrad a: Um,\ngrad d: Well, in this case it's a p it's a sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject.\ngrad c: Isn't that what it is?\ngrad d: It's uh \ngrad a: yes w we we would like to test the wizard, but you know, if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task, or any of the set up, we get a more realistic\ngrad c: I guess that would be reasonable.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad a: you know, set up as \ngrad b: Yeah. I know. That's probably a good enough test of \ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad c: Sort of having an actively antagonistic, uh \ngrad d: Yeah. That might be a little unfair. Um.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad d: I 'm sure if we uh, You think there's a chance we might need Liz for, whatever, the technical side of things? I 'm sure we can get other people around who don't know anything um, if we want another subject.\ngrad a: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad d: You know. Like I can drag Ben into it or something. Although he might cause problems but. So, is it a experimental setup for the um, data collection totally ready determined?\ngrad b: I like that. \" Test the wizard. \" I want that on a T - shirt.\ngrad a: Um I think it's it's it's I mean experimental setup u on the technical issue yes, except we st I think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard, just a tape recorder that's running in a room.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: But um in terms of specifying the scenario, um uh uh we 've gotten a little further\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: but um we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard, and have the wizard partake in the ultimate sort of definition probe. So so if if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and and we really like her, then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and getting all the details completely figured out.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: And um \ngrad d: OK. So the ideal task um, will have whatever I don't know how much the structure of the evolving Bayes - net will af affect Like we wanna we wanna be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that,\ngrad a: Mmm - yea - some.\ngrad d: right? in the course of the task? Well not all of them but you know.\ngrad a: Bu - e e e I 'm even This this Tango, Enter, Vista is sort of, itself, an ad - hoc scenario.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: The the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following. The data we get from Munich is very command line, simple linguistic stuff.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Hardly anything complicated. No metaphors whatsoever.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Not a rich language. So we wanted just to collect data, to get that that that elicits more, uh, that elicits richer language.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: And we actually did not want to constrain it too much,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: you know? Just see what people say. And then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve, you know, with whatever engine we we come up with. Um. So this this this is a parallel track, you know, there they hopefully meet,\ngrad d: OK. So in other words this data collection is more general.\ngrad a: but since \ngrad d: It could it could be used for not just this task.\ngrad a: It should tell us, you know, what kind of phenomenon could occur, it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: and the sort of differences there. So it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics, um, that no one knows anything about, as of yesterday. And uh nothing has changed since then, so. Uh. And secondly, now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this, and especially since um Johno can't stop Tango - ing, we may actually include, you know, those those intentions. So now I think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with with sort of explicit uh\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: not ex it's implicit that the person wants to enter,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: and maybe some task where it's more or less explicit that the person wants to take a picture,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: or see it or something. So that we can label it. I mean, that's how we get a corpus that we can label.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Exactly.\ngrad a: Whereas, you know, if we 'd just get data we 'd never know what they actually wanted, we 'd get no cues. Yep.\ngrad b: Alrighty.\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad a: That was that.\ngrad b: So is this the official end of the meeting now?\ngrad c: Yep.\ngrad d: Looks like it.\ngrad c: So what's \" Economics, the fallacy \"?\ngrad a: Ma\ngrad b: I just randomly label things. So that has nothing to do with economics or anything.\ngrad c: Oh, really?\ngrad a: Maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue.\ngrad c: OK.\ngrad d: OK.

But i you know, i we can Something Somebody can have discussed the admission fee and u the answer is s if we um, you know, um still, based on that result is never going to enter that building.\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad a: You know? Because it's just too expensive.\ngrad b: Oh yeah, I think I see. So the discourse refers to \" admission fee \" but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse.\ngrad d: Yeah. you have to have some notion of not just I mean there's a there's change across several turns of discourse\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: so I don't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh, other other discourse processing that might be happen.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: Yeah.  Yeah.\ngrad d: I mean.\ngrad b: What sort of discourse processing is uh are the How much is built into SmartKom and \ngrad a: It works like this. The uh, um I mean. The first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t They tried to figure out the intention, right? simply by parsing it. And this um m won't differentiate between all modes, yeah? but at least it 'll tell us \" OK here we have something that somebody that wants to go someplace, now it's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is  is happening, and um, if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed, what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it's handed on to the discourse history which is, um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules. It's it's actually the the whole memory of the entire system, that knows what wh who said what, which was what was presented. It helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted, so, um, because you say \" OK, how can I get to the castle? \" Oh, how how much is it? \" and um \" yeah I would like uh um to g let's do it \" and so forth. So even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened. so whenever the uh, um person is not actually rejecting what happened before, so as in \" No I really don't want to see that movie. I 'd rather stay home and watch TV \" um What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step, by the discourse model discourse model, Yeah, that's what it's called. and, um, it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues. So a person pointing to something on the screen, you know, the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad a: so it's a it's a rather huge huge thing but um  um  we can sort of It has a very clear interface. We can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad a: um which is a question. How deep do we want to sear, you know? Um but we should try to keep in mind that, you know, we 're doing this sort of for research, so we we should find a limit that's reasonable and not go, you know, all the way back to Adam and Eve. You know, did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life? And the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise and Anyway.\ngrad d: So one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of \" admission fee discussion \" as a cue for entry, is thinking about the plans that various people might have. Like all the different sort of general schemas that they might be following OK. This person is um, finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business. Um, because then anything that's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan. Um, I don't know. They 're in in non in sort of more traditional AI kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know, some idea at each turn of agent doing something, \" OK, wha what plans is this a consistent with? \" and then get s some more information and then you see \" here's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into \". It it might be useful here too.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: I I don't know how you know you 'd have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that.\ngrad a: I mean the u u\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad a: It's in the these these these plan schemas. I mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate, you know. \" What do you need need to buy a ticket? \"\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: You know? and it it's fifty steps,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: huh? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter, you know, and and maybe that's helpful to look at it to look at those. It's amazing what human beings can do. W when we talked uh we had the example, you know, of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands, says New York and you say Track seven, huh? And it's because you know that that person actually is following, you know You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps, you know, without any information other than \" New York \", huh? inferring everything from the context. So, works. Um, even though there is probably no train from here to New York, right?\ngrad d: Mmm. Not direct.\ngrad b: You 'd uh probably have to transfer in Chicago.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. But uh it's possible. Um, no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else. Right? Is that t San Francisco, Chicago?\ngrad b: I think \ngrad a: Is that possible?\ngrad b: One time I saw a report on trains, and I think there is a l I don't know if I thought there was a line that went from somewhere, maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad b: I could be wrong though.

So uh I also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail I think from uh  from OGI and we 'll go go through them also. So where are we on  on uh our runs?\nphd d: Uh so. uh We So As I was already said, we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features.\nprofessor b: Excuse me.\nphd d: The PLP, the PLP with JRASTA, the MSG, and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Uh, and we focused for the the test part on the English and the Italian. Um. We 've trained uh several neural networks on so on the TI - digits English and on the Italian data and also on the broad uh English uh French and uh Spanish databases. Mmm, so there's our result tables here, for the tandem approach, and um, actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well.\nprofessor b: OK. Our our uh  There's a  We 're pausing for a photo \nphd c: Chicken on the grill. Try that corner.\nphd a: How about over th from the front of the room?\nphd c: Yeah, it's longer.\nprofessor b: We 're pausing for a photo opportunity here. Uh. Uh. So.\ngrad f: Oh wait wait wait wait wait. Wait.\nphd c: Get out of the Yeah.\ngrad f: Hold on. Hold on.\nprofessor b: OK.\ngrad f: Let me give you a black screen.\nprofessor b: He's facing this way. What? OK, this this would be a good section for our silence detection.\ngrad f: OK.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Um Oh.\ngrad f: Musical chairs everybody!\nprofessor b: OK. So um, you were saying about the training data Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah, so if the network is trained on the task data um tandem works pretty well. And uh actually we have uh, results are similar Only on,\nphd a: Do you mean if it's trained only on On data from just that task,\nphd d: yeah.\nphd a: that language?\nphd d: Just that task. But actually we didn't train network on uh both types of data I mean uh phonetically ba phonetically balanced uh data and task data.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd d: We only did either task task data or uh broad data.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Um Yeah. So,\nprofessor b: So how I mean clearly it's gonna be good then\nphd a: So what's th\nprofessor b: but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data? I mean, my assump From what I saw from the earlier results, uh I guess last week, was that um, if you trained on one language and tested on another, say, that the results were were relatively poor.\nphd d: Mmm. Yeah.\nprofessor b: But but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another, does that  is that improve things i c in comparison?\nphd d: If we use the same language?\nprofessor b: No, no, no. Different lang So um If you train on TI - digits and test on Italian digits, you do poorly, let's say.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I don't have the numbers in front of me,\nphd d: But Yeah but I did not uh do that.\nprofessor b: so I 'm just imagining. E So, you didn't train on TIMIT and test on  on Italian digits, say?\nphd d: We No, we did four four kind of of testing, actually. The first testing is with task data So, with nets trained on task data. So for Italian on the Italian speech @ @. The second test is trained on a single language um with broad database, but the same language as the t task data.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: But for Italian we choose Spanish which we assume is close to Italian. The third test is by using, um the three language database\nprofessor b: W which in \nphd d: and the fourth is\nprofessor b: It has three languages. That's including the w the  the \nphd d: This includes \nprofessor b: the one that it's \nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: In\nphd d: But not digits. I mean it's \nphd a: The three languages is not digits,\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd a: it's the broad data. OK.\nphd d: Yeah And the fourth test is uh excluding from these three languages the language that is the task language.\nprofessor b: Oh, OK, yeah, so, that is what I wanted to know.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I just wasn't saying it very well, I guess.\nphd d: Uh, yeah. So um for uh TI - digits for ins example uh when we go from TI - digits training to TIMIT training uh we lose uh around ten percent, uh. The error rate increase u of of of ten percent, relative.\nprofessor b: Relative. Right.\nphd d: So this is not so bad. And then when we jump to the multilingual data it's uh it become worse and, well Around uh, let's say, twenty perc twenty percent further.\nprofessor b: Ab - about how much?\nphd d: So. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Twenty percent further?\nphd d: Twenty to to thirty percent further. Yeah.\nphd a: And so, remind me, the multilingual stuff is just the broad data. Right? It's not the digits.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: So it's the combination of two things there. It's removing the task specific training and it's adding other languages.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: OK.\nphd d: But the first step is al already removing the task s specific from from \nphd a: Already, right right right.\nphd d: So.\nphd a: So they were sort of building here?\nphd d: And we lose \nphd a: OK?\nphd d: Yeah. Uh So, basically when it's trained on the the multilingual broad data um or number so, the the ratio of our error rates uh with the baseline error rate is around uh one point one.\nprofessor b: Yes. And it's something like one point three of of the uh \nphd d: So.\nprofessor b: I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline, you get something like one point one for the for the using the same language but a different task, and something like one point three for three three languages broad stuff.\nphd d: No no no. Uh same language we are at uh for at English at O point eight. So it improves, compared to the baseline. But So. Le - let me.\nprofessor b: I I I 'm sorry.\nphd d: Tas - task data\nprofessor b: I I I meant something different by baseline\nphd d: we are u Yeah.\nprofessor b: So let me let me Um, so, um \nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: OK, fine. Let's let's use the conventional meaning of baseline.\nphd d: Hmm.\nprofessor b: I I By baseline here I meant uh using the task specific data.\nphd d: Oh yeah, the f Yeah, OK.\nprofessor b: But uh  uh, because that's what you were just doing with this ten percent.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So I was just I just trying to understand that.\nphd d: Yeah. Sure.\nprofessor b: So if we call a factor of w just one, just normalized to one, the word error rate that you have for using TI - digits as as training and TI - digits as test,\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: uh different words, I 'm sure,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but  but uh, uh the same task and so on.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: If we call that \" one \", then what you 're saying is that the word error rate for the same language but using uh different training data than you 're testing on, say TIMIT and so forth, it's one point one.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Yeah, it's around one point one.\nprofessor b: Right. And if it's \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: you do go to three languages including the English, it's something like one point three. That's what you were just saying, I think.\nphd d: Ye Uh, more actually.\nphd a: One point four?\nphd d: If I Yeah.\nphd a: So, it's an additional thirty percent.\nphd d: What would you say? Around one point four\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: yeah.\nprofessor b: And if you exclude English, from this combination, what's that?\nphd d: If we exclude English, um there is not much difference with the data with English.\nprofessor b: Aha!\nphd d: So. Yeah.\nprofessor b: That's interesting. That's interesting. Do you see? Because Uh,\nphd d: Uh.\nprofessor b: so No, that that's important. So what what it's saying here is just that \" yes, there is a reduction in performance, when you don't um have the s when you don't have um\nphd a: Task data.\nprofessor b: Wait a minute, th th the \nphd d: Hmm.\nprofessor b: No, actually it's interesting. So it's So when you go to a different task, there's actually not so different. It's when you went to these So what's the difference between two and three? Between the one point one case and the one point four case? I 'm confused.\nphd a: It's multilingual.\nphd d: Yeah. The only difference it's is that it's multilingual Um\nprofessor b: Cuz in both in both both of those cases, you don't have the same task.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah sure.\nprofessor b: So is is the training data for the for this one point four case does it include the training data for the one point one case?\nphd d: Uh yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, a fraction of it.\nphd d: A part of it, yeah.\nprofessor b: How m how much bigger is it?\nphd d: Um It's two times,\ngrad f: Yeah, um.\nphd d: actually? Yeah. Um. The English data  No, the multilingual databases are two times the broad English data. We just wanted to keep this, w well, not too huge. So.\nprofessor b: So it's two times, but it includes the but it includes the broad English data.\nphd d: I think so. Do you Uh, Yeah.\nprofessor b: And the broad English data is what you got this one point one with. So that's TIMIT basically right?\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So it's band - limited TIMIT. This is all eight kilohertz sampling.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad f: Downs Right.\nprofessor b: So you have band - limited TIMIT, gave you uh almost as good as a result as using TI - digits on a TI - digits test. OK?\nphd d: Hmm?\nprofessor b: Um and um But, when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size, it um performs worse on the TI - digits. OK, now all of this is  This is noisy TI - digits, I assume? Both training and test?\nphd d: \nprofessor b: Yeah. OK. Um OK. Well. We we we may just need to uh So I mean it's interesting that h going to a different different task didn't seem to hurt us that much, and going to a different language um It doesn't seem to matter The difference between three and four is not particularly great, so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: It sounds like um uh we may need to have more of uh things that are similar to a target language or I mean. You have the same number of parameters in the neural net, you haven't increased the size of the neural net, and maybe there's just  just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set. That that could be. Um So, what about So these are results with uh th that you 're describing now, that they are pretty similar for the different features or  or uh \nphd d: Uh, let me check. Uh.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: So. This was for the PLP,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Um. The Yeah. For the PLP with JRASTA the  the we This is quite the same tendency, with a slight increase of the error rate, uh if we go to to TIMIT. And then it's it gets worse with the multilingual. Um. Yeah. There there is a difference actually with b between PLP and JRASTA is that JRASTA seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition. Mmm.\nprofessor b: I have a suggestion, actually, even though it 'll delay us slightly, would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this? Cuz we 're all sort of If we c if we could look at it, while we 're talking, I think it 'd be\nphd d: Yeah, yeah. OK.\nprofessor b: uh  Uh, I 'll I 'll sing a song or dance or something while you do it, too.\nphd a: So um \ngrad f: Alright.\nphd a: Go ahead. Ah, while you 're gone I 'll ask s some of my questions.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Uh, this way and just slightly to the left, yeah.\nphd a: The um What was Was this number forty or It was roughly the same as this one, he said? When you had the two language versus the three language?\nprofessor b: Um. That's what he was saying.\nphd a: That's where he removed English,\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: right?\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad f: It sometimes, actually, depends on what features you 're using.\nprofessor b: Yeah. But but i it sounds like \ngrad f: Um, but He Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean. That's interesting because it it seems like what it's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh didn't have so much representation of English, because in the other case you don't get hurt any more, at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but you have the same number of parameters representing it.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. I wonder were um all three of these nets using the same output? This multi - language uh labelling?\ngrad f: He was using uh sixty - four phonemes from SAMPA.\nphd a: OK, OK.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: So this would  From this you would say, \" well, it doesn't really matter if we put Finnish into the training of the neural net, if there's gonna be, you know, Finnish in the test data. \" Right?\nprofessor b: Well, it's it sounds  I mean, we have to be careful, cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And comparing different bad results can be tricky.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: But I I I  I think it does suggest that it's not so much uh uh cross language as cross type of speech.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: It's it's um But we did Oh yeah, the other thing I was asking him, though, is that I think that in the case Yeah, you you do have to be careful because of com compounded results. I think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you didn't have three, but you just had one language. So you trained on one type of digits and tested on another. Didn - Wasn't there something of that? Where you, say, trained on Spanish and tested on on TI - digits, or the other way around? Something like that?\nphd e: No.\nprofessor b: I thought there was something like that, that he showed me last week. We 'll have to wait till we get \nphd a: Yeah, that would be interesting.\nprofessor b: Um, This may have been what I was asking before, Stephane, but  but, um, wasn't there something that you did, where you trained on one language and tested on another? I mean no no mixture but just \ngrad f: I 'll get it for you.\nphd d: Uh, no, no.\nprofessor b: We 've never just trained on one lang\nphd d: Training on a single language, you mean, and testing on the other one?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Uh, no.\nphd e: Not yet.\nphd d: So the only task that's similar to this is the training on two languages, and that \nprofessor b: But we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language. Right? I mean, you haven't you haven't done all your tests on multiple languages.\nphd d: Uh, No. Either thi this is test with uh the same language but from the broad data, or it's test with uh different languages also from the broad data, excluding the So, it's it's three or three and four.\nphd e: The early experiment that \nphd a: Did you do different languages from digits?\nphd d: Uh. No. You mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other?\nphd a: Digits on another language?\nphd d: No.\nprofessor b: See, I thought you showed me something like that last week. You had a you had a little \nphd d: Uh, No, I don't think so.\nprofessor b: Um What \nphd c: These numbers are uh ratio to baseline?\nprofessor b: So, I mean wha what's the \nphd d: So.\nprofessor b: This this chart this table that we 're looking at is um, show is all testing for TI - digits, or?\ngrad f: Bigger is worse.\nphd d: So you have uh basically two uh parts.\ngrad f: This is error rate, I think.\nphd c: Ratio.\ngrad f: No. No.\nphd d: The upper part is for TI - digits\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nphd d: and it's divided in three rows of four four rows each.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: And the first four rows is well - matched, then the s the second group of four rows is mismatched, and finally highly mismatched. And then the lower part is for Italian and it's the same  the same thing.\nphd a: So, so the upper part is training TI - digits?\nphd d: So. It's it's the HTK results, I mean. So it's HTK training testings with different kind of features\nphd a: Ah.\nphd d: and what appears in the uh left column is the networks that are used for doing this.\nprofessor b: Hmm.\nphd d: So. Uh Yeah.\nprofessor b: Well, What was is that i What was it that you had done last week when you showed Do you remember? Wh - when you showed me the your table last week?\nphd d: It - It was part of these results. Mmm. Mmm.\nphd a: So where is the baseline for the TI - digits located in here?\nphd d: You mean the HTK Aurora baseline?\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: It's uh the one hundred number. It's, well, all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline.\nphd a: Ah! Ah, OK, OK.\nprofessor b: So this is word word error rate, so a high number is bad.\nphd d: Yeah, this is a word error rate ratio.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd a: OK, I see.\nphd d: Yeah. So, seventy point two means that we reduced the error rate uh by thirty thirty percent.\nphd a: OK, OK, gotcha.\nphd d: So.\nprofessor b: OK, so if we take\nphd d: Hmm.\nprofessor b: uh um let's see PLP uh with on - line normalization and delta - del so that's this thing you have circled here in the second column,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: um and \" multi - English \" refers to what?\nphd d: To TIMIT. Mmm. Then you have uh MF, MS and ME which are for French, Spanish and English. And, yeah. Actually I  I uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh features without the s derivatives uh but with increased frame numbers. Mmm. And we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it  it's slightly slightly worse when we don't use delta but it's not  not that much.\nprofessor b: Right. So w w So, I 'm sorry. I missed that. What's MF, MS and ME?\nphd a: Multi - French, Multi - Spanish\nphd d: So. Multi - French, Multi - Spanish, and Multi - English.\nprofessor b: Uh OK. So, it's uh broader vocabulary. Then And \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK so I think what I 'm what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was was there were some numbers I saw, I think, that included these multiple languages and it and I was seeing that it got worse. I I think that was all it was. You had some very limited results that at that point\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: which showed having in these these other languages. In fact it might have been just this last category, having two languages broad that were where where English was removed. So that was cross language and the and the result was quite poor. What I  we hadn't seen yet was that if you added in the English, it's still poor.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh Um now, what's the noise condition um of the training data \nphd d: Still poor.\nprofessor b: Well, I think this is what you were explaining. The noise condition is the same It's the same uh Aurora noises uh, in all these cases for the training.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor b: So there's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test\nphd d: No these are the s s s same noises,\nprofessor b: and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect \nphd d: yeah. At least at least for the first  for the well - matched,\ngrad f: Well matched condition.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: yeah.\nprofessor b: So there's some kind of a a an effect from having these uh this broader coverage um Now I guess what we should try doing with this is try testing these on u this same sort of thing on you probably must have this lined up to do. To try the same t with the exact same training, do testing on the other languages.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: On on um So. Um, oh I well, wait a minute. You have this here, for the Italian. That's right. OK, so, So.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah, so for the Italian the results are uh stranger um Mmm. So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is not very close to Italian because uh, well, when using the the network trained only on Spanish it's  the error rate is almost uh twice the baseline error rate.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Mmm. Uh.\nprofessor b: Well, I mean, let's see. Is there any difference in So it's in the uh So you 're saying that when you train on English and uh and and test on \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: No, you don't have training on English testing \nphd d: There there is another difference, is that the noise the noises are different.\nprofessor b: In in what?\nphd d: Well, For for the Italian part I mean the uh the um networks are trained with noise from Aurora TI - digits,\nphd e: Aurora - two.\nphd d: mmm.\nprofessor b: And the noise is different in th\nphd d: Yeah. And perhaps the noise are quite different from the noises in the speech that Italian.\nprofessor b: Do we have any um test sets uh in any other language that um have the same noise as in the Aurora?\nphd d: And \nphd e: Mmm, no.\nphd d: No.\nphd a: Can I ask something real quick? In in the upper part  in the English stuff, it looks like the very best number is sixty point nine? and that's in the uh  the third section in the upper part under PLP JRASTA, sort of the middle column?\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: I is that a noisy condition?\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: So that's matched training? Is that what that is?\nphd d: It's no, the third part, so it's uh highly mismatched. So. Training and test noise are different.\nphd a: So why do you get your best number in Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case?\nphd c: Well, it's relative to the um baseline mismatching\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Ah,\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: OK so these are not OK, alright, I see.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: OK. And then so, in the in the um  in the non - mismatched clean case, your best one was under MFCC? That sixty - one point four?\nphd d: Yeah. But it's not a clean case. It's a noisy case but uh training and test noises are the same.\nphd a: Oh! So this upper third?\nphd d: So Yeah.\nphd a: Uh that's still noisy?\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Ah, OK.\nphd d: So it's always noisy basically,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: and, well, the \nphd a: I see.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: OK? Um So uh, I think this will take some looking at, thinking about. But, what is uh what is currently running, that's uh, i that just filling in the holes here or or?  pretty much?\nphd d: Uh, no we don't plan to fill the holes\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: but actually there is something important, is that um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using was not uh leading to very good results when we used the straight features to HTK. Um  Mmm. So basically d if you look at the at the left of the table, the first uh row, with eighty - six, one hundred, and forty - three and seventy - five, these are the results we obtained for Italian uh with straight mmm, PLP features using on - line normalization.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Mmm. And the, mmm what's in the table, just at the left of the PLP twelve on - line normalization column, so, the numbers seventy - nine, fifty - four and uh forty - two are the results obtained by uh Pratibha with uh his on - line normalization uh her on - line normalization approach.\nphd a: Where is that? seventy - nine, fifty\nprofessor b: Uh, it's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line.\nphd d: So.\nphd e: Fifty - one? This \nphd a: Oh I see, OK.\nprofessor b: Uh. Yeah.\nphd d: Just uh Yeah. So these are the results of OGI with on - line normalization and straight features to HTK. And the previous result, eighty - six and so on, are with our features straight to HTK.\nprofessor b: Yes. Yes.\nphd d: So what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct, but still the networks are very good. When we use the networks our number are better that uh Pratibha results.\nphd e: We improve.\nprofessor b: So, do you know what was wrong with the on - line normalization, or?\nphd d: Yeah. There were diff there were different things and basically, the first thing is the mmm, alpha uh value. So, the recursion uh part. um, I used point five percent, which was the default value in the  in the programs here. And Pratibha used five percent.\nprofessor b: Uh\nphd d: So it adapts more quickly\nprofessor b: Yes. Yeah.\nphd d: Um, but, yeah. I assume that this was not important because uh previous results from from Dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same uh results. It was true on uh TI - digits but it's not true on Italian.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Uh, second thing is the initialization of the stuff. Actually, uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance. And using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database.\nprofessor b: Right. Right.\nphd d: And Pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance. Mmm. There were other minor differences, the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen, and that she used C - zero instead of log energy. Uh, but the main differences concerns the recursion. So. Uh, I changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that's similar to the OGI baseline.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: We It it's slightly uh different because I don't exactly initialize the same way she does. Actually I start, mmm, I don't wait to a fifteen twenty - five twenty - five frames before computing a mean and the variance to e to to start the recursion.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: I I use the on - line scheme and only start the re recursion after the twenty - five  twenty - fifth frame. But, well it's similar. So uh I retrained the networks with these well, the the the networks are retaining with these new features.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And, yeah.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: So basically what I expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: because I think the neural networks learn perhaps to \nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: even if the features are not normalized. It it will learn how to normalize and \nprofessor b: OK, but I think that given the pressure of time we probably want to draw because of that especially, we wanna draw some conclusions from this, do some reductions in what we 're looking at,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and make some strong decisions for what we 're gonna do testing on before next week. So do you are you w did you have something going on, on the side, with uh multi - band or on on this,\nphd d: Yeah I\nprofessor b: or?\nphd d: No, I we plan to start this uh so, act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um, these what we could do more as a as a research and  and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not Uh, well, there is basically perhaps a flaw in the in the the stuff because we trained the networks If we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: um, what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space.\nprofessor b: Mmm.\nphd d: And uh mmm and ask the network to put one, at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side. And so there is kind of reduction of the information there that's not correct because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task, obviously the decision boundaries are not  should not be at the same place.\nprofessor b: I di\nphd d: But the way the feature gives The the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the  it removes completely the information  a lot of information from the the features by uh uh placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data but this is not the case for another kind of data.\nprofessor b: It's a trade - off,\nphd d: So \nprofessor b: right? Any - anyway go ahead.\nphd d: Yeah. So uh what we were thinking about is perhaps um one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks. Doing something like, um um phonemes within context and, well, basically context dependent phonemes.\nprofessor b: Maybe. I mean, I I think you could make the same argument, it 'd be just as legitimate, for hybrid systems as well. Right.\nphd d: Yeah but, we know that \nprofessor b: And in fact, th things get better with context dependent versions. Right?\nphd d: Ye - yeah but here it's something different. We want to have features\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: uh well, um.\nprofessor b: Yeah, but it's still true that what you 're doing is you 're ignoring you 're you 're coming up with something to represent, whether it's a distribution, probability distribution or features, you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing uh, things that vary w over context.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh, and you 're putting it all together, ignoring the differences in context. That that's true for the hybrid system, it's true for a tandem system. So, for that reason, when you in in in a hybrid system, when you incorporate context one way or another, you do get better scores.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK? But I it's it's a big deal to get that. I I 'm I 'm sort of And once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language. So um Uh, the  the acoustics associated with uh a particular context, for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other, so the qu the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder. We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data um\nphd d: Yeah, but mmm, I mean, the the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: And uh binary decisions about phonemes. Nnn Uh It's \nprofessor b: Almost. But I mean it it it does give a distribution.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: It's and and it is true that if there's two phones that are very similar, that uh the  i it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other, too.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah, sure but uh So basically it's almost binary decisions and um the idea of using more classes is to get something that's less binary decisions.\nprofessor b: Oh no, but it would still be even more of a binary decision. It it 'd be even more of one. Because then you would say that in that this phone in this context is a one, but the same phone in a slightly different context is a zero.\nphd d: But yeah, but \nprofessor b: That would be even even more distinct of a binary decision. I actually would have thought you 'd wanna go the other way and have fewer classes.\nphd d: Yeah, but if \nprofessor b: Uh, I mean for instance, the the thing I was arguing for before, but again which I don't think we have time to try, is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several outputs on and use articulatory features\nphd d: Mmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: cuz then that would that would go  that would be much broader and cover many different situations. But if you go to very very fine categories, it's very binary.\nphd d: Mmm. Yeah, but I think Yeah, perhaps you 're right, but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features. So, Um You have more information in the uh\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm. True.\nphd d: posteriors vector um which means that But still the information is relevant\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: because it's it's information that helps to discriminate,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: if it's possible to be able to discriminate among the phonemes in context.\nprofessor b: Well it's it's  it's an interesting thought.\nphd d: But the \nprofessor b: I mean we we could disagree about it at length\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: and  and we 'll see. But but what I 'm more concerned with now, as an operational level, is uh, you know,\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: what do we do in four or five days? Uh, and  so we have to be concerned with Are we gonna look at any combinations of things, you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: Um, are we going to look at multi - band? Are we gonna look at combinations of things? Uh, what questions are we gonna ask, uh now that, I mean, we should probably turn shortly to this O G I note. Um, how are we going to combine with what they 've been focusing on? Uh, Uh we haven't been doing any of the L D A RASTA sort of thing.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And they, although they don't talk about it in this note, um, there's um, the issue of the um Mu law business uh versus the logarithm, um, so.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So what i what is going on right now? What's right you 've got nets retraining, Are there is there are there any H T K trainings testings going on?\nphd d: N\nphd e: I I I 'm trying the HTK with eh, PLP twelve on - line delta - delta and MSG filter together.\nprofessor b: The combination, I see.\nphd e: The combination, yeah. But I haven't result at this moment.\nprofessor b: MSG and and PLP.\nphd e: Yeah. \nprofessor b: And is this with the revised on - line normalization?\nphd e: Ye - Uh, with the old older,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Old one. So it's using all the nets for that\nphd e: yeah.\nprofessor b: but again we have the hope that it  We have the hope that it  maybe it's not making too much difference,\nphd e: Yeah. But We can know soon.\nprofessor b: but but\nphd e: Maybe.\nprofessor b: yeah.\nphd e: I don't know.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh, OK.\nphd d: Uh so there is this combination, yeah. Working on combination obviously.\nphd e: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Um, I will start work on multi - band. And we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs.\nphd e: \nphd d: Um. And we think that with this approach perhaps we could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network. Um, So, get simpler networks, because we still have the features. So we have um come up with um different kind of broad phonetic categories. And we have Basically we have three types of broad phonetic classes. Well, something using place of articulation which which leads to nine, I think, broad classes. Uh, another which is based on manner, which is is also something like nine classes. And then, something that combine both, and we have twenty f twenty - five?\ngrad f: Twenty - seven.\nphd d: Twenty - seven broad classes. So like, uh, oh, I don't know, like back vowels, front vowels.\nprofessor b: So what you do um I just wanna understand\nphd d: Um For the moments we do not don't have nets,\nprofessor b: so You have two net or three nets? Was this? How many how many nets do you have? No nets.\nphd d: I mean, It's just Were we just changing the labels to retrain nets with fewer out outputs.\nphd e: Begin to work in this. We are @ @.\nprofessor b: Right. But but I didn't understand \nphd d: And then Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh. the software currently just has uh a allows for I think, the one one hot output. So you 're having multiple nets and combining them, or? Uh, how are you how are you coming up with If you say uh If you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic, how do you \nphd d: It - It's the single net,\nphd a: I think they have one output.\nphd d: yeah.\nprofessor b: Oh, it's just one net.\nphd d: It's one net with um twenty - seven outputs\nphd e: Yeah.\ngrad f: mm - hmm\nphd d: if we have twenty - seven classes,\nprofessor b: I see. I see, OK.\nphd d: yeah. So it's Well, it's basically a standard net with fewer classes.\nprofessor b: So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of yeah.\nphd d: Yeah, but I think Yeah. B b including the features, yeah.\ngrad f: But including the features.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd d: I don't think this will work alone. I think it will get worse because Well, I believe the effect that of of too reducing too much the information is basically basically what happens\nprofessor b: Uh - huh.\nphd d: and \nprofessor b: But you think if you include that plus the other features,\nphd d: but Yeah, because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings, and OGI show showed that, is the distinction between sp speech and silence Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition. I mean the labels are obtained on clean speech, and we add noise after. So this is one thing And But perhaps, something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information. Uh.\nprofessor b: So so again then we have these broad classes and well, somewhat broad. I mean, it's twenty - seven instead of sixty - four, basically. And you have the original features.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Which are PLP, or something.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And then uh, just to remind me, all of that goes into uh, that all of that is transformed by uh, uh, K - KL or something, or?\nphd d: Mm - hmm. There will probably be,\nphd e: Mu.\nphd d: yeah, one single KL to transform everything\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: or uh,\nphd e: No transform the PLP\nphd d: per\nphd e: and only transform the other I 'm not sure.\nprofessor b: Well no,\nphd d: This is still something that\nprofessor b: I think I see.\nphd d: yeah, we don't know \nprofessor b: So there's a question of whether you would \nphd e: Two e @ @ it's one.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Right. Whether you would transform together or just one. Yeah. Might wanna try it both ways. But that's interesting. So that's something that you 're you haven't trained yet but are preparing to train, and \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Um  Yeah, so I think Hynek will be here Monday.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: Monday or Tuesday. So\nphd d: Uh, yeah.\nprofessor b: So I think, you know, we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully, so we can get uh key  key questions answered uh before then\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace, uh uh, it's it's really time to  time to choose.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Um, let me pass this out, by the way. Um These are Did did  did I interrupt you?\nphd e: Yeah, I have one.\nprofessor b: Were there other things that you wanted to \nphd d: Uh, no. I don't think so.\nphd e: \nphd d: Yeah, I have one.\ngrad g: Oh, thanks.\nprofessor b: Ah! OK. OK, we have lots of them.\nphd e: We have one. \nprofessor b: OK, so um, Something I asked So they 're they 're doing the the VAD I guess they mean voice activity detection So again, it's the silence So they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs, I believe. Um I asked uh Hynek whether I haven't talked to Sunil I asked Hynek whether they compared that to just taking the nets we already had and summing up the probabilities.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh. To get the speech voice activity detection, or else just using the silence, if there's only one silence output. Um And, he didn't think they had, um. But on the other hand, maybe they can get by with a smaller net and maybe sometimes you don't run the other, maybe there's a computational advantage to having a separate net, anyway.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So um Their uh  the results look pretty good. Um, I mean, not uniformly.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean, there's a an example or two that you can find, where it made it slightly worse, but uh in in all but a couple examples.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd e: But they have a question of the result. Um how are trained the the LDA filter? How obtained the LDA filter?\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: I I 'm sorry. I don't understand your question.\nphd e: Yes, um the LDA filter needs some training set to obtain the filter. Maybe I don't know exactly how they are obtained.\nprofessor b: It's on training.\nphd e: Training, with the training test of each You understand me?\nprofessor b: No.\nphd e: Yeah, uh for example, LDA filter need a set of  a set of training to obtain the filter.\nprofessor b: Yes.\nphd e: And maybe for the Italian, for the TD TE on for Finnish, these filter are are obtained with their own training set.\nprofessor b: Yes, I don't know. That's that's so that's a that's a very good question, then now that it  I understand it. It's \" yeah, where does the LDA come from? \" In the In earlier experiments, they had taken LDA from a completely different database, right?\nphd e: Yeah. Yeah, because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd e: set.\nprofessor b: So that's a good question. Where does it come from? Yeah, I don't know. Um, but uh to tell you the truth, I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I I was looking at it I was mostly thinking about the  the VAD. And um, it ap it ap Oh what does what does ASP? Oh that's \nphd d: The features, yeah. Yeah.\nphd e: I don't understand also\nprofessor b: It says \" baseline ASP \".\nphd e: what is  what is the difference between ASP and uh baseline over?\nphd c: ASP.\nphd d: Yeah, I don't know.\nphd e: This is \nprofessor b: Anybody know any \nphd c: Oh. There it is.\nprofessor b: Um Cuz there's \" baseline Aurora \" above it.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And it's This is mostly better than baseline, although in some cases it's a little worse, in a couple cases.\nphd c: Well, it says baseline ASP is twenty - three mill minus thirteen.\nphd e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah, it says what it is. But I don't how that's different from \nphd c: From the baseline. OK.\nprofessor b: I think this was  I think this is the same point we were at when when we were up in Oregon.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd d: I think  I think it's the C - zero using C - zero instead of log energy.\nphd e: Ah, OK, mm - hmm.\nphd d: Yeah, it's this.\nprofessor b: Oh. OK.\nphd e: yeah.\nphd d: It should be that, yeah.\nphd a: They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature.\nprofessor b: Shouldn't it be \nphd d: Because \nphd a: Does does anybody know how they 're using it?\nprofessor b: Yeah. So so what they 're doing here is, i\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: if you look down at the block diagram, um, they estimate they get a  they get an estimate of whether it's speech or silence,\nphd a: But that \nprofessor b: and then they have a median filter of it.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And so um, basically they 're trying to find stretches. The median filter is enforcing a i it having some continuity.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: You find stretches where the combination of the frame wise VAD and the  the median filter say that there's a stretch of silence. And then it's going through and just throwing the data away.\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor b: Right? So um \nphd a: So it's it's I don't understand. You mean it's throwing out frames? Before \nprofessor b: It's throwing out chunks of frames, yeah. There's the the median filter is enforcing that it's not gonna be single cases of frames, or isolated frames.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So it's throwing out frames and the thing is um, what I don't understand is how they 're doing this with H T\nphd a: Yeah, that's what I was just gonna ask.\nprofessor b: This is \nphd a: How can you just throw out frames?\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well, you you can,\nphd d: i\nprofessor b: right? I mean y you you \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: it stretches again. For single frames I think it would be pretty hard.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: But if you say speech starts here, speech ends there.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Right?\nphd c: Huh.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah, you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah, so I mean in the i i in the in the decoding, you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here.\nphd d: I t\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I think they 're they 're they 're treating it, you know, like uh well, it's not isolated word, but but connected, you know, the the \nphd a: In the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of. So that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet.\nprofessor b: Well. No they they have numbers though, right? So I think they 're they 're doing something like that. I think that they 're they 're I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that's plausible for the standard. In other words, it's uh I mean from the point of view of of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah. I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this.\nprofessor b: Um. But it's the thing is it's that that that's that's I I Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice, uh uh for listening to, is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Right? And so um\nphd a: Plus it's gonna introduce delays.\nprofessor b: It does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it's it's within the  the boundaries of it.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor b: And the LDA introduces delays, and b what he's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it doesn't introduce uh, any more delay. I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the LDA down here I don't know Wh what's the difference between TLDA and SLDA?\nphd c: Temporal and spectral.\nprofessor b: Ah, thank you.\nphd e: Temporal LDA.\nprofessor b: Yeah, you would know that.\nphd c: Yeah\nprofessor b: So um. The temporal LDA does in fact include the same so that I think he well, by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way, this this delay would work in that way\nphd a: Ah.\nprofessor b: and then it 'd be OK. They they clearly did actually remove silent sections in order because they got these word error rate results. So um I think that it's it's nice to do that in this because in fact, it's gonna give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation. Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard, I don't know. Um. Uh, as you know, part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants  has has approached improving them. So it's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with. So this might just be a temporary thing. But But, on the other hand, and maybe maybe it's a decent idea. So um The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been if you look at what we 've been trying, we 're uh looking at uh, by then I guess, combinations of features and multi - band Uh, and we 've been looking at cross - language, cross task issues. And they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues. But they 've been looking at uh  at these issues. At the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection. And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that, how do we split up the effort? Uh, because we still have even once we choose, we 've still got uh another month or so, I mean there's holidays in the way, but but uh I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there's still a fair amount of time to do things together it's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time.\nphd a: When they removed the silence frames, did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it's  knows when it's time to back trace or something?\nprofessor b: Well, see they, I I think they 're Um. I don't know the  the specifics of how they 're doing it. They 're  they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to um, change the scripts for the recognizer, I believe.\nphd a: Oh, right. Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something?\nprofessor b: So. Uh. Uh, you know that's what I had thought. But I don't I don't think they are.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean that's sort of what the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side, yeah you p put some low level noise or something. Probably don't want all zeros.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: Most recognizers don't like zeros but but you know, put some epsilon in or some rand\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: sorry epsilon random variable in or something.\nphd a: Some constant vector. I mean i w Or something \nprofessor b: Maybe not a constant but it doesn't, uh don't like to divide by the variance of that, but I mean it's\nphd a: That's right. But something that what I mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So that the the silence model in HTK will always pick it up.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So I I that's what I thought they would do. or else, uh uh maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop, I don't know.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: But whatever they did, I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: We c we can find out.\nphd a: Cuz you gotta do something. Otherwise, if it's just a bunch of speech, stuck together \nprofessor b: No they 're \nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: It would do badly\nphd a: Yeah, right.\nprofessor b: and it didn't so badly, right? So they did something.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Uh. So, OK, So I think this brings me up to date a bit. It hopefully brings other people up to date a bit. And um Um I think Uh, I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit and think about it and  and talk with everybody uh, outside of this meeting. Um, but uh No I mean it sounds like I mean there there there are the usual number of of little little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out. And now we 're seem to be kind of in a position to actually uh, look at stuff and and and compare things. So I think that's that's pretty good. Um I don't know what the One of the things I wonder about, coming back to the first results you talked about, is is how much, uh things could be helped by more parameters. And uh  And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have, in terms of the uh computational limits. Because anyway when we go to twice as much data and have the same number of parameters, particularly when it's twice as much data and it's quite diverse, um, I wonder if having twice as many parameters would help.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh, just have a bigger hidden layer. Uh But I doubt it would help by forty per cent. But but uh\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Just curious. How are we doing on the resources? Disk, and \nphd d: I think we 're alright,\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: um, not much problems with that.\nprofessor b: Computation?\nphd d: It's OK.\nprofessor b: We \nphd d: Well this table took uh more than five days to get back.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah, well.\nphd d: But Yeah.\nprofessor b: Are were you folks using Gin? That's a that just died, you know?\nphd d: Mmm, no. You were using Gin perhaps, yeah? No.\nphd e: No.\nprofessor b: No? Oh, that's good.\ngrad f: It just died.\nprofessor b: OK. Yeah, we 're gonna get a replacement server that 'll be a faster server, actually.\nphd e: Yes.\nprofessor b: That 'll be It's a seven hundred fifty megahertz uh SUN\nphd d: Hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: uh But it won't be installed for a little while.\nphd c: Tonic.\nprofessor b: U Go ahead.\ngrad g: Do we Do we have that big new IBM machine the, I think in th\nprofessor b: We have the little tiny IBM machine that might someday grow up to be a big IBM machine. It's got s slots for eight, uh IBM was donating five, I think we only got two so far, processors. We had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors. They ended up being five fifty. So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz, we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz. And more are supposed to come soon and there's only a moderate amount of dat of memory. So I don't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it, but uh Hopefully, they 'll get us some more parts, soon and Uh, yeah, I think that 'll be once we get it populated, that 'll be a nice machine. I mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there. And uh and uh a nice amount of memory. Uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast Linux machine.\ngrad g: And if we can do things on Linux, some of the machines we have going already, like Swede?\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Um It seems pretty fast.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: But I think Fudge is pretty fast too.\nprofessor b: Yeah, I mean you can check with uh Dave Johnson. I mean, it it's  I think the machine is just sitting there. And it does have two processors, you know and  Somebody could do  you know, uh, check out uh the multi - threading libraries. And I mean i it's possible that the I mean, I guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on  on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there aren't five or eight. There's there's there's gonna be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight, to have it really be useful. But. Notice how I said somebody and turned my head your direction. That's one thing you don't get in these recordings. You don't get the  don't get the visuals but \ngrad g: I is it um mostly um the neural network trainings that are um slowing us down or the HTK runs that are slowing us down?\nprofessor b: Uh, I think yes. Uh, Isn't that right? I mean I think you 're you 're sort of held up by both, right? If the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything running through these a hundred times faster because you 'd be stuck by the HTK trainings,\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: right?\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: But if the HTK I mean I think they 're both It sounded like they were roughly equal? Is that about right?\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad g: Because, um I think that 'll be running Linux, and Sw - Swede and Fudge are already running Linux so, um I could try to get um the train the neural network trainings or the HTK stuff running under Linux, and to start with I 'm wondering which one I should pick first.\nprofessor b: Uh, probably the neural net cuz it's probably it it's  it's um Well, I I don't know. They both HTK we use for um this Aurora stuff Um Um, I think It's not clear yet what we 're gonna use for trainings uh Well, there's the trainings uh is it the training that takes the time, or the decoding? Uh, is it about equal between the two? For for Aurora?\nphd d: For HTK?\nprofessor b: For Yeah. For the Aurora?\nphd d: Uh Training is longer.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK. Well, I don't know how we can I don't know how to Do we have HTK source? Is that Yeah.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: You would think that would fairly trivially the training would, anyway, th the testing uh I don't I don't think would parallelize all that well. But I think that you could certainly do d um, distributed, sort of  Ah, no, it's the  each individual sentence is pretty tricky to parallelize. But you could split up the sentences in a test set.\nphd a: They have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile, in H T And you can parallelize the training.\nprofessor b: Yeah?\nphd a: And run it on several machines\nprofessor b: Aha!\nphd a: and it just basically keeps counts. And there's something  a final thing that you run and it accumulates all the counts together.\nprofessor b: I see.\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd a: I don't what their scripts are set up to do for the Aurora stuff, but \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than this Aurora stuff, uh what do we do, large vocabulary training slash testing for uh tandem systems. Cuz we hadn't really done much with tandem systems for larger stuff. Cuz we had this one collaboration with CMU and we used SPHINX. Uh, we 're also gonna be collaborating with SRI and we have their have theirs. Um So I don't know Um. So I I think the the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we 're gonna use the neural net trainings, no matter what, for a lot of the things we 're doing,\ngrad g: OK.\nprofessor b: whereas, w exactly which HMM Gaussian - mixture - based HMM thing we use is gonna depend uh So with that, maybe we should uh go to our digit recitation task. And, it's about eleven fifty. Canned. Uh, I can I can start over here. Great, uh, could you give Adam a call. Tell him to He's at two nine seven seven.\ngrad f: Oh.\nprofessor b: OK. I think we can @ @ You know Herve's coming tomorrow, right? Herve will be giving a talk, yeah, talk at eleven.

Uh, this way and just slightly to the left, yeah.\nphd a: The um What was Was this number forty or It was roughly the same as this one, he said? When you had the two language versus the three language?\nprofessor b: Um. That's what he was saying.\nphd a: That's where he removed English,\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: right?\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad f: It sometimes, actually, depends on what features you 're using.\nprofessor b: Yeah. But but i it sounds like \ngrad f: Um, but He Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean. That's interesting because it it seems like what it's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh didn't have so much representation of English, because in the other case you don't get hurt any more, at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but you have the same number of parameters representing it.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. I wonder were um all three of these nets using the same output? This multi - language uh labelling?\ngrad f: He was using uh sixty - four phonemes from SAMPA.\nphd a: OK, OK.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: So this would  From this you would say, \" well, it doesn't really matter if we put Finnish into the training of the neural net, if there's gonna be, you know, Finnish in the test data. \" Right?\nprofessor b: Well, it's it sounds  I mean, we have to be careful, cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And comparing different bad results can be tricky.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: But I I I  I think it does suggest that it's not so much uh uh cross language as cross type of speech.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: It's it's um But we did Oh yeah, the other thing I was asking him, though, is that I think that in the case Yeah, you you do have to be careful because of com compounded results. I think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you didn't have three, but you just had one language. So you trained on one type of digits and tested on another. Didn - Wasn't there something of that? Where you, say, trained on Spanish and tested on on TI - digits, or the other way around? Something like that?\nphd e: No.\nprofessor b: I thought there was something like that, that he showed me last week. We 'll have to wait till we get \nphd a: Yeah, that would be interesting.\nprofessor b: Um, This may have been what I was asking before, Stephane, but  but, um, wasn't there something that you did, where you trained on one language and tested on another? I mean no no mixture but just \ngrad f: I 'll get it for you.\nphd d: Uh, no, no.\nprofessor b: We 've never just trained on one lang\nphd d: Training on a single language, you mean, and testing on the other one?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Uh, no.\nphd e: Not yet.\nphd d: So the only task that's similar to this is the training on two languages, and that \nprofessor b: But we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language. Right? I mean, you haven't you haven't done all your tests on multiple languages.\nphd d: Uh, No. Either thi this is test with uh the same language but from the broad data, or it's test with uh different languages also from the broad data, excluding the So, it's it's three or three and four.\nphd e: The early experiment that \nphd a: Did you do different languages from digits?\nphd d: Uh. No. You mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other?\nphd a: Digits on another language?\nphd d: No.\nprofessor b: See, I thought you showed me something like that last week. You had a you had a little \nphd d: Uh, No, I don't think so.\nprofessor b: Um What \nphd c: These numbers are uh ratio to baseline?\nprofessor b: So, I mean wha what's the \nphd d: So.\nprofessor b: This this chart this table that we 're looking at is um, show is all testing for TI - digits, or?\ngrad f: Bigger is worse.\nphd d: So you have uh basically two uh parts.\ngrad f: This is error rate, I think.\nphd c: Ratio.\ngrad f: No. No.\nphd d: The upper part is for TI - digits\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nphd d: and it's divided in three rows of four four rows each.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: And the first four rows is well - matched, then the s the second group of four rows is mismatched, and finally highly mismatched. And then the lower part is for Italian and it's the same  the same thing.\nphd a: So, so the upper part is training TI - digits?\nphd d: So. It's it's the HTK results, I mean. So it's HTK training testings with different kind of features\nphd a: Ah.\nphd d: and what appears in the uh left column is the networks that are used for doing this.\nprofessor b: Hmm.\nphd d: So. Uh Yeah.\nprofessor b: Well, What was is that i What was it that you had done last week when you showed Do you remember? Wh - when you showed me the your table last week?\nphd d: It - It was part of these results. Mmm. Mmm.\nphd a: So where is the baseline for the TI - digits located in here?\nphd d: You mean the HTK Aurora baseline?\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: It's uh the one hundred number. It's, well, all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline.\nphd a: Ah! Ah, OK, OK.\nprofessor b: So this is word word error rate, so a high number is bad.\nphd d: Yeah, this is a word error rate ratio.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd a: OK, I see.\nphd d: Yeah. So, seventy point two means that we reduced the error rate uh by thirty thirty percent.\nphd a: OK, OK, gotcha.\nphd d: So.\nprofessor b: OK, so if we take\nphd d: Hmm.\nprofessor b: uh um let's see PLP uh with on - line normalization and delta - del so that's this thing you have circled here in the second column,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: um and \" multi - English \" refers to what?\nphd d: To TIMIT. Mmm. Then you have uh MF, MS and ME which are for French, Spanish and English. And, yeah. Actually I  I uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh features without the s derivatives uh but with increased frame numbers. Mmm. And we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it  it's slightly slightly worse when we don't use delta but it's not  not that much.\nprofessor b: Right. So w w So, I 'm sorry. I missed that. What's MF, MS and ME?\nphd a: Multi - French, Multi - Spanish\nphd d: So. Multi - French, Multi - Spanish, and Multi - English.\nprofessor b: Uh OK. So, it's uh broader vocabulary. Then And \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK so I think what I 'm what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was was there were some numbers I saw, I think, that included these multiple languages and it and I was seeing that it got worse. I I think that was all it was. You had some very limited results that at that point\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: which showed having in these these other languages. In fact it might have been just this last category, having two languages broad that were where where English was removed. So that was cross language and the and the result was quite poor. What I  we hadn't seen yet was that if you added in the English, it's still poor.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh Um now, what's the noise condition um of the training data \nphd d: Still poor.\nprofessor b: Well, I think this is what you were explaining. The noise condition is the same It's the same uh Aurora noises uh, in all these cases for the training.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor b: So there's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test\nphd d: No these are the s s s same noises,\nprofessor b: and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect \nphd d: yeah. At least at least for the first  for the well - matched,\ngrad f: Well matched condition.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: yeah.\nprofessor b: So there's some kind of a a an effect from having these uh this broader coverage um Now I guess what we should try doing with this is try testing these on u this same sort of thing on you probably must have this lined up to do. To try the same t with the exact same training, do testing on the other languages.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: On on um So. Um, oh I well, wait a minute. You have this here, for the Italian. That's right. OK, so, So.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah, so for the Italian the results are uh stranger um Mmm. So what appears is that perhaps Spanish is not very close to Italian because uh, well, when using the the network trained only on Spanish it's  the error rate is almost uh twice the baseline error rate.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Mmm. Uh.\nprofessor b: Well, I mean, let's see.

So like, uh, oh, I don't know, like back vowels, front vowels.\nprofessor b: So what you do um I just wanna understand\nphd d: Um For the moments we do not don't have nets,\nprofessor b: so You have two net or three nets? Was this? How many how many nets do you have? No nets.\nphd d: I mean, It's just Were we just changing the labels to retrain nets with fewer out outputs.\nphd e: Begin to work in this. We are @ @.\nprofessor b: Right. But but I didn't understand \nphd d: And then Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh. the software currently just has uh a allows for I think, the one one hot output. So you 're having multiple nets and combining them, or? Uh, how are you how are you coming up with If you say uh If you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic, how do you \nphd d: It - It's the single net,\nphd a: I think they have one output.\nphd d: yeah.\nprofessor b: Oh, it's just one net.\nphd d: It's one net with um twenty - seven outputs\nphd e: Yeah.\ngrad f: mm - hmm\nphd d: if we have twenty - seven classes,\nprofessor b: I see. I see, OK.\nphd d: yeah. So it's Well, it's basically a standard net with fewer classes.\nprofessor b: So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of yeah.\nphd d: Yeah, but I think Yeah. B b including the features, yeah.\ngrad f: But including the features.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd d: I don't think this will work alone. I think it will get worse because Well, I believe the effect that of of too reducing too much the information is basically basically what happens\nprofessor b: Uh - huh.\nphd d: and \nprofessor b: But you think if you include that plus the other features,\nphd d: but Yeah, because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings, and OGI show showed that, is the distinction between sp speech and silence Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition. I mean the labels are obtained on clean speech, and we add noise after. So this is one thing And But perhaps, something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information. Uh.\nprofessor b: So so again then we have these broad classes and well, somewhat broad. I mean, it's twenty - seven instead of sixty - four, basically. And you have the original features.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Which are PLP, or something.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And then uh, just to remind me, all of that goes into uh, that all of that is transformed by uh, uh, K - KL or something, or?\nphd d: Mm - hmm. There will probably be,\nphd e: Mu.\nphd d: yeah, one single KL to transform everything\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: or uh,\nphd e: No transform the PLP\nphd d: per\nphd e: and only transform the other I 'm not sure.\nprofessor b: Well no,\nphd d: This is still something that\nprofessor b: I think I see.\nphd d: yeah, we don't know \nprofessor b: So there's a question of whether you would \nphd e: Two e @ @ it's one.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Right. Whether you would transform together or just one. Yeah. Might wanna try it both ways. But that's interesting. So that's something that you 're you haven't trained yet but are preparing to train, and \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Um  Yeah, so I think Hynek will be here Monday.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: Monday or Tuesday. So\nphd d: Uh, yeah.\nprofessor b: So I think, you know, we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully, so we can get uh key  key questions answered uh before then\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace, uh uh, it's it's really time to  time to choose.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Um, let me pass this out, by the way. Um These are Did did  did I interrupt you?\nphd e: Yeah, I have one.\nprofessor b: Were there other things that you wanted to \nphd d: Uh, no. I don't think so.\nphd e: \nphd d: Yeah, I have one.\ngrad g: Oh, thanks.\nprofessor b: Ah! OK. OK, we have lots of them.\nphd e: We have one. \nprofessor b: OK, so um, Something I asked So they 're they 're doing the the VAD I guess they mean voice activity detection So again, it's the silence So they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs, I believe. Um I asked uh Hynek whether I haven't talked to Sunil I asked Hynek whether they compared that to just taking the nets we already had and summing up the probabilities.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh. To get the speech voice activity detection, or else just using the silence, if there's only one silence output. Um And, he didn't think they had, um. But on the other hand, maybe they can get by with a smaller net and maybe sometimes you don't run the other, maybe there's a computational advantage to having a separate net, anyway.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So um Their uh  the results look pretty good. Um, I mean, not uniformly.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean, there's a an example or two that you can find, where it made it slightly worse, but uh in in all but a couple examples.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd e: But they have a question of the result. Um how are trained the the LDA filter? How obtained the LDA filter?\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: I I 'm sorry. I don't understand your question.\nphd e: Yes, um the LDA filter needs some training set to obtain the filter. Maybe I don't know exactly how they are obtained.\nprofessor b: It's on training.\nphd e: Training, with the training test of each You understand me?\nprofessor b: No.\nphd e: Yeah, uh for example, LDA filter need a set of  a set of training to obtain the filter.\nprofessor b: Yes.\nphd e: And maybe for the Italian, for the TD TE on for Finnish, these filter are are obtained with their own training set.\nprofessor b: Yes, I don't know. That's that's so that's a that's a very good question, then now that it  I understand it. It's \" yeah, where does the LDA come from? \" In the In earlier experiments, they had taken LDA from a completely different database, right?\nphd e: Yeah. Yeah, because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd e: set.\nprofessor b: So that's a good question. Where does it come from? Yeah, I don't know. Um, but uh to tell you the truth, I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I I was looking at it I was mostly thinking about the  the VAD. And um, it ap it ap Oh what does what does ASP? Oh that's \nphd d: The features, yeah. Yeah.\nphd e: I don't understand also\nprofessor b: It says \" baseline ASP \".\nphd e: what is  what is the difference between ASP and uh baseline over?\nphd c: ASP.\nphd d: Yeah, I don't know.\nphd e: This is \nprofessor b: Anybody know any \nphd c: Oh. There it is.\nprofessor b: Um Cuz there's \" baseline Aurora \" above it.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And it's This is mostly better than baseline, although in some cases it's a little worse, in a couple cases.\nphd c: Well, it says baseline ASP is twenty - three mill minus thirteen.\nphd e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah, it says what it is. But I don't how that's different from \nphd c: From the baseline. OK.\nprofessor b: I think this was  I think this is the same point we were at when when we were up in Oregon.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd d: I think  I think it's the C - zero using C - zero instead of log energy.\nphd e: Ah, OK, mm - hmm.\nphd d: Yeah, it's this.\nprofessor b: Oh. OK.\nphd e: yeah.\nphd d: It should be that, yeah.\nphd a: They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature.\nprofessor b: Shouldn't it be \nphd d: Because \nphd a: Does does anybody know how they 're using it?\nprofessor b: Yeah. So so what they 're doing here is, i\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: if you look down at the block diagram, um, they estimate they get a  they get an estimate of whether it's speech or silence,\nphd a: But that \nprofessor b: and then they have a median filter of it.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And so um, basically they 're trying to find stretches. The median filter is enforcing a i it having some continuity.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: You find stretches where the combination of the frame wise VAD and the  the median filter say that there's a stretch of silence. And then it's going through and just throwing the data away.\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor b: Right? So um \nphd a: So it's it's I don't understand. You mean it's throwing out frames? Before \nprofessor b: It's throwing out chunks of frames, yeah. There's the the median filter is enforcing that it's not gonna be single cases of frames, or isolated frames.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So it's throwing out frames and the thing is um, what I don't understand is how they 're doing this with H T\nphd a: Yeah, that's what I was just gonna ask.\nprofessor b: This is \nphd a: How can you just throw out frames?\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well, you you can,\nphd d: i\nprofessor b: right? I mean y you you \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: it stretches again. For single frames I think it would be pretty hard.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: But if you say speech starts here, speech ends there.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Right?\nphd c: Huh.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah, you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah, so I mean in the i i in the in the decoding, you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here.\nphd d: I t\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I think they 're they 're they 're treating it, you know, like uh well, it's not isolated word, but but connected, you know, the the \nphd a: In the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of. So that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet.\nprofessor b: Well. No they they have numbers though, right? So I think they 're they 're doing something like that. I think that they 're they 're I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that's plausible for the standard. In other words, it's uh I mean from the point of view of of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah. I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this.\nprofessor b: Um. But it's the thing is it's that that that's that's I I Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice, uh uh for listening to, is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Right? And so um\nphd a: Plus it's gonna introduce delays.\nprofessor b: It does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it's it's within the  the boundaries of it.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor b: And the LDA introduces delays, and b what he's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it doesn't introduce uh, any more delay. I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the LDA down here I don't know Wh what's the difference between TLDA and SLDA?\nphd c: Temporal and spectral.\nprofessor b: Ah, thank you.\nphd e: Temporal LDA.\nprofessor b: Yeah, you would know that.\nphd c: Yeah\nprofessor b: So um. The temporal LDA does in fact include the same so that I think he well, by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way, this this delay would work in that way\nphd a: Ah.\nprofessor b: and then it 'd be OK. They they clearly did actually remove silent sections in order because they got these word error rate results. So um I think that it's it's nice to do that in this because in fact, it's gonna give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation. Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard, I don't know. Um. Uh, as you know, part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants  has has approached improving them. So it's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with. So this might just be a temporary thing. But But, on the other hand, and maybe maybe it's a decent idea. So um The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been if you look at what we 've been trying, we 're uh looking at uh, by then I guess, combinations of features and multi - band Uh, and we 've been looking at cross - language, cross task issues. And they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues. But they 've been looking at uh  at these issues. At the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection. And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that, how do we split up the effort? Uh, because we still have even once we choose, we 've still got uh another month or so, I mean there's holidays in the way, but but uh I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there's still a fair amount of time to do things together it's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time.\nphd a: When they removed the silence frames, did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it's  knows when it's time to back trace or something?\nprofessor b: Well, see they, I I think they 're Um. I don't know the  the specifics of how they 're doing it. They 're  they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to um, change the scripts for the recognizer, I believe.\nphd a: Oh, right. Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something?\nprofessor b: So. Uh. Uh, you know that's what I had thought. But I don't I don't think they are.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean that's sort of what the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side, yeah you p put some low level noise or something. Probably don't want all zeros.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: Most recognizers don't like zeros but but you know, put some epsilon in or some rand\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: sorry epsilon random variable in or something.\nphd a: Some constant vector. I mean i w Or something \nprofessor b: Maybe not a constant but it doesn't, uh don't like to divide by the variance of that, but I mean it's\nphd a: That's right. But something that what I mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So that the the silence model in HTK will always pick it up.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So I I that's what I thought they would do. or else, uh uh maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop, I don't know.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: But whatever they did, I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: We c we can find out.\nphd a: Cuz you gotta do something. Otherwise, if it's just a bunch of speech, stuck together \nprofessor b: No they 're \nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: It would do badly\nphd a: Yeah, right.\nprofessor b: and it didn't so badly, right? So they did something.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Uh. So, OK, So I think this brings me up to date a bit. It hopefully brings other people up to date a bit. And um Um I think Uh, I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit and think about it and  and talk with everybody uh, outside of this meeting. Um, but uh No I mean it sounds like I mean there there there are the usual number of of little little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out. And now we 're seem to be kind of in a position to actually uh, look at stuff and and and compare things. So I think that's that's pretty good. Um I don't know what the One of the things I wonder about, coming back to the first results you talked about, is is how much, uh things could be helped by more parameters. And uh  And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have, in terms of the uh computational limits. Because anyway when we go to twice as much data and have the same number of parameters, particularly when it's twice as much data and it's quite diverse, um, I wonder if having twice as many parameters would help.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh, just have a bigger hidden layer. Uh But I doubt it would help by forty per cent. But but uh\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Just curious. How are we doing on the resources? Disk, and \nphd d: I think we 're alright,\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: um, not much problems with that.\nprofessor b: Computation?\nphd d: It's OK.\nprofessor b: We \nphd d: Well this table took uh more than five days to get back.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah, well.\nphd d: But Yeah.\nprofessor b: Are were you folks using Gin? That's a that just died, you know?\nphd d: Mmm, no. You were using Gin perhaps, yeah? No.\nphd e: No.\nprofessor b: No? Oh, that's good.\ngrad f: It just died.\nprofessor b: OK. Yeah, we 're gonna get a replacement server that 'll be a faster server, actually.\nphd e: Yes.\nprofessor b: That 'll be It's a seven hundred fifty megahertz uh SUN\nphd d: Hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: uh But it won't be installed for a little while.\nphd c: Tonic.\nprofessor b: U Go ahead.\ngrad g: Do we Do we have that big new IBM machine the, I think in th\nprofessor b: We have the little tiny IBM machine that might someday grow up to be a big IBM machine. It's got s slots for eight, uh IBM was donating five, I think we only got two so far, processors. We had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors. They ended up being five fifty. So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz, we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz. And more are supposed to come soon and there's only a moderate amount of dat of memory. So I don't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it, but uh Hopefully, they 'll get us some more parts, soon and Uh, yeah, I think that 'll be once we get it populated, that 'll be a nice machine. I mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there. And uh and uh a nice amount of memory. Uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast Linux machine.\ngrad g: And if we can do things on Linux, some of the machines we have going already, like Swede?\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Um It seems pretty fast.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: But I think Fudge is pretty fast too.\nprofessor b: Yeah, I mean you can check with uh Dave Johnson. I mean, it it's  I think the machine is just sitting there. And it does have two processors, you know and  Somebody could do  you know, uh, check out uh the multi - threading libraries. And I mean i it's possible that the I mean, I guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on  on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there aren't five or eight. There's there's there's gonna be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight, to have it really be useful. But. Notice how I said somebody and turned my head your direction. That's one thing you don't get in these recordings. You don't get the  don't get the visuals but \ngrad g: I is it um mostly um the neural network trainings that are um slowing us down or the HTK runs that are slowing us down?\nprofessor b: Uh, I think yes. Uh, Isn't that right? I mean I think you 're you 're sort of held up by both, right? If the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything running through these a hundred times faster because you 'd be stuck by the HTK trainings,\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: right?\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: But if the HTK I mean I think they 're both It sounded like they were roughly equal? Is that about right?\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad g: Because, um I think that 'll be running Linux, and Sw - Swede and Fudge are already running Linux so, um I could try to get um the train the neural network trainings or the HTK stuff running under Linux, and to start with I 'm wondering which one I should pick first.\nprofessor b: Uh, probably the neural net cuz it's probably it it's  it's um Well, I I don't know. They both HTK we use for um this Aurora stuff Um Um, I think It's not clear yet what we 're gonna use for trainings uh Well, there's the trainings uh is it the training that takes the time, or the decoding? Uh, is it about equal between the two? For for Aurora?\nphd d: For HTK?\nprofessor b: For Yeah. For the Aurora?\nphd d: Uh Training is longer.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK. Well, I don't know how we can I don't know how to Do we have HTK source? Is that Yeah.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: You would think that would fairly trivially the training would, anyway, th the testing uh I don't I don't think would parallelize all that well. But I think that you could certainly do d um, distributed, sort of  Ah, no, it's the  each individual sentence is pretty tricky to parallelize. But you could split up the sentences in a test set.\nphd a: They have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile, in H T And you can parallelize the training.\nprofessor b: Yeah?\nphd a: And run it on several machines\nprofessor b: Aha!\nphd a: and it just basically keeps counts. And there's something  a final thing that you run and it accumulates all the counts together.\nprofessor b: I see.\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd a: I don't what their scripts are set up to do for the Aurora stuff, but \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than this Aurora stuff, uh what do we do, large vocabulary training slash testing for uh tandem systems. Cuz we hadn't really done much with tandem systems for larger stuff. Cuz we had this one collaboration with CMU and we used SPHINX. Uh, we 're also gonna be collaborating with SRI and we have their have theirs. Um So I don't know Um. So I I think the the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we 're gonna use the neural net trainings, no matter what, for a lot of the things we 're doing,\ngrad g: OK.\nprofessor b: whereas, w exactly which HMM Gaussian - mixture - based HMM thing we use is gonna depend uh So with that, maybe we should uh go to our digit recitation task. And, it's about eleven fifty. Canned. Uh, I can I can start over here. Great, uh, could you give Adam a call. Tell him to He's at two nine seven seven.\ngrad f: Oh.\nprofessor b: OK. I think we can @ @ You know Herve's coming tomorrow, right? Herve will be giving a talk, yeah, talk at eleven.

Is it \nphd f: Uh, well, OK, I 'll back up.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd f: Um, at the previous at last week's meeting, this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam, um, and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um, since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us,\nphd a: Well, great.\nphd f: th the guy that was at the last meeting.\nphd a: Great.\nphd f: And he's already funded part - time, so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time,\nphd a: What a deal.\nphd f: uh Yeah.\ngrad b: And what's he interested in, specifically?\nphd f: So he's comes from a signal - processing background, but I liked him a lot cuz he's very interested in higher level things, like language, and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm. Great.\nphd f: so he's just getting his feet wet in that. Anyway, I thought OK, maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January, next semester that we 'd have, you know, enough data to work with.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd f: But, um, Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want, and so forth. So, I thought about that and I think it's still possible, um, but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about, and hear, then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time \ngrad b: One offs?\nphd f: Yeah, just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses, both to get the, um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it, like well, I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization, or what's this meeting about. I mean it's very different if you have a group that's just giving a report on what they did that week, versus coming to a decision and so forth. So. Then I was um, talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area, sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns, like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech, sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting, or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to. And in that uh, regard, I thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains, or a few different kinds of meetings. So this this meeting is one of them, although I 'm not sure I can participate if I You know, I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: Um, and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned, like the front - end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting.\ngrad b: Right. Yep. Yeah, we 're we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly.\nphd f: So So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough.\ngrad b: So. Mm - hmm.\nphd f: But basically, for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting  meaning out of the meeting, um, it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize,\ngrad b: Yeah.\nphd f: but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries. And then we need a couple that of  We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group, but @ @ three or four different kinds.\ngrad b: Yeah, we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting.\nprofessor d: S So \nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: See, I 've never listened to the data for the front - end meeting.\ngrad b: Yeah, we we 've only had three.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: So.\nphd f: OK. But maybe that's enough. So, in general, I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same.\ngrad b: Um \nprofessor d: Now, let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I I don't disagree with that, but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too. Uh, for other kinds of research, particularly the acoustic oriented research, I actually feel the opposite need. I 'd like to have lots of different people.\nphd f: Right. Right.\nprofessor d: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view. I 'd like to have many different speakers. So, um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings, of somebody coming down from campus, and and uh,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: I mean, sure, if we can get more from them, fine,\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: Right.\nprofessor d: but if we only get one or two from each group, that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people.\nphd f: Yeah, I definitely agree with that.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: Definitely.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers. Because I think if you just say an And in particular, my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that uh, it would be useful for for purposes You know.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: But you know, I think I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all. And and the English you 'd have The language models would be really hard to build\nprofessor d: Well, you want to i\npostdoc e: because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a \nprofessor d: Well, OK, uh, first place, I I I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another, I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I I think that's what we 're investigating,\npostdoc e: OK.\nphd f: It has to be a a pre - existing meeting, like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway.\nprofessor d: so\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor d: Yeah, yeah.\npostdoc e: OK.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: So I was I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh, and and and uh, senior uh, uh, d and uh, doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here.\nphd f: That's I think what we and I agree with.\npostdoc e: Oh, interesting!\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Oh, I see. Oh, interesting!\nprofessor d: Uh, that's the first point. The second point is um I think that for some time now, going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that \npostdoc e: Oh, oh. I 'm not saying accents. u The accent's not the problem.\nprofessor d: Oh, OK.\npostdoc e: No, it's more a matter of uh, proficiency, e e just simply fluency.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\npostdoc e: I mean, I deal with people on on campus who I think sometimes people, undergraduates um in computer science uh, have language skills that make, you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong.\nprofessor d: Oh! You 're not talking about foreign language at all.\ngrad b: Yeah. Yeah, just talking about.\nprofessor d: You 're just talking about \npostdoc e: Well, e I just think,\ngrad b: We all had the same thought.\npostdoc e: but you know, it's like when you get into the graduate level, uh, no problem. I mean, I 'm not saying accents.\nphd c: Uh - huh.\nprofessor d: Yeah, then we 're completely gone.\npostdoc e: I 'm say I 'm saying fluency.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: It's The the habits are already burnt in.\npostdoc e: Well, yeah. I 'm just saying fluency.\nprofessor d: But \ngrad b: Well, I think that, um I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English. And and I think if it's a pre - existing meeting and it's held in English, I I think it's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh, g particularly good English skills.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\npostdoc e: OK, now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that um, there's there's this this issue, you have a corpus out there, it should be used for for multiple things cuz it's so expensive to put together.\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor d: Right.\npostdoc e: And if people want to approach Um, i so I know e e You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group,\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\npostdoc e: but the idea of language models, which are fund you know generally speaking uh, you know, t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in  um, i more fluent, more more close to being academic English, then it would seem to me to be a good thing.\nprofessor d: I guess I maybe Hmm. I\npostdoc e: Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have Uh, so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that's the worst possible case. If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't uh, they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing, uh, language model,\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\npostdoc e: this is the worst case scenario.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Well, that's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group.\npostdoc e: And \ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor d: because because they most the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards.\npostdoc e: Well Oh. But the thing is, I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that \nprofessor d: I see.\npostdoc e: And I 'm not objecting to accents.\nprofessor d: OK.\npostdoc e: I I 'm I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view, could we have a language model, a a grammar a grammar, basically, that um, wo would be a a possibility.\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\npostdoc e: So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky's model, an and do some top - down stuff, it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever, uh, it seems like um, I don't see that there's an argument \nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: I 'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus, since it's so expensive to put together, uh, useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are, you know, used in computational linguistics.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: That's that's my point. Which which includes both top - down and bottom - up.\nphd c: It's difficult.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK, well, i i let's let's see what we can get. I mean, it it I think that if we 're aiming at at uh, groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together, and it's from the Berkeley campus, probably most of it will be OK,\npostdoc e: Yes, that's fine. That's fine. Exactly. And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population.\nprofessor d: but OK. OK.\nphd f: I definitely agree with that, I mean, for this purpose.\nprofessor d: OK.\ngrad b: Well, not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen, probably even an anyone under twenty - one.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Grads and professors, fine.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: So.\nprofessor d: Oh, you age - ist!\ngrad b: What's that? Well, age - ist. The \" eighteen \" is because of the consent form.\npostdoc e: Age - ist.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: Right, Yeah.\ngrad b: We 'd hafta get find their parent to sign for them.\nphd c: \" Age - ist \". Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yes.\npostdoc e: Yeah, that's true.\ngrad b: So.\nphd f: I have a uh, um, question. Well, Morgan, you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else, cuz there's a \nprofessor d: They 're they 're yeah, they 're d they 're uh assessing whether they should do that or y do something else, hopefully over the next few weeks.\nphd f: Cuz I mean, one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment, if she weren't using it, could we set up a room in the linguistics department? And and I mean, there there may be a lot more or or in psych, or in comp wherever, in another building where we could um, record people there. I think we 'd have a better chance\ngrad b: I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that. We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this.\nphd f: Right, but Right. But if there were such a I mean it's a remote possibility, then um, you know, one of us could you know, go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here.\ngrad b: Yep.\nphd f: So it's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware.\nprofessor d: Well, the other thing Yeah, I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around.\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor d: Uh. But. Um, and \ngrad b: Well, I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS. You know, to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult.\nprofessor d: Uh Yeah.\nphd f: But you may not need a separate room, you know,\ngrad b: That's true.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd f: the idea is, if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth, and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something \ngrad b: True. Mm - hmm. Yep.\nprofessor d: Well, maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something.\nphd f: Huh.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: You know.\nphd f: I I think it's not out of the question.\ngrad b: Yeah, I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd f: Um. So.\ngrad b: another type of meeting.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: Right.\nphd c: But I I I think you need, uh, another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do, eh, more e easier the recording process, eh, out from ICSI.\nphd f: Right.\ngrad b: Hmm.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: Eh and probably. I don't know.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd c: Eh, if you you want to to record, eh, a seminar or a class, eh, in the university, you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put, eh, a lot of, eh, head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with, eh, this kind of, eh, d device.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: Yeah, but I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones, that's easy.\nphd c: Oh - yeah.\ngrad b: Right? That's very easy,\nphd c: Ye - Yeah, yeah.\ngrad b: but that's not the corpus that we 're collecting.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Actually, that's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that's maybe worth repeating. We realized that, um, when we were talking about this that, OK, there's these different things that we want to do with it. So, um, it's true that we wanna be selective in some ways, uh, the way that you were speaking about with, uh, not having an interlingua and uh, these other issues. But on the other hand, it's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it. So, a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that's done with a small n recorded with a small, uh, typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that's, uh, just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that's OK too. Uh, i We realized in discussion that the other thing is, what about this business of distant and close microphones? I mean, we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way, that's why we did it. But what about For th for these issues of summarization, a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone.\nphd f: Right, I mean, I c I think there's \ngrad b: And you don't really need the close microphone, you mean.\nprofessor d: You actually don't.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: Yea - yeah yeah, you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone.\npostdoc e: Which one did you mean?\nprofessor d: You d You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone, somewhere.\ngrad b: Ye - Yeah. Yep.\nphd f: You can use found data.\ngrad b: Tape recorder.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Oh.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: You you can.\nprofessor d: You need some microphone,\nphd f: You can\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: but I mean \nphd f: use Um, but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect,\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd f: you know, each person who's interested in I mean, we have a cou we have a bunch of different, um, slants and perspectives on what it's useful for, um, they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want.\nprofessor d: Right.\nphd f: And So in my case, um, I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others.\ngrad b: Not enough for others, right.\nphd f: And so I 'm looking and thinking, \" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it's to help th in my interest. \"\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: And other people need to do that for themselves, uh, h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal \nprofessor d: Right. So that \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about, \" Well, gee, we have this really complicated setup to do, \" well maybe you don't.\ngrad b: Yeah. For some of it.\nprofessor d: Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that's good enough to get a uh, a transcription from later, you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording.\nphd f: Right.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: I mean, we we could have a fairly We could just get a DAT machine and \nphd f: Well, I agree with Jane, though, on the other hand that \nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: So that might be true, you may say for instance, summarization, or something that sounds very language oriented. You may say well, \" Oh yeah, you just do that from transcripts of a radio show. \" I mean, you don't even need the speech signal.\nprofessor d: Right.\nphd f: But what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this. There's lots of cues you 're not gonna have.\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd f: So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information, which is really what makes this corpus powerful.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Special? Yep.\nprofessor d: I I I I I agree.\nphd f: Otherwise, you know, lots of other sites can propose individual studies, so \nprofessor d: Uh but I I think that the uh i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: And so, uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say, \" Oh, we 'll just do it up there, \" \nphd f: OK.\nprofessor d: If you 're talking about something simple, where you throw away a lot of these dimensions, then you can do that right away. Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here, it won't happen quickly, it won't be easy, and there's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe, or else hauling it around, and all sorts of o\nphd f: So then maybe we should  try to bring people here.\ngrad b: Here.\nprofessor d: I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here.\nphd f: I mean, that's that's OK, so\nprofessor d: We 're set up for it.\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: The room is is really, uh, underused.\nphd f: OK.\nprofessor d: Uh \nphd f: Right.\npostdoc e: I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea.\ngrad b: Yeah, I thought so too.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Free lunch is good.\nphd f: Yeah, I And I think we can get people to come here, that But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down.\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: No crunchy food.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd f: So  Well, it would be lunch afterwards.\ngrad b: Well, I was thinking, lunch after.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nphd f: Right. And they 'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: Yeah, they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food.\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad b: Um, I had a I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered.\nprofessor d: Yeah\ngrad b: Should I pursue that?\nphd f: Oh, definitely, yeah.\ngrad b: Yeah. So. They they originally They 've decided not to do go into speech.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer, but I 'll send an email and ask.\nprofessor d: Tell them about the free lunch.\ngrad b: I 'll tell them about the free lunch.\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad b: And they 'll say there's no such thing.\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad b: So.\nphd f: I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers, cuz these are both weird \ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: The the The oth the other h\nphd f: well, I know, I shouldn't say that.\ngrad b: That's alright. No, the they they 're very weird.\nphd f: We need a wider sampling.\nphd a: \" Beep. \"\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh, \" beep \"\ngrad b: The problem with engineers is \" beep. \"\nprofessor d: Uh, the the They make funny sounds. The o the o the other The other thing is, uh, that we we talked about is give to them uh, burn an extra CD - ROM.\ngrad b: Yep. Let them have their meeting.\nprofessor d: and give them So if they want a  basically and audio record of their \nphd f: Well, I thought that was I thought he meant, \" Give them a music CD, \" like they g Then he said a CD of the of their speech\nprofessor d: Oh.\nphd f: and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to, but You know, I personally would not want a CD of my meeting,\ngrad b: Mmm. Of the meeting?\nphd f: but maybe yeah, maybe you 're\nprofessor d: If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like \nphd f: right. Right. Right.\nphd a: Oh, that's a good idea.\ngrad b: It 'd be fun. I think it would just be fun, you know, if nothing else, you know.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd f: Right.\ngrad b: It's a novelty item.\nprofessor d: But it als It it it also I think builds up towards the goal.\nphd f: Right.\nprofessor d: We 're saying, \" Look, you know, you 're gonna get this. Is - is isn't that neat. Then you 're gonna go home with it. It's actually p It's probably gonna be pretty useless to you,\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: but you 'll ge appreciate, you know, where it's useful and where it's useless,\nphd f: Right.\nprofessor d: and then, we 're gonna move this technology, so it 'll become useful. \"\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So.\nphd f: No, I think that's a great idea, actually.\nphd a: What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back?\npostdoc e: Alth\nphd f: But we might need a little more to incentivize them, that's all.\ngrad b: Oh, yeah. I mean, anyone can have the transcripts. So. I thought we could point that out.\nprofessor d: Oh yeah.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nphd f: Well, that's interesting.\npostdoc e: I hav I have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately, because of these issues of, you know, this kind of stuff, where maybe You know?\nprofessor d: Good point. That's a very good point.\npostdoc e: So.\nprofessor d: So we can so we can \npostdoc e: We could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage.\nprofessor d: r Right.\npostdoc e: And then they they get a CD, but just not the same day.\nphd f: Oh, right.\ngrad b: Yeah, that's right.\nphd f: If It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically,\ngrad b: That's a good point. Right, it can't be the internal one.\nphd f: right?\nprofessor d: Although it's \nphd f: Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone.\npostdoc e: There we go.\ngrad b: That's right.\npostdoc e: Oh, I like that. Well put. Well put. So, after the transcript screening phase.\ngrad b: Yeah, that's true.\npostdoc e: Things have been weeded out.\nphd f: Otherwise we 'd need two lawyer stages.\npostdoc e: Yeah, that's right, say \" Yeah, well, I got this CD, and, Your Honor, I \"\ngrad b: Yeah.\nphd f: That's a good point.\nprofessor d: Yeah so that's so let's start with Haas, and Yeah.\nphd f: Sorry to have to  Sorry I have to leave.\nprofessor d: Oh, that's fine.\nphd f: I will be here full - time next week.\ngrad b: OK, see you.\nprofessor d: OK.\ngrad b: No. Bye.\nprofessor d: That's alright.\nphd a: See you.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd c: See you.\nprofessor d: So, uh Let's see. So that was that topic, and then um, I guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question for \ngrad b: We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings. So I uh did a bunch of archiving, and still doing a bunch of archiving, I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from uh, Broadcast News. and it took eleven hours to do to uh copy it.\nphd c: Eleven?\ngrad b: And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone.\nphd a: Where did you copy it to?\ngrad b: Well, it's Abbott. It's Abbott, so it just But it's it's a lot of data.\nprofessor d: Sk - It's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott?\ngrad b: Tape.\nphd c: Tape?\nphd a: Oh, on the tape.\nprofessor d: Oh!\ngrad b: I did an archive.\nprofessor d: I 'm sorry.\nphd a: Ah!\ngrad b: So I 'm archiving it, and then I 'm gonna delete the files.\nphd c: Oh.\ngrad b: So that will give us ten gigabytes of free space.\nphd c: Eleven hours?\nphd a: Wow!\nphd c: Oh.\npostdoc e: Yeah, the archiving m program does take a long time.\ngrad b: And and \nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Yep. And so one That that will be done, like, in about two hours. And so uh, at that point we 'll be able to record five more meetings. So.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: One thing The good news about that that is that once once it's archived, it's pretty quick to get back.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Is it?\npostdoc e: I mean, it it it The other direction is fast, but this direction is really slow.\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor d: Hmm.\ngrad b: Well, especially because I 'm generating a clone, also.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: So. And that takes a while.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Yeah, OK.\nphd a: Generating a clone?\npostdoc e: Yeah, that's a good point.\ngrad b: Two copies.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nphd a: Oh!\ngrad b: One offsite, one onsite.\nphd a: Oh! Hunh!\nprofessor d: S\npostdoc e: Now, what will uh Is the plan to g to So stuff will be saved, it's just that you 're relocating it? I mean, so we 're gonna get more disk space? Or did I?\ngrad b: No, the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News, which are regeneratable regeneratable\npostdoc e: OK. Oh, good. I see.\ngrad b: um, if we really need to, but we had a lot of them. And for the full, uh, hundred forty hour sets.\npostdoc e: OK.\ngrad b: And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Wow. Wow.\nprofessor d: W w we are getting more space. We are getting, uh, another disk rack and and four thirty - six gigabyte disks. Uh so uh but that's not gonna happen instantaneously.\npostdoc e: Wonderful.\ngrad b: Or maybe six.\nprofessor d: Or maybe six?\ngrad b: The SUN, ha uh, takes more disks than the Andatico one did. The SUN rack takes  Th - One took four and one took six, or maybe it was eight and twelve. Whatever it was, it was, you know, fifty percent more.\nprofessor d: How many How much \nphd a: Is there a difference in price or something?\ngrad b: Well, what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years, according to Dave, and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices.\nphd a: Oh!\nphd c: Oh.\ngrad b: And so, uh, we 're looking into other vendors. \" We \" By \" we \" of course I mean Dave.\npostdoc e: Wow.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: So.\nphd a: Hmm. I 've been looking at the, uh, Aurora data and, um, first first look at it, there were basically three directories on there that could be moved. One was called Aurora, one was Spanish, which was Carmen's Spanish stuff, and the other one was, um, SPINE.\ngrad b: SPINE.\nphd a: And so, um, I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk. So, um, I realized that well, probably not all of that should be moved, just the CD - ROM type data, the  the static data. So I moved that, and then um, I asked him to check out and see if it was OK. before I actually deleted the old stuff, um, but I haven't heard back yet. I told him he could delete it if he wanted to, I haven't checked today to see if he's deleted it or not. And then Carmen's stuff, I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA, I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data. And so, I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data. And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk. And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff. I have to meet with, uh, Stephane to do that. So.\nprofessor d: So, but, uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News, but, we have some other disks, some of which you 're using for Aurora, but are we g do we have some other other space now?\ngrad b: Yep. So, so, uh, we have space on the current disk right now, where Meeting Recorder is, and that's probably enough for about four meetings.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: Is that the one that has is that DC?\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: So. Yep. No, no, well, it's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is. I think it's DI.\nphd a: OK, I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we \ngrad b: I don't remember. Th - I think it's DC - It's whatever that one is.\nphd a: OK, DC.\ngrad b: I just don't remember, it might be DC.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad b: And that has enough for about four more meetings right now. Yeah, I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Um, someone deleted something somewhere. And so we have some room again. And then with Broadcast News, that's five or six more meetings, so, you know, we have a couple weeks. Uh, so, yeah, I think I think we 're OK, until we get the new disk.\nphd c: OK.\nphd a: So should, um One question I had for you was, um, we need  we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk. Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would?\ngrad b: We should put it onto the Broadcast News one. That's probably the best thing to do. And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out.\nphd a: OK. Right. Right. Do you know what happen to know what disk that is off? OK.\ngrad b: No. I mean, I can tell you, I just don't know off the top of my head.\nphd a: Yeah. OK. Alright, I 'll find out from you.\ngrad b: But, so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today, once the archive is complete, and I 've verified it.\nphd a: OK.\ngrad b: Cuz that 'll give us plenty of disk.\nprofessor d: Uh, OK, @ @ So, uh, then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what Jose has been doing,\nphd c: Uh - huh. OK.\nprofessor d: so\nphd c: I have, eh, The result of my work during the last days.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd c: Thank you for your information because I I read. Eh, and the the last, eh, days, eh, I work, eh, in my house, eh, in a lot of ways and thinking, reading eh, different things about the the Meeting Recording project.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\nphd c: And I have, eh, some ideas. Eh, this information is very very useful. Because you have the the the distribution, now.\npostdoc e: I 'm glad to hear it. Glad to hear it.\nphd c: But for me, eh is interesting because, eh, eh, here's i is the demonstration of the overlap, eh, problem.\ngrad b: I 've seen it already.\nphd c: It's a real problem, a frequently problem uh, because you have overlapping zones eh, eh, eh, all the time.\npostdoc e: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad b: Yep.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Throughout the meeting.\nphd c: Eh, by a moment I have, eh, nnn, the, eh, n I I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording, with eh, a exact mark.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm. Oh, you did that by hand?\nphd c: Heh? That's eh, yet b b Yeah, by b b by hand by hand because, eh, eh \" Why. \"\ngrad b: Can I see that? Can I get a copy?\nprofessor d: Oh.\nphd c: My my idea is to work \nphd a: Wow!\nphd c: I I I do I don I don't @ @ I don't know, eh, if, eh, it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh, enough time to to to work. uh, only just eh, six months, as you know, but, eh, my idea is, eh, is very interesting to to work in in the line of, eh, automatic segmenter.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Eh but eh, eh, in my opinion, we need eh, eh, a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool.\ngrad b: Yes, absolutely. And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already?\nphd c: And No, no, with i\ngrad b: Have you done that or are you planning to do that?\nphd c: Sorry? No, I I plan to do that.\ngrad b: OK. Darn!\nphd c: I plan I plan, but eh, eh, the idea is the is the following. Now, eh, I need ehm, to detect eh all the overlapping zones exactly. I I will I will eh, talk about eh, in the in the blackboard about the my ideas.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: Duration.\nphd c: Eh, um, eh This information eh, with eh, exactly time marks eh, for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone, and eh, a speaker a a pure speech eh, eh, speaker zone. I mean, eh zones eh of eh speech of eh, one speaker without any any eh, noise eh, any any acoustic event eh that eh, eh, w eh, is not eh, speech, real speech. And, I need t true eh, silence for that, because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh, what, eh, are more m more discriminant to eh, classify.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones. The idea is to eh to use eh, I 'm not sure to eh yet, but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or, nnn, a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the, eh, the property of the different feat eh feature, eh, to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: And my idea is eh, it would be interesting to to have eh, a control set. And my control set eh, will be the eh, silence, silence without eh, any any noise.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: Which means that we 'd still You 'd hear the \ngrad b: Yeah, fans.\nphd c: Yeah, acoustic with this. With with, yeah, the background.\npostdoc e: Yeah. That's interesting. This is like a ground level, with It's not it's not total silence.\nphd c: Eh, I I mean eh, noise eh, eh claps eh, tape clips, eh, the difference eh,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: eh, eh, event eh, which, eh, eh, has, eh eh, a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech.\ngrad b: So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them?\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Yeah, I have mark in in in in that Not in all in all the the file,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: only eh, eh, nnn, mmm, I have eh, ehm I don't remind what is the the the the quantity, but eh, I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones. I have, eh, two hundred and thirty, more or less, overlapping zones, and is similar to to this information,\ngrad b: Whew! Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: Great. Great.\nphd c: because with the program, I cross the information of uh, of Jane with eh, my my segmentation by hand. And is eh, mor more similar.\npostdoc e: Excellent. Glad to hear it. Good.\nphd c: But Sorry, sorry.\nprofessor d: Go ahead.\nphd c: And the the idea is, eh, I I will use, eh, I want  My idea is, eh, to eh  to classify.\ngrad b: I should 've got the digital camera. Oh well.\nphd c: I I need eh, the exact eh, mark of the different, eh, eh, zones because I I want to put, eh, for eh, each frame a label indicating. It's a sup supervised and, eh, hierarchical clustering process. I I I put, eh, eh, for each frame a label indicating what is th the type, what is the class, eh, which it belong.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Eh, I mean, the class you will overlapping speech \" overlapping \" is a class, eh, \" speech \" @ @ the class that's\ngrad b: Nonspeech.\nphd a: These will be assigned by hand?\nphd c: a I I I ha I h I I put the mark by hand,\nphd a: Based on the Uh - huh.\nphd c: because, eh, my idea is, eh, in in the first session, I need, eh, I I need, eh, to be sure that the information eh, that, eh, I I will cluster, is is right. Because, eh, eh, if not, eh, I will I will, eh, return to the speech file to analyze eh, what is the problems,\ngrad b: Well, training, and validation. Sure. Mm - hmm.\nphd c: eh. And I I 'd prefer I would prefer, the to to have, eh, this labeled automatically, but, eh, eh, fro th I need truth.\nphd a: You need truth. Hmm.\ngrad b: Yeah, but this is what you 're starting with.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\npostdoc e: I 've gotta ask you. So, uh, the difference between the top two, i So so I start at the bottom, so \" silence \" is clear. By \" speech \" do you mean speech by one sp by one person only?\nphd c: Speech Yeah.\npostdoc e: So this is un OK, and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time, or or a speaker and a breath overlapping, someone else's breath, or or clicking, overlapping with speech So, that that's all those possibilities in the top one.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. Is \ngrad b: One or two or more.\nphd c: One, two, three. but No, by th by the moment n Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\npostdoc e: OK.\nphd c: Eh, in the first moment, because, eh, eh, I I have information, eh, of the overlapping zones, eh, information about if the, eh, overlapping zone is, eh, from a speech, clear speech, from a one to a two eh speaker, or three speaker, or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh, overlaps eh, onto eh, a speech, another, especially speech.\npostdoc e: So it's basi it's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping, which could be speech but doesn't need to be.\nphd c: No, no, es especially eh, overlapping speech from, eh, different eh, eh, speaker. Eh \nprofessor d: No, but there's but, I think she's saying \" Where do you In these three categories, where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech? \"\nphd c: Ah!\nprofessor d: Which category do you put that in?\npostdoc e: Yeah, that's right. That's my question.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah, he here I I put eh speech from eh, from, eh, one speaker without, eh, eh, any any any events more.\npostdoc e: Oh!\nprofessor d: Right, so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time?\nphd c: Where? Where What is the class?\nprofessor d: Which catege which category?\npostdoc e: Like a c\nphd c: No. By the moment, no.\ngrad b: Yeah, yeah, that's what he was saying before.\nphd c: For for the by the @ @ no, @ @ because I I I I want to limit the the nnn, the the study.\nprofessor d: Oh, so you not not marked.\npostdoc e: Oh. So you don't i i it's not in that \nprofessor d: OK. Got it. Fine. So so \nphd a: So you 're not using all of the data.\ngrad b: Yeah, so that's what he was saying before, is that he excluded those.\nphd c: The All I Exactly.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah, you mean \nprofessor d: Yeah.\npostdoc e: So you 're ignoring overlapping events unless they 're speech with speech.\nphd c: Yeah, be Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah, that's fine.\npostdoc e: OK.\nphd c: \" Why? Why? What's the reason? \" because i it's the first study. the first\nprofessor d: Oh, no no, it's a perfectly sensible way to go. We just wondered trying to understand what what you were doing.\npostdoc e: We 're just\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK.\npostdoc e: Yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: So, this is this is a subset.\nphd c: Yeah. In the in the future, the the idea is to to extend the class,\nphd a: Is is \nphd c: to consider all the all the information, you you mentioned before\nprofessor d: Yeah. Yeah, I I don't think we were asking for that.\npostdoc e: OK.\nphd c: but eh, the the first idea Because eh, I don't know what hap what will happen with the study.\nprofessor d: We were jus just trying to understand \npostdoc e: Yeah. Yeah, we just wanted to know what the category was here.\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Sure.\nphd a: Is your silence category pure silence, or?\nphd c: Yeah. i it's pure \nphd a: What if there was a door - slam or something?\nphd c: No, no, it's pure silence.\nphd a: Pure silence.\nphd c: It's the control set.\nphd a: OK.\nphd c: OK? It's the control set. It's pure si pure silence with the with the machine on the on the roof.\nprofessor d: What you Well w I I think what you m I think what you mean is that it's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises.\ngrad b: With the fan.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Right? Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling \" event \" is somebody coughing or clicking, or rustling paper, or hitting something, which are impulsive noises.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: But steady - state noises are part of the background.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Which, are being, included in that. Right?\nphd c: h here yet, yet I I I I I think I I think, eh, there are that some kind of noises that, eh, don't don't wanted to to be in that, eh, in that control set.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\npostdoc e: So it's like a signal - noise situation. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Well Yeah.\nphd c: But I prefer, I prefer at at the first, eh, the the silence with eh, this eh this kind of the of eh of noise.\npostdoc e: Well, steady state.\nprofessor d: Right, it's I mean, it's \" Background \" might be might be a better word than \" silence \".\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: It's just sort of that the the background acoustic \nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Right. So Fine. Go on.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd c: Is is is only OK.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd c: And, um, with this information The idea is eh, eh, nnn, I have a label for for each, eh, frame and, eh with a cluster eh algorithm I and \npostdoc e: Well, we needed to get the categories, yeah.\nphd c: Sorry. And eh I am going to prepare a test bed, eh, well, eh, a a set of feature structure eh, eh, models.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: And my idea is\ngrad b: \" Tone \", whatever.\nphd c: so so on because I have a pitch extractor yet.\nprofessor d: Right.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: I have to to test, but eh I \nphd a: You have your own?\nphd c: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nphd a: Oh!\nphd c: I ha I have prepare. Is a modified version of of of a pitch tracker, eh, from, eh, Standar - eh Stanford University in Stanford? No. From, eh, em, Cambridge University.\nphd a: Oh! What's it written in?\nphd c: Eh, em, I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author, because I I have several I have eh, eh, em, eh, library tools, from eh, Festival and of from Edinburgh eh, from Cambridge, eh, and from our department.\nphd a: Ah.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd c: And And I have to because, in general the pitch tracker, doesn't work very well and \ngrad b: Bad. Right. But, you know, as a feature, it might be OK. So, we don't know.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. This this is And th the idea is to to, eh, to obtain, eh, for example, eh, eh diff eh, eh, different well, no, a great number of eh FEC for example, eh, eh, twenty - five, eh, thirty thirty parameters, eh, for for each one. And in a first eh, nnn, step in the investi in the research in eh, my idea is try to, eh, to prove, what is the performance of the difference parameter, eh to classify the different, eh, what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh, the different, eh, frames of each class eh and what is the the, nnn, nnn, nnn, eh, what is the, the error eh, of the data\ngrad b: Supervised clustering. Mm - hmm.\nphd c: This is the the eh, first idea\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: and the second is try to eh, to use some ideas eh, similar to the linear discriminant analysis.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Eh? Eh, similar, because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh, each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm. What sort of classifier ar?\nphd c: Eh, the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh, similar, nnn, that the classifier used eh, in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is eh, used to to eh, some distance to to put eh, a vector eh, in in a class different.\ngrad b: Unimodal?\nphd c: Is Yeah? W with a model, is is only to cluster using a eh, @ @ or a similarity.\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: So is it just one cluster per \nphd c: A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: But eh what's the p What is my idea? What's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network? If w when this kind of eh, mmm, cluster, clustering algorithm to can test, to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh, eh put up with your hand in the different parameter,\ngrad b: Right, you can't analyse it.\nphd c: but eh If you use a neural net is is a good idea, but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net.\nprofessor d: Well, actually, you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: It's hard to w w what you It's hard to tell on a neural net is what's going on internally.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: But it's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs, especially if they 're all normalized.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um, but \ngrad b: Well, using something simpler first I think is probably fine.\nprofessor d: Well, this isn't tru if if if you really wonder what different if if \nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Decision tree.\nphd c: But \nprofessor d: Yeah, then a decision tree is really good, but the thing is here he's he's not he's not like he has one you know, a bunch of very distinct variables, like pitch and this he's talking about, like, a all these cepstral coefficients, and so forth,\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess, and it's gonna be hard to figure out what what uh \nphd c: And \ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: I I I will include too the the the differential de derivates too.\ngrad b: Deltas,\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: yeah. So.\nprofessor d: I I mean, I think the other thing that one I mean, this is, I think a good thing to do, to sort of look at these things at least See what I 'd I 'd Let me tell you what I would do. I would take just a few features. Instead of taking all the MFCC's, or all the PLP's or whatever, I would just take a couple.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK? Like like C - one, C - two, something like that, so that you can visualize it.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK, so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers, just take a look in two dimensions, at how these things are split apart.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And the second thing is, once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers, @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties. So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time, you don't know anything about, you know, the structure of it over time, and so you may wanna build @ @ build a Markov model of some sort uh, or or else have features that really are based on um on on some bigger chunk of time.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Context window?\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: But I think this is a good place to start. But don't uh anyway, this is my suggestion, is don't just, you know, throw in twenty features at it, the deltas, and the delta del and all that into some classifier, even even if it's K - nearest - neighbors, you still won't know\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor d: what it's doing, even You know it's Uh, I think to know what it's to have a better feeling for what it's\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: look at at som some picture that shows you, \" Here's These things uh, uh are offer some separation. \" And, uh, in LPC, uh, the thing to particularly look at is, I think is something like, uh, the residual \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um So.\nphd c: Yeah. S\npostdoc e: Can I ask? It strikes me that there's another piece of information um, that might be useful and that's simply the transition. So, w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech, there's gonna be a b a big informative area there, it seems to me.\nphd c: Yeah, because Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I Yeah. But eh I I Is my my my own vision, of the of the project.\ngrad b: So, some sort of That's \npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: I eh the the Meeting Recorder project, for me, has eh, two eh, w has eh several parts, several p objective\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: eh, because it's a a great project. But eh, at the first, in the acoustic, eh, eh, parts of the project, eh I think you eh we have eh two main eh objective. One one of these is to eh to detect the change, the acoustic change. And for that, if you don't use, eh, eh, a speech recognizer, eh broad class, or not broad class to to try to to  to label the different frames, I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change.\npostdoc e: OK.\nphd c: And Probably. I I I I would like to to t prove. Uh, probably. When you you have, eh, eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone, this criterion is enough with  probably with, eh, this kind of, eh, eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal, regular eh parameter MF - MFCC. you you have to to to find you can find the the mark. You can find the nnn, the the acoustic change. But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify, to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file, that eh you have eh, but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone. because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model, I suppose.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: because it's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular, normal speech recognizer. That, you know, I I I think is the idea. And so eh the, nnn the  the system eh will have two models.\npostdoc e: Clustering.\nphd c: A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p uh, will be possible the, eh the mark, the change and another another model will @ @ or several models, to try s but eh several model eh robust models, sample models to try to classify the difference class.\npostdoc e: OK.\ngrad b: I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry, I didn't understand you what you said. What what model?\npostdoc e: \nphd c: Eh, the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize, eh with eh to transcribe, with eh a speech recognizer.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: And my idea is to use eh, for example, a neural net\npostdoc e: So p\nphd c: with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame. Eh for the difference zone\ngrad b: Features. Yeah.\nphd c: you you eh, eh have obtained in the first eh, step with the for example, BIC eh, eh criterion compare model\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: And You I don't - u\nprofessor d: OK, but, I I think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is \nphd c: i\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Because what we had before for for uh, speaker change detection did not include these overlaps.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Right? So again, I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh, in in in in \ngrad b: Features?\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Well, I again, the things you 've written up there I think are way too way too big.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK? If you 're talking about, say, twelfth twelfth - order uh MFCC's or something like that it's just way too much.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: You won't be able to look at it. All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Whereas I think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things, or three of you have some very fancy display, uh, and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out, you 'll have much more insight about what's going on.\nphd c: It will be enough.\nprofessor d: Well, you 'll you 'll get a feeling for what's happening, you know,\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: so if you look at Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second, and then you look at the third and there's not and not too much there, you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients,\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: right? And with LPC, I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other, maybe. Uh, and uh on the other hand, the LPC residual, the energy in the LPC residual, will say how well, uh the low - order LPC model's fitting it, which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time, and it should be pretty well, for w for for one.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: And so I i again, if you take a few of these things that are are prob um  promising features and look at them in pairs, uh, I think you 'll have much more of a sense of \" OK, I now have uh, doing a bunch of these analyses, I now have ten likely candidates. \" And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: I 've got a question.\nphd c: Yeah. This\npostdoc e: Interesting.\nphd c: Sorry.\npostdoc e: Hmm.\nphd c: but eh, eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that and I would eh like to to know what eh, your opinion. Eh all this study in the f in the first moment, I I w I I will pretend to do with eh eh equalizes speech. The the equalizes speech, the speech eh, the mixes of speech.\ngrad b: With \npostdoc e: With what? With what?\ngrad b: Right. Mixed.\nphd c: the the mix, mixed speech.\npostdoc e: \" Mixed \". Thank you.\nphd c: Eh, why? Because eh the spectral distortion is  more eh a lot eh clearer, very much clearer if we compare with the PDA.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: PDA speech file is eh it will be eh difficult. I \npostdoc e: So it's messier.\nphd c: Yeah,\npostdoc e: The the PDA is messier.\nphd c: fff! Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low.\nprofessor d: OK.\ngrad b: Yeah, I think that that's a good way to start.\nphd c: And, I don't know \ngrad b: But.\nphd c: I don't know eh uh i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech, the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files.\ngrad b: It would be interesting in itself to see. Well, I think that would be an interesting result.\nphd c: eh What, I I mean, what what is the effect of the low ' signal to to to noise relation, you know, eh with \nprofessor d: N u We Well, I think I think I think it's not a it's not at all unreasonable. It makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio, then there's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio, one would think, anyway.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And so, if you can get @ @ Uh again, my prescription would be that you would, with a mixed signal, you would take a collection of possible uh, features look at them, look at how these different classes that you 've marked, separate themselves, and then collect, uh in pairs, and then collect ten of them or something, and then proceed with a bigger classifier.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: And then if you can get that to work well, then you go to the other signal. And then, and you and you know, they won't work as well, but how m you know, how much \ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: And then you can re - optimize, and so on.\ngrad b: Yeah. But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both. Because it I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed, and And don't \nprofessor d: Hmm.\nphd c: Ah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah.\nprofessor d: That's well, the It it's it's true that it also, it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases. Sure.\nphd c: But \ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found, eh, eh worked with both eh, speech file,\npostdoc e: That's good.\nphd c: but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the, eh eh speech file the PDA speech files.\nprofessor d: Hmm.\nphd c: Yeah, I don't know.\nprofessor d: Right.\nphd c: But it I I I I think it will be important. Because eh people eh eh, different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem. Is eh is not easy eh to to solve, because if you I I I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA, and s some parts is very difficult because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram.\ngrad b: Right. Yeah, they 're totally hidden.\nphd c: Is very difficult to apply eh, eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Yeah. Well, that that that's another reason why very simple features, things like energy, and things things like harmonicity, and residual energy are uh, yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable.\nphd c: But I suppose \ngrad b: Are probably better, yep.\nphd c: Yeah, yeah yeah, I I I will put eh the energy here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess.\nphd c: You have a question.\nphd a: Yeah, I maybe this is a dumb question, but w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA\nprofessor d: Nah.\nphd a: because can't you, couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps? I mean \ngrad b: Well, if you used the array, rather than the signal from just one.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor d: Yeah, no, you you 're you 're right\ngrad b: But that's \nprofessor d: that In fact, if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones, you do have some location information. which we don't have with the one and and so that's \nphd a: Is that not allowed with this project?\nprofessor d: Uh, well, no, I mean, we we don't have any rules, r really.\nphd a: But I didn't mean I w Given given the goal.\nprofessor d: I think I I think I think it's it's it's a it's an additional interesting question.\nphd a: I mean, is is that violation of the \nphd c: Oh. No. Yeah.\nprofessor d: I mean, I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one, because you know it's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two.\nphd a: Mm - hmm\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh, if, on the other hand, we show that there's a huge advantage with two, well then that could be a real point.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: But, we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is. You know, maybe it doesn't matter too much.\nphd a: Right. Right. OK.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: So, this is all pretty early stages.\nphd a: I see.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor d: But no, you 're absolutely right. That's a good thing to consider.\nphd a: OK.\npostdoc e: There there is a complication though, and that is if a person turns their back to the to the PDA, then some of the positional information goes away?\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Well, it it it does, i it d it does, but the the the issue is that that \nphd a: No, it's not it's not that so much as \npostdoc e: And then, And if they 're on the access  on the axis of it, that was the other thing I was thinking.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: He You mentioned this last time, that that if if you 're straight down the midline, then then the r the left - right's gonna be different,\ngrad b: Yeah, we hav need to put it on a little turntable,\nphd c: I I I I I th\ngrad b: and \nphd a: Well, it's\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: and and and in his case, I mean, he's closer to it anyway.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\npostdoc e: It seems to me that that it's not a p uh, you know, it's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated.\ngrad b: But it's another source of information.\nphd c: I I Yeah.\nphd a: I don't I don't know ho\nphd c: I I I think Sorry. I I I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh, microphone, eh, in the PDA is very near. But it's uh from my opinion, it's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural eh problem eh, with information, because I I found difference between the the speech from from each micro eh, in the PDA.\nphd a: I would guess \ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: Yeah, it's timing difference. It - it's not amplitude,\npostdoc e: Oh yeah! Oh I agree! And we use it ourselves.\nprofessor d: right? S Right.\npostdoc e: I mean, I know I n I know that's a very important cue.\ngrad b: Yep.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table, is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA,\nphd c: No. No. No, no, no.\npostdoc e: so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker.\nprofessor d: That's That's fine.\nphd a: But th I don't think that matters, though.\nphd c: But \nprofessor d: That's So so i @ @ I think the issue is, \" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction? \"\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor d: If it's not coming from just one direction, if it if th if there's a broader pattern, it means that it's more likely there's multiple people speaking,\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: wherever they are.\nphd a: So it's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is.\nprofessor d: Is it a is it \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah, is there a narrow Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern? So if there's a distributed beam pattern, then it looks more like it's it's uh, multiple people.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Wherever you are, even if he moves around.\npostdoc e: OK. Yeah. OK, it just it just seemed to me that uh, that this isn't the ideal type of separation. I mean, I I think it's I can see the value o\nprofessor d: Oh, ideal would be to have the wall filled with them, but I mean But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan's page, it was When when there were two people speaking, and it looked really really different.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Yeah, OK.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad b: Yep.\npostdoc e: Oh yeah yeah. OK.\nphd a: What looked different?\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh, well, basic he was looking at correlation.\ngrad b: Cross - co cross - correlation.\nphd c: Correlation, yeah.\nprofessor d: Just cross - correlation between two sides.\nphd a: Did - Sorry, b uh I 'm not sure what Dan's page is that you mean. He was looking at the two \nprofessor d: So cross - correlation is pretty sensitive.\npostdoc e: Uh, his a web page.\nprofessor d: You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags.\ngrad b: Subtract them.\nphd a: OK.\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: And you find They get peaks.\nprofessor d: OK. So when one person is speaking, then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking, then there's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag.\nphd a: OK. OK.\nprofessor d: So if at whatever angle you are, at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there, you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function.\nphd a: So so if there's two \ngrad b: And if there are multiple people talking, you 'll see two peaks.\nprofessor d: It's spread out.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Well, let me ask you, if if both people were over there, it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across, catty - corner?\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah. The - the Oh, I 'm sorry,\npostdoc e: No?\nprofessor d: if they 're right next to one another?\nphd a: If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking, it wouldn't work.\nprofessor d: i i\npostdoc e: Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: There we go. Good example, the same one I 'm asking.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah, e I see.\nphd a: Yes.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Versus you versus you know, and we 're catty - corner across the table, and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one.\ngrad b: Or or even if, like, if people were sitting right across from each other, you couldn't tell the difference either.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Oh, yeah.\npostdoc e: It seems like that would be pretty strong.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Across the same axis, you don't have as much to differentiate.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Well, we d yeah, we don't have a third dimension there. Yeah, so it's \npostdoc e: And so my point was just that it's it's gonna be differentially differentially varia valuable.\ngrad b: Right.\npostdoc e: I mean, it's not to say I mean, I certainly think it's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know, these these binaural cues.\nphd c: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor d: But it's almost but it's almost a I think what you 're talking about i there's two things.\npostdoc e: But.\ngrad b: Must do. Yeah.\nprofessor d: There's a sensitivity issue, and then there's a pathological error uh issue. So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error.\npostdoc e: Yes. Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it.\npostdoc e: OK. and i and if there So it And if it's the two of you guys on the same side \nprofessor d: Uh, if they 're if they 're close, it's just a question of the sensitivity.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor d: So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough, uh, experience with it to know how \npostdoc e: Yeah. OK. Yeah yeah, OK. Yeah.\ngrad b: But \nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it, by any means. I just wanted to point out that that weakness, that it's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: And I think Dan is still working on it. So. He actually he wrote me about it a little bit, so.\npostdoc e: Great. No, I don't mean to discourage that at all.\nprofessor d: I mean, the other thing you can do uh, if I mean, i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA. But if you h put a third in, you could put in the other axis. And then you know then you 're sort of Yeah, then then you pretty much could cover \nphd a: Once you got two \npostdoc e: Interesting.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Well what about just doing it from these mikes?\npostdoc e: Interesting.\nphd a: You know?\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Yep.\nphd c: It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the the the separation I I think \nprofessor d: Uh @ @ But - but that's I mean, we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study.\ngrad b: Then they 're much broader. Yeah, we can do whatever we want.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: But but but the thing is, uh, one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA.\ngrad b: Whatever you 're interested in.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: That's what I was asking about, what are the constraints?\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Right. Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Well, that's that's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were were were interested in.\ngrad b: Well \nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Yep.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh, but you know if you can instrument a room, this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing, right? Some people at at uh, yeah, at Brown and and and and at uh um and at Cape,\ngrad b: Big micro @ @ arrays.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Didn't they have something at Cape?\nprofessor d: they both have these, you know, big arrays on the wall. And you know, if you could do that, you 've got microphones all over the place\ngrad b: Very finely.\nprofessor d: uh, you know p tens of microphones, and and uh \nphd a: Oh! I saw a demo.\nphd c: Oh, right, oh, yeah.\nprofessor d: And if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity \nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad b: Oh, I saw one that was like a hundred microphones, a ten by ten array.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: And you could In a noisy room, they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody.\nphd c: Hundred.\ngrad b: And they had very precision.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: Very complex, uh Yeah.\nprofessor d: Ye - Pretty much. Yeah.\ngrad b: It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it.\nphd a: That is cool.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: It was yeah, it was interesting.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: But, the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um, I 'm interested in what happens for people, random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion. And you can't just always go, \" well, let's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up \".\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: No, what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA.\npostdoc e: Interesting.\ngrad b: But I think \nprofessor d: The other thing actually, that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do, is what happens if you have two P D\ngrad b: Yep.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: and they communicate with each other? And then You know, they 're in random positions, the likelihood that I mean, basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls, if you even had two. If you had three or four it's Yeah.\nphd a: Ooo!\ngrad b: That's on my web pages.\nphd a: Network!\ngrad b: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Interesting.\ngrad b: Though All sorts of interesting things you can do with that,\npostdoc e: Interesting.\ngrad b: I mean, not only can you do microphone arrays, but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well.\npostdoc e: Hmm.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: So it's it would be neat.\npostdoc e: Ah!\nphd a: I still like my rug on the wall idea, so if anybody patents that, then \ngrad b: But I think \npostdoc e: Well, you could have strips that you stick to your clothing.\ngrad b: in terms of \nphd a: Yeah!\ngrad b: Yeah.\nphd a: Hats?\ngrad b: In terms of the research th research, it's really it's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do.\nphd a: Shirts.\ngrad b: So if if Jose is interested in that, that's great. But if if he's not, that's great too.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Um, I i I i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down, see if we can still get to the end of the, uh, birthdays thing there.\ngrad b: Catch some tea? Um.\nprofessor d: So\ngrad b: Well, I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out.\nprofessor d: OK.\ngrad b: One is, do we need to sign new these again?\npostdoc e: Well, it's slightly different. So I I would say it would be a good idea.\nphd a: Are they new?\npostdoc e: Cuz it it's slightly different.\ngrad b: Yep.\nphd a: Oh.\nprofessor d: Oh, this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already, we didn't have to.\ngrad b: Yeah, I I should 've checked with Jane first, but the ch the form has changed.\npostdoc e: It's slightly different.\ngrad b: So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form.\nprofessor d: Ah - oh.\nphd c: OK.\ngrad b: Um, I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing.\npostdoc e: I had to make one \ngrad b: But, if we 're in a hurry, we can put that off. Um and then also anonymity, how we want to anonymize the data. Uh.\npostdoc e: Well, should I I mean I have some results to present, but I mean I guess we won't have time to do that this time. But it seems like um the anonymization is uh, is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length.\nprofessor d: Um. I mean, wha what \npostdoc e: If if we 're about to wind down, I think what I would prefer is that we uh, delay the anonymization thing till next week, and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps.\nphd a: We still have to do this, too, right?\nprofessor d: Right.\nphd a: Digits?\nprofessor d: Right.\ngrad b: No - well, we don't have to do digits.\nprofessor d: Well, why don't we Uh, so @ @ OK. @ @ It sounds like u uh, there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about. Why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them, and then and then and then and then and then we \ngrad b: OK, go ahead, Jane.\npostdoc e: I 'd Oh, I 'd prefer to have more time for my results. e Could I do that next week maybe?\nprofessor d: OK. Oh, yeah. Sure.\npostdoc e: OK, that's what I 'm asking.\nprofessor d: Oh yeah, yeah.\npostdoc e: And I think the anonymization, if y if you want to proceed with that now, I just think that that's that's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know, more that just a minute.\nprofessor d: We could s\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: I really do think that, because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself, you and I have discussed it previously, and there are different ways that people approach it, e and I think we should \ngrad b: Alright. We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now, before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it\npostdoc e: Well, OK.\ngrad b: going and dealing with it.\npostdoc e: It's just Yeah. OK. I I 'll give you the short version, but I do think it's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: OK, so the the short thing is um, we have uh, tape recording uh, uh, sorry, digitized recor recordings. Those we won't be able to change. If someone says \" Hey, Roger so - and - so \".\ngrad b: Right.\npostdoc e: So that's gonna stay that person's name.\ngrad b: Yep.\npostdoc e: Now, in terms of like the transcript, the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody's name, and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says \" Hey Roger \" or are we gonna put that person's anonymized name in instead?\ngrad b: No, because then that would give you a mapping, and you don't wanna have a mapping.\npostdoc e: OK, so first decision is, we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned.\nphd a: I don't \ngrad b: No. Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker's real name and the tag we 're using, and we don't want \npostdoc e: I I don't think you understood what I what I said.\ngrad b: OK.\npostdoc e: So uh, so in within the context of an utterance, someone says \" So, Roger, what do you think? \" OK. Then, uh, it seems to me that Well, maybe I uh it seems to me that if you change the name, the transcript's gonna disagree with the audio, and you won't be able to use that.\nphd a: Right, you don't wanna do that.\ngrad b: We don't we wanna we ha we want the transcript to be \" Roger \".\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad b: Because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger, someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name, and we wanna avoid that.\npostdoc e: OK, well, but then there's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing, then and, you know, Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who's who's the addressee and all, then to have \" Roger \" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was \" Roger \" be \" Frank \", that's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis.\ngrad b: Oh. Ugh! That's a good point.\npostdoc e: Now, if you want to, you know, I mean, in some cases, I I I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers, uh, actually did do uh, um, a filter of the s signal where the person's name was mentioned, except\nprofessor d: Yeah Yeah, once you get to the publication you can certainly do that.\npostdoc e: And and I cer and I So, I mean, the question then becomes one level back. Um, how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name? Well, on the one hand, uh, it's not a full identity, we 're taking all these precautions, um and they 'll be taking precautions, which are probably even the more important ones, to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts, to see if there's something they don't like  OK. So, maybe, uh, maybe that's enough protection. On the other hand, this is a small this is a small pool, and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field, they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name. However, taking one step further back, they 'd be identifiable anyway, even if we changed all the names.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: Mmm.\npostdoc e: So, is it really, um  You know?\ngrad b: Ugh!\npostdoc e: Now, in terms of like so I I did some results, which I 'll report on n next time, which do mention individual speakers by name.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: Now, there, the Human Subjects Committee is very precise. You don't wanna mention subjects by name in published reports. Now, it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study, and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication. And someone who looked \nprofessor d: You can go, you know, uh, \" Z \" uh, for instance.\npostdoc e: Yeah, exactly. Doesn't matter if \nprofessor d: Uh. Um, yeah, I mean, t it doesn't I mean, I 'm not knowledgeable about this, but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone's first name in in the in the transcript.\npostdoc e: That's the same thing you saw.\ngrad b: OK. \nprofessor d: Uh, I think you don't wanna have their full name to be uh, listed.\npostdoc e: Yeah, and and in the form that they sign, it does say \" your first name may arise in the course of the meetings \".\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And so \nphd a: Well \nprofessor d: Yeah. So again, th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things, you know, if someone says, uh, uh, \" Frank said this \" and then you wanna connect it to something later, you 've gotta have this part where that's \" Frank colon \".\npostdoc e: Or \" your name \".\ngrad b: Yeah, shoot!\nprofessor d: Right?\npostdoc e: Yeah, and and you know, even more i i uh, immediate than that just being able to, uh Well, it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who's speaking and who's speaking to whom, cuz that can be important.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: S i You know, \" You raised the point, So - and - so \", it's be kind of nice to be able to know who \" you \" was.\ngrad b: Shoot!\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: I I 'm thinking too much.\npostdoc e: And ac and actually you remember furthermore, you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know, I was sort of avoiding mentioning people's names,\nprofessor d: Yeah, I was too. Yeah.\npostdoc e: and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial. Well, I mean, if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people's names in the transcript, we 've basically done something one step worse.\ngrad b: Yep. Well, I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript,\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: but that's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse, and so I think that's a really good point.\npostdoc e: Misleading.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: You 're right, this is going to require more thought.\nprofessor d: Yeah. L let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the, uh, what we 're covering in the meeting. Uh I realize when you 're doing this that uh I mean, I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about. Uh, and so, uh and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random, frankly. So I think what would be helpful would be uh, i and I 'll I 'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too, that um, before the meeting if anybody could send me, any any, uh, uh, agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll I 'll take the role of organizing them uh, into into the agenda,\npostdoc e: OK. Sure.\nprofessor d: but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda. I 've no desire to to make it up, but if if no one's told me things, then I 'm just proceeding from my my guesses, and and uh, and i ye yeah, I I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to I mean, I 'm just always asking Jose what he's doing, you know, and and so it's  There's uh, there's obviously other things going on.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: Oh, it's not a problem. Not a problem. Yeah. I just I just couldn't do it in two minutes.\ngrad b: How will we how would the person who's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about? Do you know what I 'm saying?\nphd a: \" The person who's doing the transcript \" The IBM people?\ngrad b: Yeah. I mean, so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway?\npostdoc e: How do you mean, who what they 're who they 're talking about?\ngrad b: I mean, so if I 'm saying in a meeting, \" oh and Bob, by the way, wanted wanted to do so - and - so \",\npostdoc e: How do you mean?\nphd a: They 're just gonna write \" Bob \" on it or do @ @ \ngrad b: if you 're doing Yeah, @ @ they 're just gonna write \" Bob \". And so. If you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis,\npostdoc e: They won't be able to change it themselves.\nprofessor d: What ar how are they gonna do any of this?\ngrad b: Yeah, really.\npostdoc e: Well, I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them.\nprofessor d: I mean, they 're gonna say speaker - one, or speaker - two or speaker I mean I I \nphd a: They can't do that.\nphd c: Yeah, I think \ngrad b: Well, the current one they don't do speaker identity.\nphd c: \ngrad b: because in NaturallySpeaking, or, excuse me, in ViaVoice, it's only one person. and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions.\nprofessor d: So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words.\ngrad b: Yep.\npostdoc e: Oh. I think that My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching? Is that how you pronounce her name?\nprofessor d: Uh Yu - Ching, Yu - Ching. Yeah.\npostdoc e: Oh, uh Yu - Ching? Yu - Ching?\ngrad b: y Yu - Ching.\npostdoc e: was that um, they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed, where they put speaker identifier down. But, you know, h they won't know these people, so I think it's Well, they 'll they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them So they 'll do something like speaker - one, speaker - two, is what I bet, but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers. We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case.\nprofessor d: And it and it may very well be I mean, since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about, uh, it being the same speaker, they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker, that 'll be speaker - two.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it's actually speaker - one.\npostdoc e: You know Uh - huh. You know, that would be a very practical solution on their part.\nphd c: Yeah. It's a good idea.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\npostdoc e: And and but then we would need to label it.\ngrad b: Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah, I think \npostdoc e: And that's OK.\nphd c: \npostdoc e: Yes, I was thinking, the temp the time values of when it changes.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: So. But I mean that doesn't This doesn't answer the the question.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: But that \npostdoc e: That 'd be very efficient.\ngrad b: The p It's a good point, \" which what do you do for discourse tracking? \"\nphd c: Because y y you don't know to know, eh you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers. You only eh want to know \ngrad b: Hmm. For for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do.\nprofessor d: Well, you do.\nphd c: Ah, for discourse, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah. If if if if someone says, uh, \" what what is Jose doing? \" and then Jose says something, you need to know that that was Jose responding.\nphd c: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah,\ngrad b: Ugh, that's a problem.\nprofessor d: Uh, so.\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name, which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit.\nphd a: That would be hard.\npostdoc e: Well, people are very flexible. You know? I mean, so when we did this las last week, I felt that you know, now, Andreas may, uh, @ @ uh, he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something, and and because he missed something, then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about, and was was unable to do the tracking.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name. So, people are really flexible.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: But, you know, like, at the beginning of this meeting Or, you I think said, you know, or s Liz, said something about um, uh, \" is Mari gonna use the equipment? \" I mean, how would you say that?\npostdoc e: Yeah?\nphd a: I mean, you have to really think, you know, about what you 're saying bef\ngrad b: if you wanted to anonymize.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah, is \nprofessor d: \" Is you know who up in you know where? \"\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Right? Use the \nphd a: I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names, plus we 'd have to tell everybody else.\ngrad b: Yeah, darn! I mean, what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names.\npostdoc e: Well, it\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: but then, again that kills your discourse analysis.\nphd a: Right.\npostdoc e: Uh - huh.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad b: Ugh!\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\nphd a: I I think the I think I don't know, my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what's in the recordings, you only anonymize to the extent you can, the speakers have signed the forms and all.\npostdoc e: That's that's the issue.\ngrad b: Well, but that but that as I said, that that that works great for the acoustics, but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse.\npostdoc e: Well.\nphd a: Why?\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Because you don't have a map of who's talking versus their name that they 're being referred to.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Th - Bec\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one, speaker - two \ngrad b: Sure but, h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and \nphd a: Why do you have to know his name?\nprofessor d: OK, so suppose someone says, \" well I don't know if I really heard what uh, what Jose said. \"\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And then, Jose responds.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it. But it doesn't say \" Jose \", it says \" speaker - five \".\nphd a: OK.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: So uh u\nphd a: Oh, I see, you wanna associated the word \" Jose \" in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded.\nprofessor d: Right.\ngrad b: Someone who's doing discourse would wanna do that.\nprofessor d: And so, if we pass out the data to someone else, and it says \" speaker - five \" there, we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose,\ngrad b: And that violates our privacy.\nprofessor d: and if were gonna do that we might as well give them \" Jose \" say it was \" Jose \".\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad b: And that violates our privacy issue.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Now, I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data, which is the one which is o our use, University of Washington's use, IBM, SRI.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\npostdoc e: And within that, it may be that it's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet, but always, always in the publications we have to.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc e: And I think also, when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world, we have to. But I but I don that's that's a long way from now and and it's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how \ngrad b: Making some decisions?\npostdoc e: i i it You know, it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um the audio, and just put in brackets \" speaker - one \".\ngrad b: Yeah. For the public one.\nphd c: the??\ngrad b: You know, what we could do also is have more than one version of release.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc e: You know.\ngrad b: One that's public and one one that requires licensing. And so the licensed one would w we could it would be a sticky limitation.\npostdoc e: Uh - huh.\ngrad b: You know, like Well, we can talk about that later.\npostdoc e: I think that's risky. I think that the public should be the same. I think that when we do that world release, it should be the same.\nprofessor d: I I agree. I I agree with Jane.\npostdoc e: For a bunch of reasons, legal.\nprofessor d: I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort, and \npostdoc e: But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important.\nphd a: Well, one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um For example, the people who are funding this work, they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it's not longer useful for discourse, you know \ngrad b: Well, depending on how much editing we do, you might be able to still have it useful. because for discourse you don't need the audio. Right? So you could bleep out the names in the audio.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: and use the anonymized one through the transcript.\nphd a: But if you release both \nprofessor d: Uh.\npostdoc e: Excuse me. We we do need audio for discourse.\ngrad b: But, n excuse me, but you could bleep out just the names.\nprofessor d: She No, but she's saying, from the argument before, she wants to be able to say if someone said \" Jose \" in their in their thing, and then connect to so to what he said later, then you need it.\ngrad b: Right. But in the transcript, you could say, everywhere they said \" Jose \" that you could replace it with \" speaker - seven \".\nprofessor d: Oh I see. I see.\npostdoc e: Yeah. But I  I also wanna say that people \ngrad b: And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore. But it would be still useful for the \npostdoc e: Uh - huh.\nphd a: But if both of those are publically available \npostdoc e: Yeah. That's good.\ngrad b: But they Right.\nprofessor d: And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here, what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue,\npostdoc e: Well, you see? So, it's complicated.\nprofessor d: and so, uh,\npostdoc e: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor d: yeah. Sorry.\npostdoc e: I think we have to think about w @ @ how. I think that this can't be decided today.\ngrad b: Yeah, OK, good point.\npostdoc e: But it's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms, but I guess it is.\nphd c: OK.\nprofessor d: OK. Yeah, a lot of these things are.\ngrad b: Discourse.\npostdoc e: Well it Discourse, you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript.\ngrad b: Yeah, ab absolutely. Oh, yeah, sure.\npostdoc e: It's gonna be looking at a t You know, and prosod prosodic stuff is involved, and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio, and then you come directly into this confronting this problem.\nphd a: Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse,\npostdoc e: So.\nphd a: and then, we wouldn't have to worry about it.\nphd c: OK.\npostdoc e: Yeah, we should just market it to non - English speaking countries.\nphd c: OK.\nprofessor d: Uh, maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name.\ngrad b: Did you read the paper on Eurospeech?\npostdoc e: We could have little labels. I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again, which is everyone has like \" Mister White \", \" Mister Pink \", \" Mister Blue \".\nphd a: Mister White.\ngrad b: Yeah. Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables? They were di they they had the utterances. and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards.\nphd a: But so, the syllables were in the same order, with respect to each other, but the acous\ngrad b: Everything was in the same order, but they were the individual syll syllables were played backwards. And you could listen to it, and it would sound the same.\nphd a: What did it sound like?\ngrad b: People had no difficulty in interpreting it. So what we need is something that's the reverse, that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it.\nprofessor d: Oh, well that's there's an easy way to do that. Jus - jus just play it all backwards.\ngrad b: Oh right. The speech recognizer's totally symmetric, isn't it.\nprofessor d: What, what does the speech recognizer care?\ngrad b: Ah, anyway.\nprofessor d: Um,\npostdoc e: Oh, do we do digits? Or? What do we do?\ngrad b: Uh OK, we 'll quickly do digits.\nprofessor d: Let's do digits. Yeah, we we we already missed the party.\npostdoc e: Or do we just quit?\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor d: So.\npostdoc e: Yeah.\ngrad b: OK, go off here.\nphd a: I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations. like as if you were talking like, \" nine eight six eight seven? \"\npostdoc e: Well, you know, in the in the one I transcribed, I did find a couple instances  I found one instance of contrastive stress, where it was like the string had a li So it was like \" nine eight two four, nine nine two four \".\nphd a: Oh, really. So they were like looking ahead,\npostdoc e: And \nphd a: huh?\npostdoc e: Well, they differed. I mean, at that that session I did feel like they did it more as sentences. But, um, sometimes people do it as phone numbers. I mean, I 've I am sort of interested in in And sometimes, you know, I s And I I never know. When I do it, I I ask myself what I 'm doing each time.\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad b: Yep.\nphd a: Well, I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this\npostdoc e: and I \nphd a: They may as well throw in some interesting intonations.\ngrad b: Well, except,\npostdoc e: I like your question intonation.\ngrad b: yeah.\npostdoc e: That's very funny. I haven't heard that one.\ngrad b: We have the transcript. We have the actual numbers they 're reading, so we 're not necessarily depending on that.

So.\ngrad b: another type of meeting.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: Right.\nphd c: But I I I think you need, uh, another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do, eh, more e easier the recording process, eh, out from ICSI.\nphd f: Right.\ngrad b: Hmm.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd c: Eh and probably. I don't know.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd c: Eh, if you you want to to record, eh, a seminar or a class, eh, in the university, you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put, eh, a lot of, eh, head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with, eh, this kind of, eh, d device.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad b: Yeah, but I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones, that's easy.\nphd c: Oh - yeah.\ngrad b: Right? That's very easy,\nphd c: Ye - Yeah, yeah.\ngrad b: but that's not the corpus that we 're collecting.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Actually, that's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that's maybe worth repeating. We realized that, um, when we were talking about this that, OK, there's these different things that we want to do with it. So, um, it's true that we wanna be selective in some ways, uh, the way that you were speaking about with, uh, not having an interlingua and uh, these other issues. But on the other hand, it's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it. So, a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that's done with a small n recorded with a small, uh, typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that's, uh, just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that's OK too. Uh, i We realized in discussion that the other thing is, what about this business of distant and close microphones? I mean, we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way, that's why we did it. But what about For th for these issues of summarization, a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone.\nphd f: Right, I mean, I c I think there's \ngrad b: And you don't really need the close microphone, you mean.\nprofessor d: You actually don't.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: Yea - yeah yeah, you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone.\npostdoc e: Which one did you mean?\nprofessor d: You d You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone, somewhere.\ngrad b: Ye - Yeah. Yep.\nphd f: You can use found data.\ngrad b: Tape recorder.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\npostdoc e: Oh.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: You you can.\nprofessor d: You need some microphone,\nphd f: You can\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: but I mean \nphd f: use Um, but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect,\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd f: you know, each person who's interested in I mean, we have a cou we have a bunch of different, um, slants and perspectives on what it's useful for, um, they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want.\nprofessor d: Right.\nphd f: And So in my case, um, I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others.\ngrad b: Not enough for others, right.\nphd f: And so I 'm looking and thinking, \" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it's to help th in my interest. \"\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: And other people need to do that for themselves, uh, h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal \nprofessor d: Right.

For some of it.\nprofessor d: Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that's good enough to get a uh, a transcription from later, you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording.\nphd f: Right.\ngrad b: Yep.", "en_query": "What did the group say on portable equipment?", "zh_query": "该团队对便携式设备有什么看法？", "fr_query": "Qu'a dit le groupe sur les équipements portables ?", "ukr_query": "Що сказала група про портативне обладнання?", "en_summary": "The group wanted to introduce portable equipment so as to get more meetings from different groups.

OK.\ngrad c: OK? Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML, about what we have done here and so of course, I 'm I 'm gonna start out with this slide, so the most relevant aspects of our stay here, and um, then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning The Cave Forty - Five is a is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that that time. And so\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad c: they 're supposed to imagine that, you know, do they think the person wants to go there, or just know where it is? Uh, which is probably not, uh, the case in that discotheque example, or in the Bavaria example, you just want to know where it is. And so forth. So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it's nine nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be, for example, one that might ask for directions instead of just location. Um, and so forth and so forth. That's sort of motivating it. Then what have we done so far? We had our little bit of, um, um, SmartKom stuff, that we did, um, everth\ngrad f: Oh, you 've got the parser done. Sorry.\ngrad c: That's the not the construction parser. That's the, uh, tablet - based parser,\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad a: Easy parser.\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad c: and the generation outputter.\ngrad d: Halfway done? Yeah.\ngrad c: That's done.\ngrad a: Mmm.\ngrad c: You have to change those strategies,\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad c: right? That's, ten words?\ngrad d: Yeah. Well, i it, you know. Maybe twelve.\ngrad c: Twelve? OK. And, um, and Fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak. That's all about that. Then I 'm going to talk about the data, you know these things about uh, actually I have an example, probably. Two s Can you hear that? Or should I turn the l volume on.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: I could hear it.\ngrad d: I I can hear it.\ngrad f: I heard it.\ngrad d: They might not hear it in the well maybe they will. I don't know.\ngrad a: This was an actual, um, subject? Ah.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Sounds like Fey.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad c: But they 're they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer,\ngrad f: Oh, OK.\ngrad c: the you can observe that all the time, they 're trying to match their prosody onto the machine.\ngrad f: Oh really. Interesting. Oh, it's pretty slow.\ngrad c: Yeah, you have to \ngrad a: Wh\ngrad f: The system breaking.\ngrad a: What is the s? Oh!\ngrad c: OK. And so forth and so forth. Um, I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing, and how we solved it, and some preliminary observations, also, um, I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz, but I thought it would interesting to, uh, um, point out that it's basically the same. Um, as in every human - human telephone conversation, and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from, uh, some first, uh, observations. Then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz, uh how to get there, what actually is happening there today, and then maybe talk about the big picture here, e tell a little bit as much as I can about the NTL story. I I wa I do wanna, um I 'm not quite sure about this, whether I should put this in, um, that, you know, you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works, and then, talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude, I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy. And, um, Srini was gonna send me some slides but he didn't do it, so from but I have the paper, I can make a resume of that, and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think.\ngrad a: Oh. I was like, \" where 'd you get that? \" OK.\ngrad f: Yeah, that looks familiar.\ngrad a: \" Looks familiar. \"\ngrad c: I think that's Bergen, Chang, something, or the other.\ngrad a: Uh.\nprofessor e: Whatever.\ngrad a: OK.\ngrad c: Um, and that's now I 'm not going to bring that. So that's basically what I have, so far, and the rest is for airplanes. So X - schemas, then, I would like to do talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes - net.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: End of story. Anything I forgot that we should mention? Oh, maybe the FMRI stuff. Should I mention the fact that, um, we 're also actually started going to start to look at people's brains in a more direct way?\nprofessor e: You certainly can. I mean I y I you know, I don't know \ngrad a: You might just wanna like, tack that on, as a comment, to something.\nprofessor e: Right, um.\ngrad c: \" Future activities \" something.\nprofessor e: Well, the time to mention it, if you mention it, is when you talk about mirror neurons, then you should talk about the more recent stuff, about the kicking\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: and, you know, the yeah, yeah and that the plan is to see to what extent the you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this, so that \ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: and that we 're planning to do this, um, which, we are. So that's one thing. Um. Depends. I mean, there is a, um, whole language learning story, OK?\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: which, uh, actually, i i even on your five - layer slide, you you 've got an old one that that leaves that off.\ngrad c: Yeah, I I I do have it here.\ngrad a: Hmm.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: Um. And, of course, you know, the the big picture is this bit.\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad c: But, you know, it would But I don't think I I am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter. I mean, there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works, so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know, it would be nice to tell people how what's happening there, plus how the, uh, language learning stuff works,\nprofessor e: OK, so, so anyway, I I agree that's not central.\ngrad c: but \ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: What you might wanna do is, um, and may not, but you might wanna this is rip off a bunch of the slides on the anal there the there we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis, and matching to the underlying image schemas, and, um, how the construction and simulation that ho that whole th\ngrad c: Yeah, th that that's c that comes up to the X - schema slide,\ngrad a: OK, right.\ngrad c: so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy,\ngrad a: OK, I can give you a more recent if you want \ngrad c: one of Nancy's st\ngrad a: well, that might have enough.\ngrad c: Uh, I yeah, but I also have stuff you trash you left over,\nprofessor e: OK.\ngrad c: your quals and your triple - AI.\nprofessor e: The quals w the the the quals slides would be fine.\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: You could get it out of there, or some\ngrad a: Which I can even email you then, you know, like there probably was a little few changes, not a big deal. Yeah, you could steal anything you want, I don't care. Which you 've already done, obviously. So. Sorry\ngrad c: Well, I I don't feel bad about it at all\ngrad a: No, you shouldn't.\ngrad c: because because you are on the, uh, title.\ngrad a: Oh, that's great, that's great.\ngrad c: I mean on the the, you 're that's see, that's you.\ngrad a: I 'm glad to see propagation.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad a: Mmm.\ngrad c: Hmm? Propagated?\ngrad a: Yes.\ngrad c: I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig, so.\ngrad a: It's it's certainly related, um,\ngrad c: Because, um, EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig.\ngrad a: might wanna say. Is it?\ngrad c: So it It's on biocomputation. Would \nprofessor e: Yeah, it's different, this is the, uh, DNA building, or someth the double helix building.\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad a: Kind of a different level of analysis.\nprofessor e: The yeah it was it turns out that if if you have multiple billions of dollars, y you can do all sorts of weird things, and \ngrad d: Wait, they 're building a building in the shape of DNA,\ngrad a: What?\ngrad d: is that what you said?\nprofessor e: Roughly, yeah.\ngrad f: Oh! Oh boy!\ngrad a: O\nprofessor e: Including cr cross - bridges,\ngrad a: What?\nprofessor e: and\ngrad a: Oh my god!\ngrad f: That's brilliant! Hhh.\nprofessor e: You d you really now I I spent the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story which is, um \ngrad a: Of what\ngrad d: Y You definitely wanna w don't wanna waste that money on research,\ngrad a: the building?\ngrad d: you know?\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad d: That's horrible.\nprofessor e: Right. Well, no, no, y i there's infinite money. See you th you th you then fill it with researchers.\ngrad a: And give them more money. They just want a fun place for them to to work.\nprofessor e: Right. Right.\ngrad f: And everybody gets a trampoline in their office.\ngrad c: Well, the the offices are actually a little the, think of um, ramps, coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes, glass half - domes, and the offices are in in the glass half - dome.\ngrad a: Really?\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Alright, let's stop talking about this.\ngrad a: Does it exist yet?\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad a: They are w now building it?\ngrad c: Uh, as a model.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad c: But I th\nprofessor e: So, yeah, I think that's that's a good point, th th that the date, the, uh, a lot of the this is interacting with, uh, people in Italy but also definitely the people in Leipzig and the the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys, yeah. OK. OK. Anyway! Enough of that, let's talk about your thesis proposal.\ngrad c: Yeah, if somebody has something to say.\nprofessor e: Yep.\ngrad f: You might want to, uh, double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references, you had a few, uh, misspells in your slides, there. Like I believe you had \" Jackendorf \".\nprofessor e: Um.\ngrad f: Uh, unless there's a person called \" Jackendorf \",\ngrad a: On that one?\nprofessor e: No, no, no.\ngrad f: yeah. But that's the only thing I noticed in there.\ngrad a: In the presentation?\ngrad f: In the presentation.\ngrad a: I 'll probably I c might have I 'll probably have comments for you separately, not important. Anyway.\ngrad c: Oh, in the presentation here.\ngrad a: Yeah, that's what he was talking about.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad c: I was ac actually worried about bibtex. Uh. No, that's quite possible. That's copy and paste from something.\nprofessor e: So I did note i i it looks like the, uh, metaphor didn't get in yet.\ngrad c: Uh, it did, there is a reference to Srini \nprofessor e: Well, s reference is one thing, the question is is there any place Oh, did you put in something about,\ngrad a: Metonymy and metaphor here, right?\nprofessor e: uh, the individual, we 'd talked about putting in something about people had, uh Oh yeah, OK. Good. I see where you have it. So the top of the second of pa page two you have a sentence.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: But, what I meant is, I think even before you give this, to Wahlster, uh, you should, unless you put it in the text, and I don't think it's there yet, about we talked about is the, um, scalability that you get by, um, combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism. Is that in there?\ngrad c: Yeah, mmm. Um.\nprofessor e: Uh, OK, so where where is it, cuz I 'll have to take a look.\ngrad c: Um, but I I did not focus on that aspect but, um Ehhh, um, it's just underneath, uh, um, that reference to metaphor. So it's the last paragraph before two. So on page two, um, the main focus \nprofessor e: Uh, OK. Yeah.\ngrad c: But that's really \ngrad a: That's not about that, is it?\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: No, it it it s says it but it doesn't say it doesn't it d it d\ngrad c: Why.\nprofessor e: yeah, it doesn't give the punch line.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is, because it's actually important, which is, that, the constructions, that, uh, Nancy and Keith and friends are doing, uh, are, in a way, quite general but cover only base cases. And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things, requires this additional mechanism, of construal. And the punch line is, he claimed, that if you do this right, you can get essentially orthogonality, that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level, it should com uh, interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: And, similarly, if you introduce a new metaphor, it should then uh, compose with all of the constructions.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor e: And it to the extent that that's true then then it's a big win over anything that exists.\ngrad d: So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm. So that, you know, for example, uh, in the metaphor case, that you have a kind of direct idea of a source, path, and goal and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff  you can do the same grammar.\ngrad d: Mmm.\nprofessor e: And it is the same grammar. But, um, the trick is that the the way the construction's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container. Well, \" trouble \" isn't a container, but it gets constr construed as a c container.\ngrad d: Right.\nprofessor e: Et cetera. So that's that's where this, um,\ngrad d: So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule.\nprofessor e: Right. So's it's it it's a very big deal, i i in this framework, and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't, um, I don't think, say that as clearly as it could.\ngrad c: No, it doesn't say it at all. No. Even though One could argue what if there are basic cases, even. I mean, it seems like nothing is context - free.\nprofessor e: Oh, nothing is context - free, but there are basic cases. That is, um, there are physical containers, there are physical paths, there you know, et cetera.\ngrad c: But \" walked into the cafe and ordered a drink, \" and \" walked into the cafe and broke his nose, \" that's sort of \nprofessor e: Oh, it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous.\ngrad c: Mmm. Yeah.\nprofessor e: I mean, a cafe can be construed as a container, or it can be construed you know as as a obstacle,\ngrad f: Uh - huh.\nprofessor e: or as some physical object. So there are multiple construals. And in fact that's part of what has to be done. This is why there's this interaction between the analysis and the construal.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm. Yep.\nprofessor e: The b the the double arrow.\ngrad c: Yep.\nprofessor e: So, uh, yeah, I mean, it doesn't magically make ambiguity go away.\ngrad c: No.\nprofessor e: But it does say that, uh, if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose, then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: And if that's not consistent with other things, then you 've gotta reject that reading.\ngrad c: Yep.\ngrad d: You con you conditioned me with your first sentence, and so I thought, \" Why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose? \" uh, oh, uh \ngrad f: He slipped on the wet floor.\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad c: You don't find that usage, uh uh, I checked for it in the Brown national corpus.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: The \" walk into it \" never really means, w as in walked smack \nprofessor e: But \" run into \" does.\ngrad c: Yeah, but, y y if you find \" walked smacked into the cafe \" or \" slammed into the wall \" \nprofessor e: Yeah, no, but \" run into \" does.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Because you will find \" run into, \" uh,\ngrad d: Cars run into telephone poles all the time.\nprofessor e: well, or \" into the cafe \" for that m\ngrad c: Right.\nprofessor e: you know \" His car ran into the cafe. \"\ngrad c: Yeah. Or you can run into an old friend, or run.\nprofessor e: Well, you can \" run into \" in that sense too.\ngrad a: Yeah, \" run into \" might even be more impact sense than, you know, container sense.\nprofessor e: But, uh, Right.\ngrad f: Depends.\nprofessor e: But Like, \" run into an old friend \", it probably needs its own construction. I mean, uh, you know, George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: and maybe it is, but, um, there are idioms and my guess is that's one of them, but, um I don't know.\ngrad a: All contact. I mean, there there's contact that doesn't social contact, whatever. I mean.\nprofessor e: Uh.\ngrad f: Sudden surprising contact,\nprofessor e: Yeah, but it's it's it's it's Right. i Yeah, it's more \ngrad f: right?\ngrad a: Forceful.\ngrad f: But of course, no, i i I mean it has a life of its own. It's sort of partially inspired by the spatial \nprofessor e: Well, this is this motivated but yeah \ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: oh yeah, mo for sure, motivated, but then you can't parse on motivated.\ngrad f: Yeah. Yeah. Right.\nprofessor e: Uh,\ngrad a: Too bad.\ngrad d: You should get a T - shirt that says that.\nprofessor e: OK.\ngrad a: There's there's lots of things you could make T - shirts out of, but, uh, this has gotten I mean wh We don't need the words to that.\ngrad c: Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen, today.\ngrad a: What? Oh, no no no no no no no no no, we 're not going there.\ngrad c: Not not your marks.\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor e: OK, so, um,\ngrad f: In other news.\nprofessor e: anything else you want to ask us about the thesis proposal, you got \ngrad c: Well,\nprofessor e: We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it.\ngrad c: Well there actually the i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this, uh, from our domain. So maybe if we w if we can make one up now, that would be c incredibly helpful.\ngrad a: So, w where it should illustrate\nprofessor e: OK.\ngrad a: uh wh when you say all this, do you mean, like, I don't know, the related work stuff,\ngrad c: How \ngrad a: as well as, mappings?\ngrad c: w Well we have, for example, a canonical use of something\nprofessor e: Right right r\ngrad c: and y it's, you know, we have some constructions and then it's construed as something, and then we we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that's also relevant to the to the domain.\nprofessor e: OK, f let's let's suppose you use \" in \" and \" on \". I mean, that's what you started with.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: So \" in the bus \" and \" on the bus, \" um, that's actually a little tricky in English because to some extent they 're synonyms. OK.\ngrad c: I had two hours w with George on this, so it,\nprofessor e: OK, what did he say.\ngrad a: Did you?\ngrad c: um Um.\ngrad a: Join the club.\nprofessor e: Right. Oh, h that's \ngrad c: \" On the bus \" is a m is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on on that path and th w I mean it's he there's a platform notion,\nprofessor e: Yeah, I I believe all that, it's just \ngrad c: right? \" he's on the standing on the bus waving to me. \"\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: But th the regular as we speak \" J Johno was on the bus to New York, \"\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad c: um, uh, he's that's, uh, what did I call it here, the transportation schema, something,\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: where you can be on the first flight, on the second flight,\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: and you can be, you know, on the wagon.\nprofessor e: Right. So so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do. I mean you could do something much simpler\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: like \" under the bus, \" or something, where \ngrad c: But it's it's unfortunately, this is not really something a tourist would ever say. So.\nprofessor e: Well, unless he was repairing it or something,\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: but yeah.\ngrad c: But um.\nprofessor e: Uh, but OK.\ngrad c: So in terms of the this \ngrad a: I see.\ngrad c: We had we had initially we 'd started discussing the \" out of film. \"\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad c: And there's a lot of \" out of \" analysis, so, um,\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad c: could we capture that with a different construal of \ngrad a: Yeah, it's a little it's, uh we 've thought about it before, uh t uh to use the examples in other papers, and it's it's a little complicated. Cuz you 're like, it's a state of there's resource,\ngrad f: Out of out of film, in particular.\ngrad a: right, and like, what is film,\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad a: the state you know. You 're out of the state of having film, right? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource.\ngrad f: It's \ngrad a: I mean.\ngrad f: yeah, I mean,\ngrad a: It's a little bit \ngrad f: but and plus the fact that there's also s I mean, can you say, like, \" The film ran out \" you know, or, maybe you could say something like \" The film is out \"\ngrad a: Yeah, is film the trajector?\ngrad f: so like the the film went away from where it should be, namely with you, or something, right? You know. The the film the film is gone, right? Um, I never really knew what was going on, I mean I I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that that \" I 'm out of film \" means that I have left the state of having film or something like that,\ngrad a: It's weird. That \ngrad f: but.\ngrad a: Or, \" having \" is also, um, associated with location,\nprofessor e: Uh.\ngrad a: right?\ngrad f: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad a: so if the film left, you know state is being near film.\ngrad c: So running running out of something is different from being out of somewhere.\nprofessor e: Or being out of something as, uh as well. So \" running out of it \" definitely has a process aspect to it.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. But that's from run, yeah.\nprofessor e: So,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: b that's OK,\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor e: I mean b but the difference\ngrad c: Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it.\nprofessor e: is \ngrad a: Yeah. So th\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad f: Yeah. You got there.\ngrad a: That part is fine.\ngrad f: You got to out of it.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: But, uh \ngrad f: Hmm!\nprofessor e: Yeah, so so nob so no one has in in of the, uh, professional linguists,\ngrad a: Uh.\nprofessor e: they haven't there was this whole thesis on \" out of \".\ngrad a: There was? Who?\nprofessor e: Well, there I thought or there was a paper on it.\ngrad f: Out.\nprofessor e: Huh?\ngrad f: There was one on on \" out \" or \" out of \"?\nprofessor e: There was a Well, it may be just \" out \". Yeah.\ngrad f: OK.\nprofessor e: I think there was \" over \" but there was also a paper on \" out \".\ngrad f: Yeah, Lind - Susan Lindner,\ngrad a: Oh, yeah, you 're right. Yeah.\nprofessor e: Or something.\ngrad f: right? The the \" the syrup spread out \"?\nprofessor e: Yeah, and all that sort of stuff.\ngrad f: That kind of thing?\ngrad a: Yeah. And undoubtably there's been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics,\nprofessor e: OK. But anyway. We 're not gonna do that between now and next week.\ngrad a: but. Yeah.\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: OK. So, um \ngrad a: It's not one of the y it's more straightforward ones forward ones to defend, so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes \ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad a: th these are you 're addressing like, computational linguists,\nprofessor e: OK.\ngrad a: right. Or are you?\ngrad c: There's gonna be four computational linguists,\ngrad a: OK. But more emphasis on the computational? Or emphasis on the linguist?\ngrad c: computer it's More there's going to be the just four computational linguists, by coincidence, but the rest is, whatever, biocomputing people and physicists.\ngrad a: Oh, OK.\nprofessor e: No no no, but not for your talk. I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes\ngrad c: Oh, the thesis!\ngrad a: Oh, I meant this,\nprofessor e: it's just for one guy.\ngrad c: That's that's computa should be very computational,\ngrad a: you know, like OK. So I would try to I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff.\ngrad c: and, uh, someth\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad a: You know, it's an obvious one \ngrad f: Totally weird stuff.\ngrad c: I mean the the old bakery example might be nice,\ngrad a: but, uh \ngrad c: \" Is there a bakery around here \". So if you c we really just construe it as a \ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad a: Around?\ngrad c: No, it's the bakery itself \ngrad a: Oh.\ngrad c: is it a building? uh, that you want to go to? or is it something to eat that you want to buy?\ngrad a: Oh, oh yeah. Yeah, we 've thought about that. Right. Right.\ngrad c: And then \ngrad a: Nnn. No. What? \" Bakery \" can't be something you 're gonna eat.\nprofessor e: No, no. The question is d do you wanna do you wanna construe do you wanna constr - strue\ngrad f: Sh\ngrad d: It's a speech - act.\nprofessor e: r Exactly. It's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that that i for example, if y\ngrad a: Yeah. Where you can get baked goods.\nprofessor e: Well th well, that's one. You want to buy something. But the other is, uh, yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood, or,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: um, pfff you know, you wonder how people here make their living, and there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: that doesn't mean, \" I want to buy some baked goods. \"\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor e: But um, those are interesting examples but it's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples.\ngrad a: So it's a lot of pragmatics, there, that\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad c: Mmm.\nprofessor e: There's all sorts of stuff going on.\ngrad a: might be beyond what you want to do.\nprofessor e: So let's so let's think about this from the point of view of construal. So let's first do a So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a and actually the Though, the one you have isn't quite \ngrad a: You mean the s You mean \" the steak wants to pay \"?\nprofessor e: N no not that one, that's that's a the sort of background. This is the t uh, page five.\ngrad d: About Plato and the book?\ngrad a: Oh.\nprofessor e: No.\ngrad a: Um.\ngrad c: No.\ngrad a: How much does it cost?\nprofessor e: Just beyond that.\ngrad f: Onward.\ngrad c: Where is the castle?\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad f: A castle.\ngrad c: How old is it? How much does it cost?\ngrad d: Oh.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: To go in, that's like \ngrad f: Two hundred million dollars.\nprofessor e: Right. It's not for sale. Uh. So\ngrad f: Yeah, I think that's a good example, actually.\ngrad c: S\ngrad a: Yeah, that's good. u\ngrad c: But as Nancy just su suggested it's probably ellipticus.\ngrad a: Ellipsis.\ngrad c: Huh.\ngrad a: Like, \" it \" doesn't refer to \" thing, \" it refers to acti you know, j thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist you could think of it that way, but.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Well, shoot, isn't that I mean, that's what \ngrad c: Well, I mean, my argument here is it's it's it's the same thing as \" Plato's on the top shelf, \"\ngrad f: figuring that out is what this is about.\ngrad a: Yeah, yeah, no, I I agree.\ngrad c: I 'm con you know, th that you can refer to a book of Plato by using \" Plato, \"\ngrad a: Yeah. No no, I I 'm agreeing that this is a good, um \ngrad c: and you can refer back to it, and so you can Castles have as tourist sites, have admission fees, so you can say \" Where is the castle, how much does it cost? \" Um. \" How far is it from here? \"\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: So, You 're also not referring to the width of the object, or so,\ngrad a: Hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: www.\ngrad f: Mmm.\nprofessor e: OK. Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of \" where \" in the tourist's domain? Um.\ngrad f: Hmm.\nprofessor e: So you know it's you you can sometimes use \" where \" f for \" when \"\ngrad f: O\nprofessor e: in the sense of, you know, um, where wh where where was, um, \" where was Heidelberg, um, in the Thirty Years ' War? \" Or something.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Uh, yeah.\nprofessor e: You know, or some such thing. Um.\ngrad f: Like what side were they on,\ngrad a: What?\nprofessor e: Yeah. Essentially, yeah.\ngrad f: or?\ngrad a: OK. I was like, \" Huh? It was here. \" Like  Um.\nprofessor e: But anyway th so there are there are cases like that. Um,\ngrad a: Ah! Or like its developmental state or something like that, you could I guess you could get that.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad a: Um.\nprofessor e: Um.\ngrad f: I mean, there's also things like I mean, s um, I guess I could ask something like \" Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah \" in a sort of doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location, just give me a phone number\nprofessor e: Yeah. There certainly is that, yeah.\ngrad f: and I 'll call them or something like that?\nprofessor e: You know, \" Where could I learn its opening hours, \" or something.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: But that's not metaphorical.\ngrad a: Hmm.\nprofessor e: It's another \ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor e: So we 're thinking about, um, or we could also think about, uh \ngrad c: Well, I I I \nprofessor e: How about \" I 'm in a hurry \"?\ngrad a: State.\nprofessor e: It i But it's a state and the the issue is, is that it may be just a usage,\ngrad f: Hmm?\nprofessor e: you know, that it's not particularly metaphorical, I don't know.\ngrad f: Mmm.\ngrad a: Right. So you want a more exotic one version of that.\ngrad f: Oh.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah, right.\ngrad a: I 'm really into \nprofessor e: Ah! How about I I I you know, \" I 'm in I 'm in a state of exhaustion \"?\ngrad a: Do you really say that?\nprofessor e: or something like that, which a tourist w Huh?\ngrad a: Would you really say that?\nprofessor e: A st uh, well, you can certainly say, um, you know, \" I 'm in overload. \" Tu - stur tourists will often say that.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad d: I I 'm really into art.\ngrad a: Yeah, I was gonna say, like \ngrad d: Uh \nprofessor e: Oh, you can do that? Really? Of course that's that that's definitely a, uh \ngrad f: Fixed.\ngrad a: A fixed expression, yeah.\nprofessor e: that's a, uh Right. But. \ngrad a: There 're too there 're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't like uh \" I 'm out of sorts now! \"\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad a: Like \" I 'm in trouble! \"\ngrad c: Well I when, uh just f u the data that I 've looked at so far that rec\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: I mean, there's tons of cases for polysemy.\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad a: Uh - huh.\ngrad c: So, you know, mak re making reference to buildings as institutions, as containers, as build\nprofessor e: Right.\ngrad c: you know, whatever. Um, so ib in mus for example, in museums, you know, as a building or as something where pictures hang versus, you know, ev something that puts on exhibits, so forth.\nprofessor e: Right. As an institution,\ngrad c: But \nprofessor e: yeah.\ngrad c: Um.\ngrad a: Why don't you want to use any of those?\ngrad c: Hmm?\ngrad a: So y you don't wanna use one that's \ngrad c: Yeah, well No, but this that's what I have, you know, started doing.\nprofessor e: The castle the that old castle one is sort of \ngrad c: Metonymy, polysemy.\ngrad d: I love Van Gogh.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad a: \" I wanna go see the Van Gogh. \"\nprofessor e: Ah!\ngrad f: Oh geez.\ngrad a: Anyway, I 'm sorry.\ngrad c: But I think the argument should be uh, can be made that, you know, despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain, because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical,\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad c: construal still is, uh, you know, completely, um, key in terms of finding out any of these things, so, um.\nprofessor e: Right. So that's that's that's a that's a reasonable point, that it in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy.\ngrad c: We, uh I with a I looked with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy.\nprofessor e: And polysemy, and stuff like that. Yeah.\ngrad c: Hardly anything. So not even in descriptions w did we find anything, um, relevant.\ngrad f: I have to go.\nprofessor e: Alright. Yeah.\ngrad c: But OK this is just something we 'll we 'll see, um,\nprofessor e: Right. s See you.\ngrad c: and deal with.\nprofessor e: OK, well. I guess if anybody has additional suggestions,\ngrad c: I mean maybe the \" where is something \" question as a whole, you know, can be construed as, u i locational versus instructional request.\nprofessor e: w Yeah.\ngrad c: So, if we 're not talk about the lexic\ngrad a: Location versus what?\ngrad c: instruction.\ngrad a: Instruction. Oh, directions? Yeah.\nprofessor e: Sure.\ngrad a: Oh, I thought that was definitely treated as an example of construal.\ngrad c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Right?\ngrad c: Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level, that's sort of one level higher.\ngrad a: Oh, you want a lexical example.\ngrad c: But I don't need it.\nprofessor e: Well, you might want both.\ngrad c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad c: Also it would be nice to get ultimately to get a nice mental space example,\nprofessor e: We \ngrad c: so, even temporal references are just in the spatial domain are rare.\nprofessor e: But it's it's easy to make up plausible ones.\ngrad c: When when you 're getting information on objects.\nprofessor e: You know.\ngrad c: So, I mean \nprofessor e: Right, you know you know, where r Yeah. What color was this in in in the nain nineteenth century.\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: What was this p instead of wh what you know how was this painted, what color was this painted, um, was this alleyway open.\ngrad c: Yeah, maybe we can include that also in our second, uh, data run.\nprofessor e: Uh.\ngrad c: We c we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm. OK. So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically. Wish you a good trip. All success.\ngrad d: For some reason when you said \" feedback electronically \" I thought of that you ever see the Simpsons where they 're like the family's got the buzzers and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying?\ngrad a: Yeah.

Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: \"walk/run into\", \"on the bus\", \"out of film\", \"where is X?\".

Plusieurs exemples potentiels de polysémie ont été discutés en détail : « marcher/courir dans », « dans le bus », « hors du film », « où est X ? ».

Базові конструкції стосуються норми, тоді як подальші загальні доменні механізми визначають, як залучаються конструкції в залежності від контексту.

Is Jane around or?\nphd d: I saw her earlier.\nprofessor f: Uh.\nphd d: I think \nphd g: She can just walk in, I guess, or \nphd d: Yeah. She 'll probably come up.\nprofessor f: Right.\nphd g: Since we 're starting late I figured we 'd better just start.\nprofessor f: Yeah. Great idea. I was gonna ask Adam to, uh, say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff because it occurred to me that this is late May and the DARPA meeting is in mid July. Uh, but I don't remember w what we I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing, but I thought there was a second thing. Anybody remember?\nphd g: Well, we were gonna do a mock - up, like, question answering or something, I thought, that was totally separate from the interface. Do you remember? Remember, like, asking questions and retrieving, but in a pre - stored fashion.\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm. Right.\nphd g: That was the thing we talked about, I think, before the transcriber \nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd g: Come on in.\nprofessor f: Alright. So anyway, you have to sort out that out and get somebody going on it cuz we 're got a got a month left basically. So.\nphd g: You like these. Right? OK, good.\nprofessor f: OK. Um OK. So, what are we g else we got? You got you just wrote a bunch of stuff.\nphd g: No. That was all, um, previously here.\nprofessor f: Oh.\nphd g: I was writing the digits and then I realized I could xerox them,\nprofessor f: Oh, oh.\nphd g: because I didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones. So. We all, by the way, have the same digit form, for the record. So.\nprofessor f: That's cool.\nphd g: Yeah.\nprofessor f: So, the choice is, uh, which which do we want more, the the the comparison, uh, of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that?\nphd g: It's just cuz I didn't have any more digit sheets.\nprofessor f: I know that. But, you know, which opportunity should we\nphd g: So. Yeah.\nphd c: Unison.\nprofessor f: exploit? Unison.\nphd g: I mean, it Actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings. I mean, we could use them for normalizing or something, but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison.\nprofessor f: I guess we 'll see\nphd g: I don't know.\nprofessor f: i I guess it's dependent on\nphd g: See how long we go.\nprofessor f: how long we go and how good the snack is out there.\nphd e: But anyway, they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some sometimes, you know, saying O, and so, it's not i not identical.\nprofessor f: Yeah. Hmm. Get some advance intelligence.\nphd g: Right. Right.\nprofessor f: Yeah. We 'd have to train.\nphd g: We 'd be like a chorus.\nphd e: OK.\nprofessor f: Yeah.

Uh ju what what might those be?\nphd d: Uh, IBM stuff and, um, just getting uh, meeting information organized.\nprofessor f: Meeting info organized. OK. Um.\nphd c: Are you implying that it's currently disorganized?\nphd d: In my mind.\nprofessor f: Is there stuff that's happened about, um, uh, the SRI recognizer et cetera, tho those things that were happening before with?\nphd c: Well.\nprofessor f: Y y you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front - ends and then with Is is that still sort of where it was, uh, the other day?\nphd c: We 're improving.\nprofessor f: We 're improving.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: Now the the You saw the note that the PLP now is getting basically the same as the MFCC.\nprofessor f: Right.\nphd d: Right?\nphd c: Yeah. Actually it looks like it's getting better.\nprofessor f: Right. Oh.\nphd c: So. But but it's not \nprofessor f: Just with with age, kind of.\nphd c: With age. Yeah.\nprofessor f: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd c: But, uh, that's not d directly related to me. Doesn't mean we can't talk about it. Um, it seems It looks l I haven't The It's The experiment is still not complete, but, um, it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully, actually, w using the warp factors that we computed for the SRI system and just applying them to the ICSI front - end.\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm. That's pretty funny.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor f: OK.\nphd g: So you just need to copy over to this one.\nphd c: Just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems.\npostdoc a: OK.\nprofessor f: Ah! Yeah. Well, that's always good to do.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor f: OK. OK. Uh \nphd c: But one issue actually that just came up in discussion with Liz and and Don was, um, as far as meeting recognition is concerned, um, we would really like to, uh, move, uh, to, uh, doing the recognition on automatic segmentations.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd c: Because in all our previous experiments, we had the uh, you know, we were essentially cheating by having the, um, you know, the h the hand - segmentations as the basis of the recognition.\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: And so now with Thilo's segmenter working so well, I think we should consider doing a \nphd e: Mmm. So.\ngrad b: Come on.\nphd c: uh, doing \nphd e: Yeah. We But \nprofessor f: Y think you think we should increase the error rate.\nphd e: Anyway. Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd e: Yeah.\nprofessor f: Good.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd e: That - that's what I wanted to do anyway,\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd e: so we should just get together and \nphd g: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd g: And even The good thing is that since you, um, have high recall, even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating, that's good because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of, uh, transients and things that come from the microphones,\nphd c: Right.\nphd e: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd g: but I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform, we do very poorly because we 're we 're getting insertions in places what that you may well be cutting out.\nphd c: Well \nphd e: Yeah.\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: So we do need some kind of pre - segmentation.\nphd c: We should we should consider doing some extra things, like, um, you know, retraining or adapting the the models for background noise to the to this environment, for instance.\nphd g: Mmm. Yeah.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: And, yeah, using Thilo's, you know, posteriors or some kind of or \nphd c: So.\nphd g: right now they 're they 're discrete,\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: yes or no for a speaker, to consider those particular speaker background models.\nphd c: Right.\nphd g: So. There's lots of ins interesting things that could be done.\nphd e: Yeah. Yeah. We should do that.\nphd g: So.\nprofessor f: Good. So, uh, why don't we, uh, do the IBM stuff?\nphd d: Yeah. So, um, talked with Brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before.\nprofessor f: You had some thing about that? Right.\nphd d: And so \nprofessor f: The, uh, Chuck chunks.\nphd d: Yeah. The Chuck chunks.\nphd e: Hmm.\nphd d: Right. And so he talked it over with the transcriber and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number, a digit, and then a beep, uh, at the beginning of each one\nprofessor f: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd d: and that would help keep them from getting lost. And, um, so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style, uh, beeps\nphd c: Where 'd you get the digits from?\nphd d: and so we 're I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten.\npostdoc a: They sound really good.\nphd d: So. Does it sound OK?\nphd g: That's a great idea.\npostdoc a: Yeah.\nphd d: So, um Yeah. We just used those.\nphd c: And do you splice them into the waveform? Or?\nphd d: Yeah. He then he d I recorded Actually, I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked.\nphd c: Right. Mm - hmm.\nphd d: He liked the fastest one, so he just cut those out and spliced them in between, uh, two beeps.\npostdoc a: It sounds like a radio announcer's voice. Really.\nphd e: It will be funny uh \npostdoc a: Yeah, yeah.\nphd d: Does it?\nphd e: It will be funny when you 're really reading digits, and then there are the chunks with with your digits in?\nphd d: Yeah. With my \npostdoc a: Oh that's right.\nphd g: Oh, right.\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: Now actually,\nphd d: That 'll throw them,\npostdoc a: we 're Are we handling?\nphd d: huh?\nprofessor f: Uh, maybe we should have you record A, B, C for those or something.\nphd d: Yeah. Huh! Maybe. And she said it wasn't gonna the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template, uh, that has beep, number, beep. So for them it 'll be very quick\nphd e: OK.\nphd d: to to put those in there when they 're transcribing.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd d: So, um, we We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting, uh, and Thilo has run his segmentation. Adam's gonna generate the chunked file. And then, um, I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out. And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with, uh, too many beeps in the last transcription.\nprofessor f: OK. Do w do what Do you have any idea of the turn - around on on those steps you just said?\nphd g: Great.\nphd d: Uh. Our s our On our side?\nprofessor f: Uh.\nphd d: or including IBM's?\nprofessor f: Including IBM's.\nphd d: Well, I don't know. The last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks. Um, maybe even three.\nprofessor f: OK.\nphd d: Uh, that's just the I B M side. Our side is quick. I mean, I I don't know. How long does your?\nphd e: It should @ @ be finished today or something. Yeah.\nprofessor f: Well, I meant the overall thing.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor f: e e u u The reason I 'm asking is because, uh, Jane and I have just been talking, and she's just been doing. Uh, e a, you know, further hiring of transcribers.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing, how long they 'll be doing it, and so forth, because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working.\nphd d: Right.\nprofessor f: And, uh, so it 'd be It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved, uh, soon as we could,\nphd d: Yeah. I Yeah, I I hope @ @ we can get a better estimate from this one that we send them.\nprofessor f: and then \nphd d: So. Um.\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: I I don't know yet how long that 'll take.\nprofessor f: Yeah. Um I mean in particular I would I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have we 're we 're into production mode, somehow \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: You know, that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor f: I think that would that would certainly be a a very good thing to know.\nphd d: Right. Right.\nprofessor f: OK. Uh. Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing, maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions.\npostdoc a: OK. So, um, we Uh, the transcribers have continued to work past what I 'm calling \" set one \", which was the s the set that I 've been, uh OK, talking about up to this point, but, uh, they 've gotten five meetings done in that set. Right now they 're in the process of being edited. Um, the, um Let's see, I hired two transcribers today. I 'm thinking of hiring another one, which will because we 've had a lot of attrition. And that will bring our total to \nprofessor f: They die off after they do this for a while.\npostdoc a: Yeah. Well, you know, it's it's various things.\nphd d: Burn - out.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\npostdoc a: So, one of them had a baby. Um, you know, one of them really w wasn't planning \nphd c: Oh, that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of \npostdoc a: Eh, one of them, um, had never planned to work past January. I mean, it's th all these various things, cuz we, you know, we presented it as possibly a month project back in January and and and and Um, so it makes sense. Uh, through attrition we we 've we 're down to to two, but they 're really solid. We 're really lucky the two that we kept. And, um Well, I don't mean I don't mean anything against the others. What I mean is we 've got a good cause a good core. No. We had a good core \nphd g: Well, they won't hear this since they 're going. They won't be transcribing this meeting.\npostdoc a: Yeah, but still. I mean, I d it's just a matter of we w we 're we 've got, uh,\nprofessor f: No backs.\npostdoc a: two of the ones who who, um, ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a a lot of hours, which is wonderful, and excellent work. And so, then, in addition, um, I hired two more today and I 'm planning to h hire a third one with this within this coming week, but but the plan is just as, uh, Morgan was saying we discussed this, and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side, you know, rather than hiring, like, eight to ten right now,\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc a: because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly, then, um, we wouldn't wanna have to, uh, you know, lay people off and stuff. So. And this way it 'll I mean, I got really a lot of response for for my notice and I think I could hire additional people if I wish to.\nprofessor f: Yeah. An - and the other thing is, I mean, in the unlikely event and since we 're so far from this, it's a little hard to plan this way in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have, uh, transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because, you know, there's, you know, all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're and they 're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh, than the generation, um, eh, i in in the day e event that that day actually dawns, uh, I I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do.\npostdoc a: Oh, yes.\nprofessor f: So I I think that, eh, eh, a as we were talking, if we if we hire twelve, then we could, you know, run into a problem later. I mean, we also just couldn't sustain that forever. But but, um for all sorts of reasons but if we hire f you know, f we have five on staff five or six on staff at any given time, then it's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way.\npostdoc a: Good. OK.\nprofessor f: Good.\nphd g: It 'd be great, too, if, um, we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand to experiment with, um you know, to have a ground truth for this segmentation work, which I guess you have some already that was really helpful, and we could probably use more.\nphd e: Mmm, yeah. That was a thing I I planned working on, is, uh, to use the the transcriptions which are done by now, and to to use them as, uh \nphd g: Oh. Oh, the new ones\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: with the tighter boundaries. Yeah.\nphd e: Yeah. And to use them for for training a or for fo whatever. Yeah. To to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them, and Yeah, but that that's a thing w was w what I 'm just looking into.\nphd g: OK.\npostdoc a: The the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful. Now there was, uh, I g guess So, a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation f for just very few days you were away. But it happened to be during that time I needed one,\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: so I so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and, um, they, um you know, they always appreciate that when they have that available. And he's, uh, usually, eh, uh, um Um. So they really appreciate it. But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while. You know, once in a while there's something like,\nphd e: Yeah, sure.\npostdoc a: um, and e Actually you talked to them. Didn't you? Did you? Have you?\nphd e: Yeah. I talked to Helen.\npostdoc a: And and and she was And so, I asked her I mean, They 're very perceptive. I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers. I haven't done it yet, but I wanna do that and she's out of town, um, for a couple of weeks, but I wanna do that when she returns. Um, cuz she was saying, you know, in a in a span of very short period we asked It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these these these things, and she was saying the short utterances, uh, the, um \nphd g: Hmm.\nphd e: Mmm. Yeah.\npostdoc a: you know, I mean, you 're You 're aware of this. But but actually i it's so correct for so much of the time, that it's an enormous time saver\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries. So.\nphd g: That's great.\npostdoc a: Um. Yeah. I think it 'd be interesting to combine these.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: Is there actually a record of where they change? I mean, you can compare, do a diff on the just so that we knew \npostdoc a: You could do it. It's it's complicated in that um, hhh, i hhh, i\nphd e: Yeah. Actually, when when they create new yeah, new segments or something, it will be, uh, not that easy but hmm. I think one could do that.\nphd g: I mean, if we keep a old copy of the old time marks\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: just so that if we run it we know whether we 're which ones were cheating\nphd e: Yeah. Yeah. That would be great, yeah, to know that.\nphd g: and\npostdoc a: There is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version.\nphd g: which one would be good.\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: So it's not a pure it's not a pure condition. Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through.\nphd g: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc a: And, um @ @  I, uh the it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones. But, it will be possible in the future\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: because we we 're, um.\nphd e: It would.\nphd g: Mmm, that's great.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: Yeah. As long as we have a record, I guess, of the original automatic one, we can always find out how well we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries.\nphd e: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd g: Um.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: You know, a completely non - cheating version.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: Also if you need someone to record this meeting, I mean, I 'm happy to for the transcribers I could do it, or Chuck or Adam.\npostdoc a: Thank you.\nprofessor f: OK. So, uh, u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info?\nphd d: Yeah. So, um, uh, Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting \nprofessor f: Did you record it?\nphd d: No. For all the Meeting Recorder data. We should have. Um. And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there. And then, Jane also s prepared a um, started getting all of the the meetings organized, so she prepared a a spreadsheet, which I spent the last couple of days adding to. So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far, and have been putting it into, uh, a spreadsheet with start time, the date, the old meeting name, the new meeting name, the number of speakers, the duration of the meeting, comments, you know, what its transcription status is, all that kind of stuff. And so, the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what's going on.\nphd g: Oh, great.\nphd d: Um, I 've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in, but so far, um, as of Monday, the fourteenth, um, we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected. And, um Uh, some other interesting things, average number of speakers per meeting is six. Um, and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that's been transcribed so far, but I 've got a bunch of uh, that's what I have to talk to Jane about, figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth. But, um, this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones. And it 'll also list, uh, like under the status, if it's at IBM or if it's at ICSI, uh, or if it's completed or which ones we 're excluding and and there's a place for comments, so we can, um, say why we 're excluding things and so forth. So.\nprofessor f: Now would the ones that, um, are already transcribed we h we have enough there that c you know, we 've already done some studies and so forth and um, shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of of having the, um, uh, participants approve it, uh, for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth?\npostdoc a: Um, interesting idea. In principle, I I would say yes, although I still am doing some the final - pass editing, trying to convert it over to the master file as the being the channelized version and it's Yeah, it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes and I have to stop. Cleaning up the things like the, uh, uh, places where the transcriber was uncertain, and and doing spot - checking here and there. So, um, uh, I guess it would make sense to wait until th that's done, um, but but \nprofessor f: Well, le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as I did with the, uh, uh the the pipeline.\npostdoc a: Yeah.\nprofessor f: Um, we are gonna have this DARPA meeting in the middle of July,\npostdoc a: Yes.\nprofessor f: and I think it w it 'd be given that we 've been we 've given a couple public talks about it already, spaced by months and months, I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available. Um.\npostdoc a: It 'll certainly be done by then. Yeah.\nprofessor f: Right. So we can s we we wanna be able to say \" here is a subset that is available right now \"\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm. That's right.\nprofessor f: and that's has been through the legal issues and so forth.\npostdoc a: That's right.\nprofessor f: So.\npostdoc a: Yeah. That's right. So that \nprofessor f: OK?\npostdoc a: OK.\nprofessor f: So, by before July.\nphd c: And they don't have to approve, you know, th an edited version, they can just give their approval to whatever version\npostdoc a: Well, maybe \nprofessor f: Well, in principle, yes. But, I mean, i if if if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we\nphd c: Bu Yeah. But th I mean, the editing will continue. Presumably if if s errors are found, they will be fixed, but they won't change the the content of the meetings.\nphd d: Content, really.\npostdoc a: Well, see, this is the this is the issue. Subtleties.\nphd c: So.\nphd g: Well, i if Jane is clarifying question question, then, you know, how can they agree to it before they know her final version?\npostdoc a: The other thing, too, is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word, which @ @ could 've been transcribed in the other way.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd g: Thing \npostdoc a: And no and they wouldn't have been slanderous if it had been this other word. You know?\nprofessor f: I it you know, there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because, you know, you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say, you know, that should be a period and not a question mark. Right? And you don't you there's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody \" do you approve this, uh, you know this document now? \" So So I think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign I I haven't looked at it in a while, but it has to be open enough that it sort of says \" OK, from now on you know, now that I 've read this, you can use do anything you want with these data. \"\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: And, uh But, i I think we wanna So, assuming that it's in that kind of wording, which I don't remember, um, I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it's so close to the final form it's gonna be in, a year from now that they 're \npostdoc a: Mm - hmm. I agree. Mmm. I totally agree. It's just, uh, a question of, uh, if if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous, then it seems like it's it's i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting.\nprofessor f: Uh.\npostdoc a: Because it becomes, eh, in a way a a f uh, a legal document i if they 've agreed to that.\nprofessor f: Well, I forget how we end Right. I forget how we ended up on this, but I remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything and Adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio. And I don't remember who won, Adam or me, but \npostdoc a: Well, if it's only the transcript, though I mean, th this this is my point, that that\nprofessor f: uh, the Uh, that that's why I 'm bringing this up again, because I can't remember how we ended up.\npostdoc a: then it becomes \nprofessor f: That it was the transcrip He wanted to do a web interface that would make it \npostdoc a: Well, if it's just the audio Well.\nprofessor f: that would give you access to the transcript and the audio. That's what Adam wanted.\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: And I don't remember how we ended up.\nphd g: I mean, with the web interface it's interesting, because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes, or something like that. And, I mean, I would say \" no \". Like, I don't wanna know, but some people might be really interested and then y In other words, they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that.\nprofessor f: You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were \nphd g: Well, I don't know what happened to the small heads thing, but I j Um, I 'm just saying that, like, you know, you can sort of say that any things that are deemed \nprofessor f: They disappeared from view.\nphd g: Anyway. I mean, I agree that at some point people probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes and then they could be asked for their consent, I guess, if if those change. Cuz assumi assuming we we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway.\nphd c: Tha That's How about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts?\nphd g: Oh, my God.\npostdoc a: That would be simpler,\nprofessor f: Uh.\npostdoc a: if we could count on them listening.\nphd g: But no one will listen to the hours and hours of \nphd d: Talk.\nphd c: Well, that's O K.\ngrad b: That's \nphd c: We just have to give them a chance to listen to it, and if they don't, that's their problem.\ngrad b: hmm, hmm.\nphd g: You you d That's like \npostdoc a: Unfortunately, uh, in in the sign thing that they signed, it says \" transcripts \".\nphd c: No, I 'm serious.\npostdoc a: \" You 'll be you 'll be provided the transcripts when they 're available. \"\nphd c: Really?\ngrad b: Mmm.\nphd c: Mmm.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: I I I think\npostdoc a: Yeah.\nphd g: that's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings.\npostdoc a: Yeah.\nprofessor f: W anyway, haven't we we 've gone down this path a number of times. I know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere, so let let me just suggest that uh, off - line that, uh, the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it's July.\npostdoc a: Yes.\nprofessor f: OK. So so that in July we can tell people \" yes, we have this and you can use it \".\npostdoc a: Yes. It's done, ready, available. Good.\nprofessor f: Uh. So, let's see. What else we got? Uh. Don did did a report about his project in class and, uh an oral and written written version.\nphd g: Well.\nprofessor f: So that was stuff he was doing with you. Yeah.\nphd g: I mean, it's I guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount We have eight meetings there because we couldn't use the non - native all non - native meetings and it's, well, probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them. Um, so we 're starting to see some patterns and we 're hoping that maybe with, I don't know, double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so, that we would start to get better results. But we did find that some of the features that, I gue Jane would know about, that are expressing sort of the distance of, um, boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local, um, range pitch range effects, like how close people are to their floor, are showing up in these classifiers, which are also being given some word features that are cheating, cuz they 're true words. Um, so these are based on forced alignment. Word features like, um, word frequency and whether or not something's a backchannel and so forth. So, we 're starting to see, I think, some interesting patterns.\nprofessor f: So the dominant features, including everything, were those those quasi - cheating things. Right? Where these are \ngrad b: Sometimes not.\nphd g: I think it depends what you 're looking at, a actually.\ngrad b: Yeah. Sometimes positions in sentences obviously, or in spurts, was helpful. I don't know if that's cheating, too.\nphd g: Right. Um,\nphd c: Spurts wouldn't be. Right?\nphd g: spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words,\ngrad b: Right.\nphd g: but roughly speaking, the recognized words are gonna give you a similar type of position.\ngrad b: Right. Would they give you the same number of words, though?\nprofessor f: Right.\nphd g: It's either early or late.\nphd c: No\nphd g: Not exactly, but i\ngrad b: But ra somewhat?\nprofessor f: On the average.\nphd g: Y yeah it should be. Well, we don't know and actually that's one of the things we 're interested in doing, is a sort of \nprofessor f: Uh - huh.\nphd c: Have you tried using just time, as opposed to number of words?\nphd g: So.\ngrad b: I think ti uh Just p time position, like when the word starts?\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad b: I don't know if that was in the \nphd c: Well, no, I mean t time time position relative to the beginning of the spurt.\nphd g: Eh You know, uh\ngrad b: Start.\nphd g: Yeah,\ngrad b: Yeah. There's all these things to do.\nphd g: uh, we didn't try it, but it's s\ngrad b: Like, there's a lot of different features you could just pull out.\nphd c: Yeah. I mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause pretty well within the time.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd g: Right.\nprofessor f: How about time position normalized by speak\nphd g: And it depends on speaking rate \nprofessor f: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd g: speaking rate. Yeah.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nphd g: Yeah. That's actually why I didn't use it at first.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: But we one of the interesting things was I guess you reported on some te punctuation type \ngrad b: Yeah.\nphd g: finding sentence boundaries, finding disfluency boundaries, and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt, so where you know, if I 'm talking now and someone and and Andreas is about to interrupt me, is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech, either prosodically or word - based. And there the prosodic features actually showed up and a neat thing even though the word features were available. And a neat thing there too is I tried some putting the speaker So, I gave everybody a short version of their name. So the real names are in there, which we couldn't use. Uh, we should use I Ds or something. And those don't show up. So that means that overall, um, it wasn't just modeling Morgan, or it wasn't just modeling a single person,\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: um, but was sort of trying to, uh, get a general idea the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers, even though there are huge speaker effects. So. The but the main limitation now is I because we 're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words, we need more more data and more data per speaker. So. It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings because we did include meeting type as a feature, so whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter to interrupts because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person,\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: which is not bad. It 'd probably do better than Um, but it wasn't generalizing.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd g: So it's And I think Don, um Well, we have a long list of things he's starting to look at now over the summer, where we can And he 'll be able to report on more things in the future. But it was great that we could at least go from the you know, Jane's transcripts and the, uh, recognizer output and get it to this point. And I think it's something Mari can probably use in her preliminary report like, \" yeah, we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features, both word and pro prosodic, work. \" The other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in Switchboard. And I think that really is from the close - talking mikes, cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the Switchboard telephone bandwidth.\nphd c: W wh wh wh Better in what sense?\nphd g: Um. Well, first of all, the pitch tracks are m have less, um, halvings and doublings than than Switchboard and there's a lot less dropout, so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information,\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm. \nphd g: in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words for for, you know, five word\nprofessor f: Hmm.\nphd g: there are much fewer than in Switchboard. So the missing We had a big missing data problem in Switchboard and, so the features weren't as reliable cuz they were often just not available.\nphd d: Could it have to do with the the lower frequency cut - off on the Switchboard?\nphd g: So that's actually good. Ma - maybe. I mean, the tele we had telephone bandwidth for Switchboard and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that I think may also affect it.\nphd d: Hmm.\nphd g: So we 're just getting better signals in in this data. Which is nice. So.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd g: Anyway, Don's been doing a great job and we hope to continue with, um, Andreas's help and also some of Thilo's help on this,\nprofessor f: Great.\nphd e: Y\nphd g: to to try to get a non - cheating version of how all this would work.\nphd e: Yeah. Sure. Yeah.\nprofessor f: Has has, uh? We just I think, just talked about this the other day, but h has has anybody had a chance to try changing, uh, insertion penalty sort of things with the with the, uh uh, using the tandem system input for the?\nphd c: Oh, yeah. I tried that. It didn't, um, help dramatically. The \nphd d: Were they out of balance? I didn't I didn't notice.\nphd c: There were a little the relative number of I think there were a higher number of deletions, actually.\nprofessor f: Oh.\nphd c: So, you, uh So, actually it it preferred to have a positive er, negative insertion penalty,\nphd g: Deletions?\nphd c: which means that, um \nprofessor f: Uh - huh.\nphd c: But, you know, it didn't change th the by adjusting that the, um \nprofessor f: OK.\nphd c: Yeah. The error changed by probably one percent or so. But, you know, given that that word error rate is so high, that's not a \nprofessor f: OK. So that So that's So that's not the problem.\nphd c: That's not the problem. No.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd c: But, uh, we s just, um, uh you know, Chuck and I talked and the @ @ next thing to do is probably to tune the um, the size of the Gaussian system, um, @ @ to to this to this feature vector, which we haven't done at all. We just used the same configuration as we used for the for the standard system.\nprofessor f: Hmm.\nphd c: And, for instance, uh, Dan @ @ Dan just sent me a message saying that CMU used, um, something like ten Gaussians per cluster You know, each each mixture has ten Gaussians\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Hmm. We 're using sixty - four,\nphd c: and and we 're using sixty - four,\nphd d: right?\nphd c: so that's obviously a big difference\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: and it might be way off and give very poorly trained, uh, you know, Gaussians that way,\nprofessor f: Hmm.\nphd c: uh, an and poorly trained mixture weights. So so, we have The turn - around time on the training when we train only the a male system with, uh, you know, our small training set, is less than twenty - four hours, so we can run lots of uh, basically just brute force, try a whole bunch of different um, settings.\nprofessor f: OK.\nphd c: And, uh, with the new machines it 'll be even better. So.\nprofessor f: Yeah. We get twelve of those,\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor f: huh?\nphd c: But the PLP features work um, uh, you know, continue to improve the,\nprofessor f: OK.\nphd c: um As I said before, the uh using Dan's, uh, uh, vocal tract normalization option works very well. So, um, @ @ I ran one experiment where we 're just did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data,\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: so I didn't bother to retrain the models at all, and it improved by one percent, which is about what we get with uh, with, you know, just @ @ actually doing both training and test normalization, um, with, um, the, uh uh, with the standard system. So, in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization and So, that might even improve it further.\nprofessor f: Great.\nphd c: So, it looks like the P L - fea P features do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd c: So.\nprofessor f: Good.\nphd g: Wait. So you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any V T L in it already?\nphd c: Exactly. Yeah.\nphd g: OK.\nprofessor f: Yeah. OK. So then then we 'll have our baseline to to compare the currently hideous, uh, uh, new thing with.\nphd c: Right. a Right. And and what that suggests also is of course that the current Switchboard MLP isn't trained on very good features.\nprofessor f: But Yeah.\nphd c: Uh, because it was trained on whatever, you know, was used, uh, last time you did Hub - five stuff, which didn't have any of the \nprofessor f: Right. But all of these effects were j like a couple percent.\nphd c: Uh.\nprofessor f: Right? I mean, y the \nphd c: Well, but if you add them all up you have, uh, almost five percent difference now.\nprofessor f: Add all of them. I thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight.\nphd c: Yeah. And now we have another percent with the V T\nprofessor f: That's three point three.\nphd c: Um, actually, and it's, um, What's actually qu interesting is that with um, well, you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the VTL in training, and then interestingly, if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the, um, uh, the N best lists, uh, and optimizing the weights, um, uh than \nphd d: Than you do with the standard?\nphd c: Yeah. So \nprofessor f: Yeah. But the part that's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting VTLN in or something is it was a couple percent.\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor f: Right? It was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight. So and and let me see if I remember what they were. One of them was, uh, the change to, uh because it did it all at once, to uh, from bark scale to mel scale,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: which I really feel like saying in quotes, because @ @ they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place.\nphd g: Yeah. Why did that cha?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: So that's why I wanted to look I still haven't looked at it yet. I I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: and it it's probably something like there's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other.\nphd g: Hmm.\nprofessor f: Um, it could be there's something more fundamental but it you know, I I don't know it yet. And the other and the other that was like one and a half or something, and then there was point eight percent, which was what was the other thing?\nphd d: Well, that was combined with the triangular. Right?\nprofessor f: Yeah. Those those two were together.\nphd d: Yeah. Right.\nprofessor f: We d weren't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing. But then there was a point eight percent which was something else.\nphd d: The low - frequency cut - off.\nprofessor f: Do you remember the? Oh, yeah. So that was that was, uh that one I can claim credit for, uh, i in terms of screwing it up in the first place. So that someone e until someone else fixed it, which is that, um, I never put when I u We had some problems before with offsets. This inf this went back to, uh, I think Wall Street Journal.\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor f: So we we had, uh ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data in those data and and and nobody happened to mention it to us,\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor f: and we were getting these, like, really terrible results, like two, three times the error everybody else was getting. And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned \" uh, well, I guess, you know, of course you 're taking care of the offsets. \" I said \" what offsets? \"\ngrad b: \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: And at that point, you know, we were pretty new to the data and we 'd never really, like, looked at it on a screen and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop!\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: there's this big DC offset. So, um, in PLP\nphd g: There was a like a hum or some or when they recorded it?\nprofessor f: No. It's just, it it's it's not at all uncommon for for recorded electronics to have different, um, DC offsets.\nphd g: Or just? Huh.\nprofessor f: It's it's, you know, no big deal. It's you know, you could have ten, twenty, maybe thirty millivolts, whatever, and it's consistently in there. The thing is, most people's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it, with zero at zero frequency, so that it's irrelevant. Uh, but with P L P, we didn't actually have that. We had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a, uh, Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency,\nphd g: Hmm.\nprofessor f: like, eh, uh, typical simple fr pre - emphasis does. We had something more fancy. It was later on it didn't have that. So at that point I reali \" oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter \" just, you know just take care of the problem. So I put in a high - pass filter at, uh, I think ninety ninety hertz or so uh, for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate. And I never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates. And so well, so, you know, the code doesn't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety.\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor f: So, um, I don't know if Dan fixed it or or, uh, what he \nphd c: Well, he made it a parameter.\nprofessor f: He made it a parameter. So. Yeah, I guess if he did it right, he did fix it and then and then it's taking care of sampling rate, which is great.\nphd d: What what is the parameter?\nprofessor f: He had a \nphd d: Is it, uh, just the f lower cut - off that you want?\nphd c: It's called, uh, H - HPF.\nprofessor f: H Yeah. Does HPF on on his feat feature.\nphd c: u And but HPF, you know, when you put a number after it, uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Oh, OK.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd c: So.\nprofessor f: I mean, frankly, we never did that with the RASTA filter either,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing, which is another old old bug of mine.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: But, um Um. So that that was the problem there was th we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: and it just wasn't doing it, so now it is. So, that hep that helped us by, like, eight tenths of a percent. It still wasn't a big deal.\nphd c: OK. Well, but, um Well, uh, again, after completing the current experiments, we 'll we can add up all the uh differences\nprofessor f: Oh, yeah.\nphd c: and and an\nprofessor f: But but, I guess my my point was that that, um, the hybrid system thing that we did was, uh, primitive in many ways.\nphd c: Y Right.\nprofessor f: And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up, we would probably have a a a competitive system. But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se. I think maybe a couple percent of it is, as far as I can see from this.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: Uh, unless you call well, if you call VTL the front - en front - end, that's, uh, a little more. But that's sort of more both, kind of.\nphd d: One experiment we should we 'll probably need to do though when um, at some point, is, since we 're using that same the net that was trained on PLP without all these things in it, for the tandem system, we may wanna go back and retrain,\nprofessor f: Right? But.\nphd c: Well, that's what I meant, in fact. Yeah.\nphd d: yeah, yeah, for the tandem. You know, so we can see if it what effect it has on the tandem processing.\nphd c: So so, the thing is is do we expect?\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: eh At this point I 'm as I mean, you know e I 'm wondering is it Can we expect, uh, a tandem system to do better than a properly trained you know, a Gaussian system trained directly on the features with, you know, the right ch choice of parameters?\nprofessor f: Well, that's what we 're seeing in other areas. Yes. Right? So, it's so, um, um \nphd d: So, we But but we may not. I mean, if it doesn't perform as well, we may not know why. Right? Cuz we need to do the exact experiment.\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor f: I mean, the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative. So. Um. Now the thing is, in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much and and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do, not just th the standard front - end, but other things, like with multiple streams and so forth,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel. Um, so I think I think that's the real power of it. I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements. Um, but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: If it's, you know, like way way worse then, you know \nphd c: Right.\nphd d: So, Morgan, an another thing that Andreas and I were talking about was, so @ @ in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six, uh, outputs and that's, um, basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either MFCC or PLP.\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd d: But one thing we could do is \nprofessor f: Let let me let me just ask you something. When you say take the fifty - six outputs, these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs\nphd d: Yeah. Through the regular tandem outputs.\nprofessor f: and they 're and through the KLT.\nphd d: Through the KLT. All that kinda stuff.\nprofessor f: OK. And so so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT\nphd d: That's what we did.\nprofessor f: or?\nphd d: Right? So one thing we were wondering is, if we did principal components and, say, took out just thirteen, and then did deltas and double - deltas on that \nprofessor f: OK. Yes.\nphd d: so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were standard features.\nprofessor f: Yes. Yeah.\nphd d: I mean, did Dan do experiments like that to?\nprofessor f: Uh. Talk with Stephane. He did some things like that. It was either him or Carmen. I forget.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor f: I mean these were all different databases and different you know, in HTK and all that,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor f: so i it it may not apply. But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse.\nphd d: Hmm.\nprofessor f: But, again, given all these differences, maybe it's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance, uh, components.\nphd d: Cuz in a sense, the net's already got quite a bit of context in those features,\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd d: so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those, we 're getting sort of even more.\nprofessor f: Which could be good or not.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor f: Yeah. Yeah. Worth trying.\nphd c: But there the main point is that, um, you know, it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now and I mean, there's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features uh, either generating them or feeding them to this to the SRI system,\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nphd c: but it's \nprofessor f: There might be, cuz that's a pretty big difference.\nphd c: Yeah. And I 'm wondering how we can how we can debug that.\nprofessor f: But\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: I mean how Um.\nprofessor f: Hmm.\nphd c: I 'm actually f quite sure that the feeding the features into the system and training it up,\nprofessor f: What if?\nphd c: that that I think that's this that's essentially the same as we use with the ce with the P L P fe features. And that's obviously working great. So. I um.\nphd d: Yeah. There could be a bug in in the somewhere before that.\nphd c: There we could the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the K L T transform?\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Right? We to\nprofessor f: That's \nphd d: Right.\nprofessor f: well, and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor f: These nets are trained with particular normalization and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it.\nphd d: I 'm doing what Eric E Eric coached me through then that part of it, so I 'm pretty confident in that.\nprofessor f: OK.\nphd d: I mean, the only slight difference is that I use normalization values that, um, Andreas calculated from the original PLP,\nphd c: Right.\nphd d: which is right.\nphd c: Right.\nphd d: N Yeah. So, I u I do Oh, we actually don't do that normalization for the PLP, do we? For the st just the straight PLP features?\nphd c: No. The the SRI system does it.\nphd d: S R I system does that. Right.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor f: Right. Well, you might e e\nphd c: So, there's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered,\nphd d: So that's that's another Yeah.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: Yeah. I I would actually double check with Stephane at this point,\nphd c: but \nprofessor f: cuz he's probably the one here I mean, he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: thing and there may there may be some little bit here and there that is not not being handled right.\nphd d: Yeah. It's hard with features, cuz you don't know what they should look like. I mean, you can't just, like, print the the values out in ASCII and, you know, look at them, see if they 're \nprofessor f: Not unless you had a lot of time\nphd g: Well \nprofessor f: and \nphd g: eh, and also they 're not I mean, as I understand it, you you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error. Right?\nphd c: Right.\nphd g: I mean, these are just discriminative, but they 're not, um, optimized for the final \nphd c: They 're optimized for phone discrimination, not for \nphd g: Right. So it there's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was a way to train it for the word error metric that you 're actually that you 're actually \nprofessor f: That's right. Well, the other Yeah, th the \nphd c: Mm - Mmm.\nprofessor f: Well, you actually are. But but it but in an indirect way.\nphd g: Well, right. It's indirect, so you don't know \nprofessor f: So wha w what an and you may not be in this case, come to think of it, because, uh, you 're just taking something that's trained up elsewhere. So, what what you what you do in the full procedure is you, um, uh, have an embedded training. So in fact you the the net is trained on, uh, uh, a, uh, Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system. And so that's where the feedback comes all around, so that it is actually discriminant. You can prove that it's it's a, uh If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that, uh, getting the best path, uh, is almost equivalent to getting the best, uh, total probability, um, then you actually do improve that by, uh by training up on local local, uh local frames. But, um, we aren't actually doing that here, because we did we did that for a hybrid system, and now we 're plugging it into another system and so it isn't i i i it wouldn't quite apply here.\nphd c: Do y\nphd d: So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features, uh, do SRI forced alignments using those features, and then re - do the net with those.\nprofessor f: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: Mmm, uh Exactly. Exactly.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd g: So that you can optimize it for the word error.\nphd c: But \nprofessor f: Yeah. Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation, it's probably bigger than it needs to be.\nphd g: Yeah.\nprofessor f: So that would save a lot of time.\nphd c: And there's a mismatch in the phone sets. So, you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what \nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor f: Yeah. Actually all those things could could could could, uh could affect it as well.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor f: The other thing, uh, just to mention that Stephane this was an innovation of Stephane's, which was a pretty neat one, uh, and might particularly apply here, given all these things we 're mentioning. Um, Stephane's idea was that, um, discriminant, uh, approaches are great. Even the local ones, given, you know, these potential outer loops which, you know, you can convince yourself turn into the global ones. Um, however, there's times when it is not good. Uh, when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that, uh, the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: So, uh, his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the, uh, Gaussian mixture system, uh, a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features.\nphd c: Oh, we already talked about that.\nphd g: Yeah. That \nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd c: El\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: Didn't you did you do that already\nphd c: Yeah. No, but we we when when we when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this, I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there.\nphd g: or? Oh. That makes a lot of sense. Huh.\nprofessor f: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it,\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor f: but actually Stephane did it\nphd c: Uh - huh. And i does it help?\nprofessor f: and and and it helped a lot.\nphd c: Oh, OK.\nprofessor f: Yeah. So that's that that's our current best best system in the, uh uh, in the Aurora thing.\nphd c: Oh. OK.\nphd g: Yeah. That makes sense.\nphd c: And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector?\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd g: As you should never do worse.\nprofessor f: I I, uh, missed what you said.\nphd c: Do you d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector?\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd c: OK.\nprofessor f: Well, actually, I, uh you should check with him, because he tried several different combinations.\nphd c: Because you end up with this huge feature vector, so that might be a problem, a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction.\nprofessor f: Yeah. I, uh, th what I don't remember is which came out best. So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT, and another one, since the the PLP things are already orthogonalized, he left them alone and and just did a KLT on the on the on the net outputs\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Mmm.\nprofessor f: and then concatenated that. And I don't remember which was better.\nphd d: Did he did he try to? So he always ended up with a feature vector that was twice as long as either one of the?\nprofessor f: No. I don't know, i I I don't know. You have to check with him.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: OK. Actually, I have to run.\nprofessor f: I 'm into big ideas these days.\nphd g: Yeah.\nphd c: Uh.\nphd g: We need to close up cuz I need to save the data and, um, get a call.\nprofessor f: Not to mention the fact that we 're missing snacks. Yeah.\nphd g: Right.\nprofessor f: Uh\nphd g: Did people wanna do the digits\nprofessor f: Um.\nphd g: or, um, do them together?\nprofessor f: I I g I think, given that we 're in a hurry for snacks, maybe we should do them together.\nphd g: I don't know. Should we just? OK. I mean, are we trying to do them in synchrony? That might be fun.\nprofessor f: Well, it's it's it's not You know, it's not gonna work out\nphd g: Adam's not here, so he's not here to tell me no.\nprofessor f: but we could we could just, uh, uh, see if we find a rhythm, you know, what \nphd g: Sure.\nprofessor f: Uh, O's or zeroes, we wanna agree on that?\nphd g: Maybe just whatever people would naturally do? I don't know.\nprofessor f: Oh, but if we were a singing group, we would wanna decide. Right?\nphd g: Be harmony. Yeah. Yeah.\npostdoc a: Mine's identical to yours.\nprofessor f: We might wa\npostdoc a: Is that correct?\nphd g: Sorry. So I set up and we didn't have enough digit forms\npostdoc a: Oh.

Is zero OK?\nphd g: No.\npostdoc a: Yeah.\nprofessor f: OK. One and a two and three.\nphd g: e\nprofessor f: Once more with feeling.\nphd g: And th\nprofessor f: No, just k just kidding. Oh, yeah.

You got you just wrote a bunch of stuff.\nphd g: No. That was all, um, previously here.\nprofessor f: Oh.\nphd g: I was writing the digits and then I realized I could xerox them,\nprofessor f: Oh, oh.", "en_query": "What was said on transcripts?", "zh_query": "关于转录说了什么？", "fr_query": "Qu'a-t-il été dit sur les transcriptions ?", "ukr_query": "Що було сказано щодо транскрипцій?

{"fname": "academic_test_48", "dialogue": "professor f: Yeah. An - and the other thing is, I mean, in the unlikely event and since we 're so far from this, it's a little hard to plan this way in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have, uh, transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because, you know, there's, you know, all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're and they 're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh, than the generation, um, eh, i in in the day e event that that day actually dawns, uh, I I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do.\npostdoc a: Oh, yes.\nprofessor f: So I I think that, eh, eh, a as we were talking, if we if we hire twelve, then we could, you know, run into a problem later. I mean, we also just couldn't sustain that forever. But but, um for all sorts of reasons but if we hire f you know, f we have five on staff five or six on staff at any given time, then it's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way.\npostdoc a: Good. OK.\nprofessor f: Good.\nphd g: It 'd be great, too, if, um, we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand to experiment with, um you know, to have a ground truth for this segmentation work, which I guess you have some already that was really helpful, and we could probably use more.\nphd e: Mmm, yeah. That was a thing I I planned working on, is, uh, to use the the transcriptions which are done by now, and to to use them as, uh \nphd g: Oh. Oh, the new ones\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: with the tighter boundaries. Yeah.\nphd e: Yeah. And to use them for for training a or for fo whatever. Yeah. To to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them, and Yeah, but that that's a thing w was w what I 'm just looking into.\nphd g: OK.\npostdoc a: The the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful. Now there was, uh, I g guess So, a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation f for just very few days you were away. But it happened to be during that time I needed one,\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: so I so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and, um, they, um you know, they always appreciate that when they have that available. And he's, uh, usually, eh, uh, um Um. So they really appreciate it. But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while. You know, once in a while there's something like,\nphd e: Yeah, sure.\npostdoc a: um, and e Actually you talked to them. Didn't you? Did you? Have you?\nphd e: Yeah. I talked to Helen.\npostdoc a: And and and she was And so, I asked her I mean, They 're very perceptive. I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers. I haven't done it yet, but I wanna do that and she's out of town, um, for a couple of weeks, but I wanna do that when she returns. Um, cuz she was saying, you know, in a in a span of very short period we asked It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these these these things, and she was saying the short utterances, uh, the, um \nphd g: Hmm.\nphd e: Mmm. Yeah.\npostdoc a: you know, I mean, you 're You 're aware of this. But but actually i it's so correct for so much of the time, that it's an enormous time saver\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries. So.\nphd g: That's great.\npostdoc a: Um. Yeah. I think it 'd be interesting to combine these.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: Is there actually a record of where they change? I mean, you can compare, do a diff on the just so that we knew \npostdoc a: You could do it. It's it's complicated in that um, hhh, i hhh, i\nphd e: Yeah. Actually, when when they create new yeah, new segments or something, it will be, uh, not that easy but hmm. I think one could do that.\nphd g: I mean, if we keep a old copy of the old time marks\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: just so that if we run it we know whether we 're which ones were cheating\nphd e: Yeah. Yeah. That would be great, yeah, to know that.\nphd g: and\npostdoc a: There is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version.\nphd g: which one would be good.\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: So it's not a pure it's not a pure condition. Wha - what you 'd really like is that they started with pre - segmented and were pre - segmented all the way through.\nphd g: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc a: And, um @ @  I, uh the it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones. But, it will be possible in the future\nphd e: Yeah.\npostdoc a: because we we 're, um.\nphd e: It would.\nphd g: Mmm, that's great.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: Yeah. As long as we have a record, I guess, of the original automatic one, we can always find out how well we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries.\nphd e: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd g: Um.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: You know, a completely non - cheating version.\nphd e: Yeah.\nphd g: Also if you need someone to record this meeting, I mean, I 'm happy to for the transcribers I could do it, or Chuck or Adam.\npostdoc a: Thank you.\nprofessor f: OK. So, uh, u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info?\nphd d: Yeah. So, um, uh, Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting \nprofessor f: Did you record it?\nphd d: No. For all the Meeting Recorder data. We should have. Um. And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there. And then, Jane also s prepared a um, started getting all of the the meetings organized, so she prepared a a spreadsheet, which I spent the last couple of days adding to. So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far, and have been putting it into, uh, a spreadsheet with start time, the date, the old meeting name, the new meeting name, the number of speakers, the duration of the meeting, comments, you know, what its transcription status is, all that kind of stuff. And so, the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what's going on.\nphd g: Oh, great.\nphd d: Um, I 've gotta get some more information from Jane cuz I have some some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in, but so far, um, as of Monday, the fourteenth, um, we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected. And, um Uh, some other interesting things, average number of speakers per meeting is six. Um, and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that's been transcribed so far, but I 've got a bunch of uh, that's what I have to talk to Jane about, figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth. But, um, this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones. And it 'll also list, uh, like under the status, if it's at IBM or if it's at ICSI, uh, or if it's completed or which ones we 're excluding and and there's a place for comments, so we can, um, say why we 're excluding things and so forth. So.\nprofessor f: Now would the ones that, um, are already transcribed we h we have enough there that c you know, we 've already done some studies and so forth and um, shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of of having the, um, uh, participants approve it, uh, for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth?\npostdoc a: Um, interesting idea. In principle, I I would say yes, although I still am doing some the final - pass editing, trying to convert it over to the master file as the being the channelized version and it's Yeah, it seems like I get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes and I have to stop. Cleaning up the things like the, uh, uh, places where the transcriber was uncertain, and and doing spot - checking here and there. So, um, uh, I guess it would make sense to wait until th that's done, um, but but \nprofessor f: Well, le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as I did with the, uh, uh the the pipeline.\npostdoc a: Yeah.\nprofessor f: Um, we are gonna have this DARPA meeting in the middle of July,\npostdoc a: Yes.\nprofessor f: and I think it w it 'd be given that we 've been we 've given a couple public talks about it already, spaced by months and months, I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available. Um.\npostdoc a: It 'll certainly be done by then. Yeah.\nprofessor f: Right. So we can s we we wanna be able to say \" here is a subset that is available right now \"\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm. That's right.\nprofessor f: and that's has been through the legal issues and so forth.\npostdoc a: That's right.\nprofessor f: So.\npostdoc a: Yeah. That's right. So that \nprofessor f: OK?\npostdoc a: OK.\nprofessor f: So, by before July.\nphd c: And they don't have to approve, you know, th an edited version, they can just give their approval to whatever version\npostdoc a: Well, maybe \nprofessor f: Well, in principle, yes. But, I mean, i if if if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we\nphd c: Bu Yeah. But th I mean, the editing will continue. Presumably if if s errors are found, they will be fixed, but they won't change the the content of the meetings.\nphd d: Content, really.\npostdoc a: Well, see, this is the this is the issue. Subtleties.\nphd c: So.\nphd g: Well, i if Jane is clarifying question question, then, you know, how can they agree to it before they know her final version?\npostdoc a: The other thing, too, is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word, which @ @ could 've been transcribed in the other way.\nprofessor f: Yeah.\nphd g: Thing \npostdoc a: And no and they wouldn't have been slanderous if it had been this other word. You know?\nprofessor f: I it you know, there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous because, you know, you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say, you know, that should be a period and not a question mark. Right? And you don't you there's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody \" do you approve this, uh, you know this document now? \" So So I think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign I I haven't looked at it in a while, but it has to be open enough that it sort of says \" OK, from now on you know, now that I 've read this, you can use do anything you want with these data. \"\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor f: And, uh But, i I think we wanna So, assuming that it's in that kind of wording, which I don't remember, um, I think i we just wanna have enough confidence ourselves that it's so close to the final form it's gonna be in, a year from now that they 're \npostdoc a: Mm - hmm. I agree. Mmm. I totally agree. It's just, uh, a question of, uh, if if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous, then it seems like it's it's i it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re - listening to the meeting.\nprofessor f: Uh.\npostdoc a: Because it becomes, eh, in a way a a f uh, a legal document i if they 've agreed to that.", "en_query": "What was the status of transcription?", "zh_query": "转录情况如何？", "fr_query": "Quel était l'état de la transcription ?", "ukr_query": "Яким був статус транскрипції?", "en_summary": "The final english SmartKom demo will be presented to the whole institute once the system is de-bugged and stabilised.", "zh_summary": "一旦系统调试完毕并保持稳定，团队将会在全院进行最终的英语版SmartKom演示。", "fr_summary": "La démo finale de SmartKom en anglais sera présentée à l'ensemble de l'institut une fois le système débogué et stabilisé.", "ukr_summary": "Після того, як систему буде відлагоджено і стабілізовано,​​ всьому інституту буде представлена остаточна англійська демо-версія SmartKom."}

Test? Test? OK, I guess it's alright. So, let's see. Yeah, Barry's not here and Dave's not here. Um, I can say about just q just quickly to get through it, that Dave and I submitted this ASRU.\nphd a: This is for ASRU.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So. Um. Yeah, it's it's interesting. I mean, basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation, and, um, when we deal with pure reverberation, the technique he's using works really, really well. Uh, and when they had the reverberation here, uh, we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it's, uh, about nine DB. So,\nphd d: Hmm.\nprofessor b: um,\nphd a: You mean, from the actual, uh, recordings?\nprofessor b: a fair amount of \nphd d: k\nphd a: It's nine DB?\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. Um And actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the Aurora stuff too. Um, I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale, there was some experimentation that went on at at, uh at OGI. Um, but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using, the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh, other system we were using, the uh, the SRI system, was that the SRI system had maybe a, um, hundred hertz high - pass. And the, uh, Aurora HTK, it was like twenty.\nphd d: Yep. S sixty - four.\nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd d: S sixty - four.\nprofessor b: Sixty - four? Uh.\nphd d: Yeah, if you 're using the baseline.\nprofessor b: Is that the ba band center?\nphd d: No, the edge.\nprofessor b: The edge is really, uh, sixty - four?\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: For some reason, uh, Dave thought it was twenty,\nphd d: So the, uh, center would be somewhere around like hundred\nprofessor b: but.\nphd d: and hundred and hundred hundred and maybe it's like fi hundred hertz.\nprofessor b: But do you know, for instance, h how far down it would be at twenty hertz? What the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz, let's say?\nphd d: At twenty hertz.\nprofessor b: Yeah, any idea what the curve looks like?\nphd d: Twenty hertz frequency Oh, it's it's zero at twenty hertz, right? The filter?\nphd c: Yea - actually, the left edge of the first filter is at sixty - four.\nphd d: Sixt - s sixty - four.\nphd c: So \nphd d: So anything less than sixty - four is zero.\nphd c: Mmm.\nprofessor b: It's actually set to zero? What kind of filter is that?\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Is this oh, from the from \nphd c: It This is the filter bank in the frequency domain that starts at sixty - four.\nprofessor b: Oh, so you, uh so you really set it to zero, the FFT?\nphd d: Yeah,\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: yeah. So it's it's a weight on the ball spectrum. Triangular weighting.\nprofessor b: Right. OK. Um OK. So that's that's a little different than Dave thought, I think. But but, um, still, it's possible that we 're getting in some more noise. So I wonder, is it @ @ Was there their experimentation with, uh, say, throwing away that filter or something? And, uh \nphd d: Uh, throwing away the first?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Um, yeah, we we 've tried including the full full bank. Right? From zero to four K.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And that's always worse than using sixty - four hertz.\nprofessor b: Right, but the question is, whether sixty - four hertz is is, uh, too, uh, low.\nphd d: Yeah, I mean, make it a hundred or so?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: I t I think I 've tried a hundred and it was more or less the same, or slightly worse.\nprofessor b: On what test set?\nphd d: On the same, uh, SpeechDat - Car, Aurora.\nprofessor b: Um, it was on the SpeechDat - Car.\nphd d: Yeah. So I tried a hundred to four K. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Um,\nphd d: So it was \nprofessor b: and on and on the, um, um, TI - digits also?\nphd d: No, no, no. I think I just tried it on SpeechDat - Car.\nprofessor b: Mmm. That 'd be something to look at sometime because what, um, eh, he was looking at was performance in this room.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Would that be more like Well, you 'd think that 'd be more like SpeechDat - Car, I guess, in terms of the noise. The SpeechDat - Car is more, uh, sort of roughly stationary, a lot of it. And and TI - digits maybe is not so much as \nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm. OK. Well, maybe it's not a big deal. But, um Anyway, that was just something we wondered about. But, um, uh, certainly a lot of the noise, uh, is, uh, below a hundred hertz. Uh, the signal - to - noise ratio, you know, looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: But, um but it's still pretty noisy. Even even for a hundred hertz up, it's it's still fairly noisy. The signal - to - noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: So, um, I mean, the main the the \nphd a: So that's on th that's on the f the far field ones though, right? Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah, that's on the far field. Yeah, the near field's pretty good.\nphd a: So wha what is, uh what's causing that?\nprofessor b: Well, we got a a video projector in here, uh, and, uh which we keep on during every every session we record,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: which, you know, I I w we were aware of\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: but but we thought it wasn't a bad thing.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean, that's a nice noise source. Uh, and there's also the, uh uh, air conditioning.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: Which, uh, you know, is a pretty low frequency kind of thing.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But but, uh So, those are those are major components, I think,\nphd a: I see.\nprofessor b: uh, for the stationary kind of stuff.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor b: Um, but, um, it, uh I guess, I maybe I said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise. And, uh, so I think when when he gets done with his prelim study I think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this, uh uh, noise, uh, processing stuff and and, uh uh, synthesize some speech from it.\nphd a: When are his prelims?\nprofessor b: And then Um, I think in about, um, a little less than two weeks.\nphd a: Oh. Wow.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. So. Uh, it might even be sooner. Uh, let's see, this is the sixteenth, seventeenth? Yeah, I don't know if he's before It might even be in a week.\nphd a: So, I\nprofessor b: A week,\nphd a: Huh. I I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester\nprofessor b: week and a half.\nphd a: but they 'll do it any time, huh?\nprofessor b: They seem to be Well, the semester actually is starting up.\nphd a: Is it already?\nprofessor b: Yeah, the semester's late late August they start here.\nphd a: Yikes.\nprofessor b: So they do it right at the beginning of the semester.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So, uh Yep. I mean, that that was sort of one I mean, the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either, um, artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set. Uh, either way, uh, i uh, it helped a lot. And But if you had a a really big training set, a recognizer, uh, system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set I thought that One thing with the HTK is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of Aurora, we have all those parameters just set as they are. So even if we had a hundred times as much data, we wouldn't go out to, you know, ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything. So, um, it's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data. Uh, whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Mmm, yeah.\nprofessor b: It does it automatically, actually. And so, um, uh, that one really benefited from the larger set. And it was also a diverse set with different noises and so forth. Uh, so, um, that, uh that seemed to be So, if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameters, and if you, um, have the natural room, which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio, then in that case, um, the right thing to do is just do u use speaker adaptation. And and not bother with with this acoustic, uh, processing. But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as, uh, the convolutional kind of things we were doing.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So. That's sort of what we found.\nphd d: Hmm.\nphd a: I, um uh, started working on the uh Mississippi State recognizer. So, I got in touch with Joe and and, uh, from your email and things like that.\nphd d: Oh, OK.\nphd a: And, uh, they added me to the list uh, the mailing list.\nphd d: OK, great.\nphd a: And he gave me all of the pointers and everything that I needed. And so I downloaded the, um There were two things, uh, that they had to download. One was the, uh, I guess the software. And another wad was a, um, sort of like a sample a sample run. So I downloaded the software and compiled all of that. And it compiled fine.\nphd d: Eight.\nphd a: No problems.\nphd d: Oh, eh, great.\nphd a: And, um, I grabbed the sample stuff but I haven't, uh, compiled it.\nphd d: That sample was released only yesterday or the day before, right?\nphd a: No Well, I haven't grabbed that one yet. So there's two.\nphd d: Oh, there is another short sample set \nphd a: There was another short one, yeah.\nphd d: o o sample.\nphd a: And so I haven't grabbed the latest one that he just, uh, put out yet.\nphd d: OK. Oh, OK. F Yeah, OK.\nphd a: So. Um, but, the software seemed to compile fine and everything, so. And, um, So.\nprofessor b: Is there any word yet about the issues about, um, adjustments for different feature sets or anything?\nphd a: No, I I d You asked me to write to him and I think I forgot to ask him about that. Or if I did ask him, he didn't reply.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: I I don't remember yet. Uh, I 'll I 'll d I 'll double check that and ask him again.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah, it's like that that could r turn out to be an important issue for us.\nphd d: Hmm. Mmm.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Cuz they have it \nphd a: Maybe I 'll send it to the list. Yeah.\nphd d: Cuz they have, uh, already frozen those in i insertion penalties and all those stuff is what I feel. Because they have this document explaining the recognizer.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd d: And they have these tables with, uh, various language model weights, insertion penalties.\nphd a: OK, I haven't seen that one yet.\nphd d: u\nphd a: So.\nphd d: Uh, it's th it's there on that web.\nphd a: OK.\nphd d: And, uh, on that, I mean, they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those \nphd a: And so they 've picked the values.\nphd d: Yeah, I think they pi p\nphd a: Oh, OK.\nphd d: yeah, they picked the values from \nphd a: OK.\nprofessor b: For r w what test set?\nphd d: Uh, p the one that they have reported is a NIST evaluation, Wall Street Journal.\nprofessor b: But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on, right?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: You know. No. So they 're, like um So they are actually trying to, uh, fix that those values using the clean, uh, training part of the Wall Street Journal. Which is I mean, the Aurora. Aurora has a clean subset.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: I mean, they want to train it and then this they 're going to run some evaluations.\nprofessor b: So they 're set they 're setting it based on that?\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK. So now, we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modify these parameters.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: But, um,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: uh but it's still worth, I think, just since you know, just chatting with Joe about the issue.\nphd a: Yeah, OK. Do you think that's something I should just send to him\nprofessor b: Um \nphd a: or do you think I should send it to this there's an a m a mailing list.\nprofessor b: Well, it's not a secret. I mean, we 're, you know, certainly willing to talk about it with everybody, but I think I think that, um um, it's probably best to start talking with him just to \nphd a: OK.\nprofessor b: Uh @ @ you know, it's a dialogue between two of you about what you know, what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it.\nphd a: Yeah. OK.\nprofessor b: Um, if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on, you know, how \nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: you know.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: Uh But, I mean, I think it all should come up eventually,\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor b: but if if if there is any, uh, uh, way to move in a way that would that would, you know, be more open to different kinds of features. But if if, uh if there isn't, and it's just kind of shut down and and then also there's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in.\nphd a: Yeah. OK.\nphd d: Oh. So this is now it's it's compiled under Solaris?\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah, OK.\nphd a: Yep.\nphd d: Because he there was some mail r saying that it's may not be stable for Linux and all those.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah, i that was a particular version.\nphd d: SUSI\nphd a: Yeah, SUSI or whatever it was\nphd d: yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nphd a: but we don't have that.\nphd d: Yeah, OK.\nphd a: So. Should be OK.\nphd d: OK, that's fine.\nphd a: Yeah, it compiled fine actually.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: No no errors. Nothing. So.\nprofessor b: Uh, this is slightly off topic\nphd d: That's good.\nprofessor b: but, uh, I noticed, just glancing at the, uh, Hopkins workshop, uh, web site that, uh, um one of the thing I don't know Well, we 'll see how much they accomplish, but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a, uh, tool kit for doing, uh r um, arbitrary graphical models for, uh, speech recognition.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: So And Jeff, uh the two Jeffs were\nphd a: Who's the second Jeff?\nprofessor b: Uh Oh, uh, do you know Geoff Zweig?\nphd a: No.\nprofessor b: Oh. Uh, he he, uh he was here for a couple years\nphd a: Oh, OK.\nprofessor b: and he, uh got his PHD. He And he's, uh, been at IBM for the last couple years.\nphd a: Oh, OK.\nprofessor b: So.\nphd a: Wow. That would be neat.\nprofessor b: Uh, so he did he did his PHD on dynamic Bayes - nets, uh, for for speech recognition. He had some continuity built into the model, presumably to handle some, um, inertia in the in the production system, and, um \nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: So.\nphd d: Hmm.\nphd c: Um, I 've been playing with, first, the, um, VAD. Um, so it's exactly the same approach, but the features that the VAD neural network use are, uh, MFCC after noise compensation. Oh, I think I have the results.\nprofessor b: What was it using before?\nphd c: Before it was just P L\nphd d: \nphd c: So.\nphd d: Yeah, it was actually No. Not I mean, it was just the noisy features I guess.\nphd c: Yeah,\nphd d: Yeah, yeah, yeah,\nphd c: noisy noisy features.\nphd d: not compensated.\nphd c: Um This is what we get after This So, actually, we, yeah, here the features are noise compensated and there is also the LDA filter. Um, and then it's a pretty small neural network which use, um, nine frames of of six features from C - zero to C - fives, plus the first derivatives. And it has one hundred hidden units.\nphd a: Is that nine frames u s uh, centered around the current frame? Or \nphd c: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: S so, I 'm I 'm sorry, there's there's there's how many how many inputs?\nphd c: So it's twelve times nine.\nprofessor b: Twelve times nine inputs, and a hundred, uh, hidden.\nphd c: Hidden and\nphd d: Two outputs.\nphd c: two outputs.\nprofessor b: Two outputs. OK. So I guess about eleven thousand parameters, which actually shouldn't be a problem, even in in small phones. Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So, I 'm I 'm s so what is different between this and and what you \nphd c: It should be OK. So the previous syst It's based on the system that has a fifty - three point sixty - six percent improvement. It's the same system. The only thing that changed is the n a p eh a es the estimation of the silence probabilities.\nphd a: Ah. OK.\nphd c: Which now is based on, uh, cleaned features.\nprofessor b: And, it's a l it's a lot better.\nphd a: Wow.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: That's great.\nphd c: Um So it's it's not bad, but the problem is still that the latency is too large.\nprofessor b: What's the latency?\nphd c: Because um the the latency of the VAD is two hundred and twenty milliseconds. And, uh, the VAD is used uh, i for on - line normalization, and it's used before the delta computation. So if you add these components it goes t to a hundred and seventy, right?\nprofessor b: I I 'm confused. You started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy?\nphd c: With two an two hundred and seventy.\nprofessor b: Two - seventy.\nphd c: If Yeah, if you add the c delta comp delta computation\nprofessor b: Oh.\nphd c: which is done afterwards. Um \nprofessor b: So it's two - twenty. I the is this are these twenty - millisecond frames? Is that why? Is it after downsampling? or \nphd c: The two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um No, it's forty milliseconds for t for the, uh, uh, cleaning of the speech. Um then there is, um, the neural network which use nine frames. So it adds forty milliseconds.\nprofessor b: a OK.\nphd c: Um, after that, um, you have the um, filtering of the silence probabilities. Which is a million filter it, and it creates a one hundred milliseconds delay. So, um \nprofessor b: \nphd d: Plus there is a delta at the input.\nphd c: Yeah, and there is the delta at the input which is,\nprofessor b: One hundred milliseconds for smoothing.\nphd c: um So it's @ @ \nprofessor b: Uh, median.\nphd c: \nphd d: It's like forty plus forty plus \nprofessor b: And then forty \nphd c: Mmm. Forty This forty plus twenty, plus one hundred.\nprofessor b: forty p \nphd c: Uh \nphd d: So it's two hundred actually.\nphd c: Yeah, there are twenty that comes from There is ten that comes from the LDA filters also. Right?\nphd d: Oh, OK.\nphd c: Uh, so it's two hundred and ten, yeah.\nphd d: If you are using \nprofessor b: Uh \nphd c: Plus the frame,\nphd d: t If you are using three frames \nphd c: so it's two - twenty.\nphd d: If you are phrasing f using three frames, it is thirty here for delta.\nphd c: Yeah, I think it's it's five frames, but.\nphd d: So five frames, that's twenty. OK, so it's who un two hundred and ten.\nprofessor b: Uh, p Wait a minute. It's forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech,\nphd c: So. Forty cleaning.\nprofessor b: forty for the I N ANN, a hundred for the smoothing.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Well, but at ten ,\nphd c: Twenty for the delta.\nprofessor b: Twenty for delta.\nphd d: At th At the input. I mean, that's at the input to the net.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Delta at input to net?\nphd d: And there i\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah. So it's like s five, six cepstrum plus delta at nine nine frames of \nprofessor b: And then ten milliseconds for \nphd d: Fi - There's an LDA filter.\nprofessor b: ten milliseconds for LDA filter, and t and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame?\nphd c: For the frame I guess. I computed two - twenty Yeah, well, it's I guess it's for the fr the \nprofessor b: OK. And then there's delta besides that?\nphd c: So this is the features that are used by our network and then afterwards, you have to compute the delta on the, uh, main feature stream,\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd c: which is um, delta and double - deltas, which is fifty milliseconds.\nprofessor b: Yeah. No, I mean, the after the noise part, the forty the the other hundred and eighty Well, I mean, Wait a minute. Some of this is, uh is, uh is in parallel, isn't it? I mean, the LDA Oh, you have the LDA as part of the V D - uh, VAD? Or \nphd c: The VAD use, uh, LDA filtered features also.\nprofessor b: Oh, it does?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Ah. So in that case there isn't too much in parallel. Uh \nphd c: No. There is, um, just downsampling, upsampling, and the LDA.\nprofessor b: Um, so the delta at the end is how much?\nphd c: It's fifty.\nphd d: It's \nprofessor b: Fifty. Alright. So \nphd c: But well, we could probably put the delta, um, before on - line normalization. It should not that make a big difference,\nphd a: What if you used a smaller window for the delta?\nphd c: because \nphd a: Could that help a little bit? I mean, I guess there's a lot of things you could do to \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah,\nprofessor b: So\nphd c: but, nnn \nprofessor b: Yeah. So if you if you put the delta before the, uh, ana on - line If Yeah \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: uh then then it could go in parallel.\nphd c: Cuz i\nprofessor b: And then y then you don't have that additive \nphd c: Yeah,\nphd d: Yep.\nphd c: cuz the time constant of the on - line normalization is pretty long compared to the delta window,\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd c: so. It should not make \nprofessor b: OK. And you ought to be able to shove tw, uh sh uh pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred, right? I mean \nphd a: Is two hundred the d\nprofessor b: The hundred milla\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount. It could be eighty and and probably do @ @ \nphd c: Yeah,\nphd a: i a hun\nphd c: yeah.\nphd a: uh Wh - what's the baseline you need to be under? Two hundred?\nprofessor b: Well, we don't know. They 're still arguing about it.\nphd c: \nphd a: Oh.\nprofessor b: I mean, if it's two if if it's, uh if it's two - fifty, then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty. If it's two hundred, if we shaved off twenty, we could we could, uh, meet it by moving the delta back.\nphd a: So, how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding?\nprofessor b: Uh, we don't, but it's just I mean, the main thing is that since that we got burned last time, and you know, by not worrying about it very much, we 're just staying conscious of it.\nphd a: Uh - huh. Oh, OK, I see.\nprofessor b: And so, th I mean, if if if a week before we have to be done someone says, \" Well, you have to have fifty milliseconds less than you have now \", it would be pretty frantic around here. So \nphd a: Ah, OK.\nprofessor b: Uh \nphd a: But still, that's that's a pretty big, uh, win. And it doesn't seem like you 're in terms of your delay, you 're, uh, that \nprofessor b: He added a bit on, I guess, because before we were we were had were able to have the noise, uh, stuff, uh, and the LVA be in parallel.\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor b: And now he's he's requiring it to be done first.\nphd c: Well, but I think the main thing, maybe, is the cleaning of the speech, which takes forty milliseconds or so.\nprofessor b: Right. Well, so you say let's say ten milliseconds seconds for the LDA.\nphd c: And and but the LDA is, well, pretty short right now.\nprofessor b: Well, ten. And then forty for the other.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah, the LDA LDA we don't know, is, like is it very crucial for the features, right?\nphd c: No. I just This is the first try.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Right,\nphd c: I mean, I maybe the LDA's not very useful then.\nprofessor b: so you could start pulling back,\nphd d: S s h\nprofessor b: but \nphd d: Yeah,\nprofessor b: But I think you have \nphd d: l\nprofessor b: I mean, you have twenty for delta computation which y now you 're sort of doing twice, right? But yo w were you doing that before?\nphd c: Mmm. Well, in the proposal, um, the input of the VAD network were just three frames, I think.\nphd d: On the in the Mm - hmm. Just Yeah, just the static, no delta.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd c: Uh, static features.\nprofessor b: So, what you have now is fort uh, forty for the the noise, twenty for the delta, and ten for the LDA. That's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel,\nphd c: \nprofessor b: right? So I think,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: you know, that's that's the difference as far as the timing, right?\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Um, and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit, but I mean, we 're s we 're not we 're not in terrible shape.\nphd a: Yeah, that's what it seems like to me. It's pretty good.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: It's it's not like it's adding up to four hundred milliseconds or something.\nphd a: Where where is this where is this fifty - seven point O two in in comparison to the last evaluation?\nprofessor b: Well, it's I think it's better than anything, uh, anybody got.\nphd a: Oh, is that right?\nphd c: Yeah. The best was fifty - four point five.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Point s\nphd a: Oh.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Uh\nphd c: And our system was forty - nine, but with the neural network.\nphd a: Wow. So this is almost ten percent.\nprofessor b: With the f with the neural net. Yeah, and r and \nphd c: It would\nphd d: Yeah, so this is this is like the first proposal. The proposal - one. It was forty - four, actually.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. And we still don't have the neural net in. So so it's \nphd a: Wow.\nprofessor b: You know. So it's We 're we 're doing better.\nphd a: This is this is really good.\nprofessor b: I mean, we 're getting better recognition. I mean, I 'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either, but \nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: but but, uh Uh, I mean, the important thing is that we learn how to do this better, and, you know. So. Um, Yeah. So, our, um Yeah, you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having, say, on SpeechDat - Car which is a hard task, cuz it's really, um I think it's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers, starting to be. I mean, it's still terri\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yeah, even for a well - matched case it's sixty percent error rate reduction,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: which is \nprofessor b: Yeah. Probably half. Good!\nphd c: Um, Yeah. So actually, this is in between what we had with the previous VAD and what Sunil did with an IDL VAD. Which gave sixty - two percent improvement, right?\nphd d: Yeah, it's almost that.\nphd c: So \nphd d: It's almost an average somewhere around \nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: What was that? Say that last part again?\nphd c: So, if you use, like, an IDL VAD, uh, for dropping the frames,\nphd d: o o Or the best we can get.\nphd c: the best that we can get i That means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances. Then you can go up to sixty - two percent error rate reduction, globally.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: Mmm Yeah.\nphd a: So that would be even That wouldn't change this number down here to sixty - two?\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So you you were get\nphd c: If you add a g good v very good VAD, that works as well as a VAD working on clean speech,\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd c: then you wou you would go \nphd a: So that's sort of the best you could hope for.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I see.\nprofessor b: Probably. Yeah. So fi si fifty - three is what you were getting with the old VAD.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And, uh and sixty - two with the the, you know, quote, unquote, cheating VAD. And fifty - seven is what you got with the real VAD.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: That's great.\nphd c: Uh, yeah, the next thing is, I started to play Well, I don't want to worry too much about the delay, no. Maybe it's better to wait\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd c: for the decision\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: from the committee. Uh, but I started to play with the, um, uh, tandem neural network. Mmm I just did the configuration that's very similar to what we did for the February proposal. And Um. So. There is a f a first feature stream that use uh straight MFCC features.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Well, these features actually. And the other stream is the output of a neural network, using as input, also, these, um, cleaned MFCC. Um \nphd a: Those are th those are th what is going into the tandem net?\nphd c: I don't have the comp Mmm?\nphd a: Those two?\nphd c: So there is just this feature stream, the fifteen MFCC plus delta and double - delta.\nprofessor b: No.\nphd a: Yeah?\nphd c: Um, so it's makes forty - five features that are used as input to the HTK. And then, there is there are more inputs that comes from the tandem MLP.\nphd a: Oh, oh. OK. I see.\nprofessor b: Yeah, h he likes to use them both,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: cuz then it has one part that's discriminative,\nphd c: Yeah. Um \nprofessor b: one part that's not.\nphd a: Right. OK.\nphd c: So, um, uh, yeah. Right now it seems that i I just tested on SpeechDat - Car while the experiment are running on your on TI - digits. Well, it improves on the well - matched and the mismatched conditions, but it get worse on the highly mismatched. Um,\nphd a: Compared to these numbers?\nphd c: Compared to these numbers, yeah. Um,\nprofessor b: y\nphd c: like, on the well - match and medium mismatch, the gain is around five percent relative, but it goes down a lot more, like fifteen percent on the HM case.\nprofessor b: You 're just using the full ninety features?\nphd c: The \nprofessor b: Y you have ninety features?\nphd c: i I have, um From the networks, it's twenty - eight. So \nprofessor b: And from the other side it's forty - five.\nphd c: So, d i It's forty - five.\nprofessor b: So it's you have seventy - three features,\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and you 're just feeding them like that.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: There isn't any KLT or anything?\nphd c: Mm - hmm. There's a KLT after the neural network, as as before.\nphd a: That's how you get down to twenty - eight?\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Why twenty - eight?\nphd c: I don't know.\nphd a: Oh.\nphd c: Uh. It's i i i It's because it's what we did for the first proposal. We tested, uh, trying to go down\nphd a: Ah.\nprofessor b: It's a multiple of seven.\nphd c: and Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: So Um.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: I wanted to do something very similar to the proposal as a first first try.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: I see.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. That makes sense.\nphd c: But we have to for sure, we have to go down, because the limit is now sixty features.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: So, uh, we have to find a way to decrease the number of features. Um \nphd a: So, it seems funny that I don't know, maybe I don't u quite understand everything, but that adding features I guess I guess if you 're keeping the back - end fixed. Maybe that's it. Because it seems like just adding information shouldn't give worse results. But I guess if you 're keeping the number of Gaussians fixed in the recognizer, then \nprofessor b: Well, yeah.\nphd c: Mmm.\nprofessor b: But, I mean, just in general, adding information Suppose the information you added, well, was a really terrible feature and all it brought in was noise.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Right? So so, um Or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible, but it was completely equivalent to another one feature that you had, except it was noisier.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: Right? In that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all.\nphd a: Oh, yeah, I wasn't necessarily saying it should be better. I 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel\nprofessor b: Uh - huh.\nphd c: But it's worse.\nprofessor b: On the highly mismatched condition.\nphd a: On the highly mismatch.\nphd c: Yeah, I \nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So, \" highly mismatched condition \" means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test.\nphd c: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: So having having, uh, a g a l a greater number of features, if they aren't maybe the right features that you use, certainly can e can easily, uh, make things worse. I mean, you 're right. If you have if you have, uh, lots and lots of data, and you have and your your your training is representative of your test, then getting more sources of information should just help. But but it's It doesn't necessarily work that way.\nphd a: Huh.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So I wonder, um, Well, what's your what's your thought about what to do next with it?\nphd c: Um, I don't know. I 'm surprised, because I expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch, as it was the case for the \nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: So, was the training set same as the p the February proposal? OK.\nphd c: Yeah, it's the same training set, so it's TIMIT with the TI - digits ', uh, noises, uh, added.\nphd d: \nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Um \nprofessor b: Well, we might uh, we might have to experiment with, uh better training sets. Again. But,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I The other thing is, I mean, before you found that was the best configuration, but you might have to retest those things now that we have different The rest of it is different, right? So, um, uh, For instance, what's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean, you know what the straight features do.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: That gives you this. You know what it does in combination.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: You don't necessarily know what \nphd a: What if you did the Would it make sense to do the KLT on the full set of combined features? Instead of just on the \nphd c: Yeah. I g I guess. Um. The reason I did it this ways is that in February, it we we tested different things like that, so, having two KLT, having just a KLT for a network, or having a global KLT.\nphd a: Oh, I see.\nphd c: And \nphd a: So you tried the global KLT before\nphd c: Well \nphd a: and it didn't really \nphd c: Yeah. And, uh, th Yeah.\nphd a: I see.\nphd c: The differences between these configurations were not huge, but it was marginally better with this configuration.\nphd a: Uh - huh. Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: But, yeah, that's obviously another thing to try,\nphd c: Um.\nprofessor b: since things are things are different.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And I guess if the These are all so all of these seventy - three features are going into, um, the, uh the HMM.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And is are i i are are any deltas being computed of tha of them?\nphd c: Of the straight features, yeah.\nprofessor b: n Not of the \nphd c: So. But n th the, um, tandem features are u used as they are.\nprofessor b: Are not.\nphd c: So, yeah, maybe we can add some context from these features also as Dan did in in his last work.\nprofessor b: Could. i Yeah, but the other thing I was thinking was, um Uh, now I lost track of what I was thinking. But.\nphd a: What is the You said there was a limit of sixty features or something?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: What's the relation between that limit and the, um, forty - eight uh, forty eight hundred bits per second?\nprofessor b: Oh, I know what I was gonna say.\nphd c: Um, not no relation.\nprofessor b: No relation.\nphd a: So I I I don't understand,\nphd c: The f the forty - eight hundred bits is for transmission of some features.\nphd a: because i I mean, if you 're only using h\nphd c: And generally, i it s allows you to transmit like, fifteen, uh, cepstrum.\nprofessor b: The issue was that, um, this is supposed to be a standard that's then gonna be fed to somebody's recognizer somewhere which might be, you know, it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth. And so, uh, they felt they wanted to set a limit. So they chose sixty. Some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters and and that bothered some other people.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: u And so they just chose that. I I I think it's kind of r arbitrary too. But but that's that's kind of what was chosen. I I remembered what I was going to say. What I was going to say is that, um, maybe maybe with the noise removal, uh, these things are now more correlated. So you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated, uh, within themselves, but they 're pretty correlated with one another.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And, um, they 're being fed into these, uh, variants, only Gaussians and so forth, and and, uh,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to, uh, have, uh, one KLT over everything, to de - correlate it.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yeah, I see.\nprofessor b: Maybe. You know.\nphd d: What are the S N Rs in the training set, TIMIT?\nphd c: It's, uh, ranging from zero to clean? Yeah. From zero to clean.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So we found this this, uh this Macrophone data, and so forth, that we were using for these other experiments, to be pretty good.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So that's i after you explore these other alternatives, that might be another way to start looking, is is just improving the training set.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean, we were getting, uh, lots better recognition using that, than Of course, you do have the problem that, um, u i we are not able to increase the number of Gaussians, uh, or anything to, uh, uh, to match anything. So we 're only improving the training of our feature set, but that's still probably something.\nphd a: So you 're saying, add the Macrophone data to the training of the neural net? The tandem net?\nprofessor b: Yeah, that's the only place that we can train.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: We can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount,\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: so. Um, um \nphd a: What what was it trained on again? The one that you used?\nphd c: It's TIMIT with noise.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: So, yeah, it's rather a small \nprofessor b: How big is the net, by the way?\nphd c: Um, Uh, it's, uh, five hundred hidden units. And \nprofessor b: And again, you did experiments back then where you made it bigger and it and that was that was sort of the threshold point. Much less than that, it was worse,\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: much more than that, it wasn't much better. Hmm.\nphd c: Yeah. @ @?\nphd d: So is it is it though the performance, big relation in the high ma high mismatch has something to do with the, uh, cleaning up that you that is done on the TIMIT after adding noise?\nphd c: \nphd d: So it's i All the noises are from the TI - digits,\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: right? So you i\nphd c: Um They k uh \nphd d: Well, it it's like the high mismatch of the SpeechDat - Car after cleaning up, maybe having more noise than the the training set of TIMIT after clean s after you do the noise clean - up.\nphd c: Mmm.\nphd d: I mean, earlier you never had any compensation, you just trained it straight away.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: So it had like all these different conditions of S N Rs, actually in their training set of neural net.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd d: But after cleaning up you have now a different set of S N Rs, right?\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: For the training of the neural net.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And is it something to do with the mismatch that that's created after the cleaning up, like the high mismatch \nphd c: You mean the the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than \nphd d: Mm - hmm. Of that I mean, the SNR after the noise compensation of the SpeechDat - Car.\nprofessor b: Oh, so Right. So the training the the neural net is being trained with noise compensated stuff.\nphd c: Maybe.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor b: Which makes sense,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: but, uh, you 're saying Yeah, the noisier ones are still going to be, even after our noise compensation, are still gonna be pretty noisy.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Yeah, so now the after - noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of S N Rs than that was originally there in the training set. Of TIMIT. Because in the TIMIT it was zero to some clean.\nprofessor b: Right. Yes.\nphd d: So the net saw all the SNR @ @ conditions.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: Now after cleaning up it's a different set of SNR.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: And that SNR may not be, like, com covering the whole set of S N Rs that you 're getting in the SpeechDat - Car.\nprofessor b: Right, but the SpeechDat - Car data that you 're seeing is also reduced in noise by the noise compensation.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. But, I 'm saying, there could be some some issues of \nprofessor b: So.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Well, if the initial range of SNR is different, we the problem was already there before. And \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Because Mmm \nprofessor b: Yeah, I mean, it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set.\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh \nphd d: On the test set, yeah. \nprofessor b: Right? I mean, you 're saying there's a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before,\nphd d: Hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but if they were both the same before, then if they were both reduic reduced equally, then, there would not be a mismatch.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So, I mean, this may be Heaven forbid, this noise compensation process may be imperfect, but. Uh, so maybe it's treating some things differently.\nphd c: Yeah, uh \nphd d: Well, I I don't know. I I just that could be seen from the TI - digits, uh, testing condition because, um, the noises are from the TI - digits, right? Noise \nphd c: Yeah. So \nphd d: So cleaning up the TI - digits and if the performance goes down in the TI - digits mismatch high mismatch like this \nphd c: Clean training, yeah.\nphd d: on a clean training, or zero DB testing.\nphd c: Yeah, we 'll so we 'll see. Uh.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: Maybe.\nphd d: Then it's something to do.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean, one of the things about \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean, the Macrophone data, um, I think, you know, it was recorded over many different telephones.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And, um, so, there's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions. I mean, it's not artificially added noise or anything. So it's not the same. I don't think there's anybody recording over a car from a car, but I think it's it's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments, uh, and playing around with it doesn't, uh, make it better, the most uh, it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set. Um I mean, what we were uh the condition It it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with Meeting Recorder digits, even though there, again, these m Macrophone digits were very, very different from, uh, what we were going on here. I mean, we weren't talking over a telephone here. But it was just I think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yep.\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd c: Yeah, actually to s eh, what I observed in the HM case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases. It it doubles.\nprofessor b: Number of deletions.\nphd c: When I added the num the neural network it doubles the number of deletions. Yeah, so I don't you know how to interpret that, but, mmm \nprofessor b: Yeah. Me either.\nphd c: t\nphd a: And and did an other numbers stay the same? Insertion substitutions stay the same?\nphd c: They p stayed the same,\nphd a: Roughly?\nphd c: they maybe they are a little bit uh, lower.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: They are a little bit better. Yeah. But \nprofessor b: Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Say, for the I mean, it \nphd c: No, it doesn't.\nprofessor b: So it's only the highly mismatched?\nphd c: No.\nprofessor b: And it Remind me again, the \" highly mismatched \" means that the \nphd c: Clean training and \nprofessor b: Uh, sorry?\nphd c: It's clean training Well, close microphone training and distant microphone, um, high speed, I think.\nprofessor b: Close mike training \nphd c: Well The most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing.\nprofessor b: Right. So Well, maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech.\nphd c: Separating. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Wh\nphd c: But Yeah. I mean, but without the neural network it's well, it's better. It's just when we add the neural networks.\nprofessor b: Yeah, right.\nphd c: The feature are the same except that \nprofessor b: Uh, that's right, that's right. Um \nphd a: Well that that says that, you know, the, um the models in in, uh, the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But, yeah, actually  the TIMIT noises are sort of a range of noises and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises, right? It's it's pretty different. Isn't it?\nphd c: Uh, there is a car noise. So there are f just four noises. Um, uh, \" Car \", I think, \" Babble \",\nphd d: \" Babble. \"\nphd c: \" Subway \", right? and \nphd d: \" Street \" or \" Airport \" or something.\nphd c: and \" Street \" isn't \nphd d: Or \" Train station \".\nphd c: \" Train station \", yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: So it's mostly Well, \" Car \" is stationary,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: \" Babble \", it's a stationary background plus some voices,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: some speech over it. And the other two are rather stationary also.\nprofessor b: Well, I I think that if you run it Actually, you maybe you remember this. When you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only, and didn't have this side path, um, uh, with the the pure features as well, did it make things better to have the neural net?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Was it about the same? Uh, w i\nphd c: It was b a little bit worse.\nprofessor b: Than?\nphd c: Than just the features, yeah.\nprofessor b: So, until you put the second path in with the pure features, the neural net wasn't helping at all.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Well, that's interesting.\nphd c: It was helping, uh, if the features are b were bad,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: I mean. Just plain P L Ps or M F\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: C Cs. as soon as we added LDA on - line normalization, and all these things, then \nprofessor b: They were doing similar enough things. Well, I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing.\nphd c: Yeah,\nprofessor b: And and the thing I I have in mind is, uh, maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse.\nphd c: mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Maybe that they 're a lot worse. You know? And, um But if on the ha other hand, uh, it's, say, somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and, uh, what you 'd have with just the pure features, then maybe there is some problem of a of a, uh, combination of these things, or correlation between them somehow.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment, then I think the issue is to focus on on, uh, improving the the net.\nphd c: Yeah,\nprofessor b: Um.\nphd c: mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So what's the overall effe I mean, you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better, say, five percent better, for the first two conditions, and fifteen percent worse for the other one? But it's but of course that one's weighted lower,\nphd c: Y yeah, oh. Yeah.\nprofessor b: so I wonder what the net effect is.\nphd c: I d I I think it's it was one or two percent. That's not that bad, but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car. I have to to check that. Well, I have I will.\nphd d: Well, it will overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse, because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five point two five eight.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Hmm.\nprofessor b: Right. So the so the worst it could be, if the others were exactly the same, is four,\nphd d: Is it like \nprofessor b: and and, uh, in fact since the others are somewhat better \nphd d: Yeah, so it's four. Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out, or you 'll get, like, almost the same.\nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd c: Yeah, it was it was slightly worse.\nphd d: Slightly bad. Yeah.\nphd c: Um,\nprofessor b: Yeah, it should be pretty close to cancelled out.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: You know, I 've been wondering about something.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: In the, um a lot of the, um the Hub - five systems, um, recently have been using LDA. and and they, um They run LDA on the features right before they train the models. So there's the the LDA is is right there before the H M\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: So, you guys are using LDA but it seems like it's pretty far back in the process.\nphd d: Uh, this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about. The LDA that you saying is, like, you take a block of features, like nine frames or something, and then do an LDA on it,\nphd a: Yeah. Uh - huh.\nphd d: and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that.\nphd a: Yeah, you c you c you can.\nphd d: And then feed it to HMM.\nphd a: I mean, it's you know, you 're just basically i\nphd d: Yeah, so this is like a two d two dimensional tile.\nphd a: You 're shifting the feature space. Yeah.\nphd d: So this is a two dimensional tile. And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time, not in frequency high cost frequency. So it's like more like a filtering in time, rather than doing a r\nphd a: Ah. OK. So what i what about, um i u what i w I mean, I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but what if you put ran the other kind of LDA, uh, on your features right before they go into the HMM?\nphd d: Uh, it \nphd c: Mm - hmm. No, actually, I think i\nphd d: m\nphd c: Well. What do we do with the ANN is is something like that except that it's not linear. But it's it's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis.\nphd a: Yeah. Right, it's the It's Right. The So Yeah, so it's sort of like \nphd c: But.\nphd a: The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA.\nphd c: Yeah. It's \nphd a: I g\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: But I mean, w but the other features that you have, um, th the non - tandem ones,\nphd c: Uh. Mm - hmm. Yeah, I know. That that Yeah. Well, in the proposal, they were transformed u using PCA, but \nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: Yeah, it might be that LDA could be better.\nprofessor b: The a the argument i is kind of i in and it's not like we really know, but the argument anyway is that, um, uh, we always have the prob I mean, discriminative things are good. LDA, neural nets, they 're good.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh, they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between. And PCA doesn't do that. It PAC - PCA low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh, maybe not not gonna be helpful just because they 're small, basically.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: But, uh, the problem is, training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different. So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff, be it LDA or neural nets, that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: And so, uh, Stephane's idea was, uh, let's feed, uh, both this discriminatively trained thing and something that's not. So you have a good set of features that everybody's worked really hard to make,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and then, uh, you you discriminately train it, but you also take the path that that doesn't have that,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: and putting those in together. And that that seem So it's kind of like a combination of the uh, what, uh, Dan has been calling, you know, a feature uh, you know, a feature combination versus posterior combination or something. It's it's, you know, you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things. And that seemed, at least in the last one, as he was just saying, he he when he only did discriminative stuff, i it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: There was enough of a difference, I guess, between the testing and training. But by having them both there The fact is some of the time, the discriminative stuff is gonna help you.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And some of the time it's going to hurt you,\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: and by combining two information sources if, you know if if \nphd a: So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that \nprofessor b: That i i I think that's counter to that idea.\nphd a: Yeah, right.\nprofessor b: Now, again, it's we 're just trying these different things. We don't really know what's gonna work best. But if that's the hypothesis, at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: Um, and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA.\nphd a: Right. Yeah. Well y\nprofessor b: Though, maybe not.\nphd a: Yeah. Exactly. I mean, we, uh we were getting ready to do the tandem, uh, stuff for the Hub - five system, and, um, Andreas and I talked about it, and the idea w the thought was, \" Well, uh, yeah, that i you know th the neural net should be better, but we should at least have uh, a number, you know, to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net, so that we can you know, show a clear path.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd a: You know, that you have it without it, then you have the LDA, then you have the neural net, and you can see, theoretically. So. I was just wondering I I \nprofessor b: Well, I think that's a good idea.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Did did you do that\nphd a: Um. No.\nprofessor b: or tha that's a \nphd a: That's what that's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing. So.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. No, well, that's a good idea. I I \nphd a: We just want to show.\nprofessor b: i Yeah.\nphd a: I mean, it everybody believes it,\nprofessor b: Oh, no it's a g\nphd a: but you know, we just \nprofessor b: No, no, but it might not not even be true.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean, it's it's it's it's it's a great idea. I mean, one of the things that always disturbed me, uh, in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that, um, a lot of people Because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without, uh, looking at all into the linear, uh uh, versions of them.\nphd a: Yeah. Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor b: And, uh, people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters, and You know, I mean, uh, so I think, yeah, it's definitely a good idea to try it.\nphd a: Yeah, and everybody's putting that on their systems now, and so, I that's what made me wonder about this,\nprofessor b: Well, they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years,\nphd a: but.\nprofessor b: but but but, uh,\nphd a: Yeah, what I mean is it's it's like in the Hub - five evaluations, you know, and you read the system descriptions and everybody's got, you know, LDA on their features.\nprofessor b: And now they all have that. I see.\nphd a: And so.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh.\nphd c: It's the transformation they 're estimating on Well, they are trained on the same data as the final HMM are.\nphd a: Yeah, so it's different. Yeah, exactly. Cuz they don't have these, you know, mismatches that that you guys have.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So that's why I was wondering if maybe it's not even a good idea.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I don't know. I I don't know enough about it,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: but Um.\nprofessor b: I mean, part of why I I think part of why you were getting into the KLT Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if, uh, you know, getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing, right? So you were just trying I think you r I mean, this is it doesn't have the LDA aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation, you were trying that at one point, right?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I think you were.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Does something. It doesn't work as well. Yeah. Yeah.\nphd d: So, yeah, I 've been exploring a parallel VAD without neural network with, like, less latency using SNR and energy, um, after the cleaning up. So what I 'd been trying was, um, uh After the b after the noise compensation, n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies, that is, cl after clean and before clean. So that if if they are, like, pretty c close to one, which means it's speech. And if it is n if it is close to zero, which is So it's like a scale @ @ probability value. So I was trying, uh, with full band and multiple bands, m ps uh separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands, and trying to combine them. Uh, the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: g And it gave me like, uh, one point One more than one percent relative improvement. So, from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight. So it's, like, only slightly more than a percent improvement,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: just like Which means that it's it's doing a slightly better job than the previous VAD,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: uh, at a l lower delay.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Um, so, um \nprofessor b: But i d I 'm sorry,\nphd d: so u\nprofessor b: does it still have the median filter stuff?\nphd d: It still has the median filter.\nprofessor b: So it still has most of the delay,\nphd d: So \nprofessor b: it just doesn't \nphd d: Yeah, so d with the delay, that's gone is the input, which is the sixty millisecond. The forty plus twenty.\nprofessor b: Well, w i\nphd d: At the input of the neural net you have this, uh, f nine frames of context plus the delta.\nprofessor b: Oh, plus the delta,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: right. OK.\nphd d: Yeah. So that delay, plus the LDA.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Uh, so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning, plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Um. So. Yeah. So the the di the biggest The problem f for me was to find a consistent threshold that works well across the different databases, because I t I try to make it work on tr SpeechDat - Car\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: and it fails on TI - digits, or if I try to make it work on that it's just the Italian or something, it doesn't work on the Finnish.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: So, um. So there are there was, like, some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when I try different thresholds.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: So The I 'm still trying to make it better by using some other features from the after the p clean up maybe, some, uh, correlation auto - correlation or some s additional features of to mainly the improvement of the VAD. I 've been trying.\nprofessor b: Now this this this, uh, \" before and after clean \", it sounds like you think that's a good feature. That that, it you th think that the, uh the i it appears to be a good feature, right?\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: What about using it in the neural net?\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah, eventually we could could just\nphd d: Yeah, so Yeah, so that's the Yeah. So we 've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Because they did that itself \nphd c: Then you don't have to worry about the thresholds and \nphd d: There's a threshold and Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: but just \nphd d: Yeah. So that that's, uh \nprofessor b: Yeah. So if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere, then then that would be a, uh, good thing.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Um, anybody has anybody you guys or or Naren, uh, somebody, tried the, uh, um, second th second stream thing? Uh.\nphd d: Oh, I just I just h put the second stream in place and, uh ran one experiment, but just like just to know that everything is fine.\nprofessor b: Uh - huh.\nphd d: So it was like, uh, forty - five cepstrum plus twenty - three mel log mel.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: And and, just, like, it gave me the baseline performance of the Aurora, which is like zero improvement.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd d: So I just tried it on Italian just to know that everything is But I I didn't export anything out of it because it was, like, a weird feature set.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: So.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well, what I think, you know, would be more what you 'd want to do is is is, uh, put it into another neural net. Right?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor b: And then But, yeah, we 're we 're not quite there yet. So we have to figure out the neural nets, I guess.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: The uh, other thing I was wondering was, um, if the neural net, um, has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net, where, like, you train it on those four noise conditions, while you are feeding it with, like, a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it hasn't seen, actually,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: from the f f while testing.\nphd c: Yeah, yeah. Right.\nphd d: Um instead of just h having c uh, those cleaned up t cepstrum, sh should we feed some additional information, like The the We have the VAD flag. I mean, should we f feed the VAD flag, also, at the input so that it it has some additional discriminating information at the input?\nphd c: Hmm - hmm! Um \nprofessor b: Wh - uh, the the VAD what?\nphd d: We have the VAD information also available at the back - end.\nprofessor b: Uh - huh.\nphd d: So if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the classes \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: I mean Because most of it is sil I mean, we have dropped some silence f We have dropped so silence frames?\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: No, we haven't dropped silence frames still.\nphd c: Uh, still not. Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah. So \nphd c: Th\nphd d: the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence. So, by having an additional, uh, feature which says \" this is speech and this is nonspeech \", I mean, it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net.\nphd a: What Do y do you have that feature available for the test data?\nphd d: Well, I mean, we have we are transferring the VAD to the back - end feature to the back - end. Because we are dropping it at the back - end after everything all the features are computed.\nphd a: Oh, oh, I see.\nphd d: So \nphd a: I see.\nphd d: so the neural so that is coming from a separate neural net or some VAD.\nphd a: OK. OK.\nphd d: Which is which is certainly giving a\nphd a: So you 're saying, feed that, also, into the neural net.\nphd d: to Yeah. So it it's an additional discriminating information.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah. Right.\nphd d: So that \nprofessor b: You could feed it into the neural net. The other thing you could do is just, um, p modify the, uh, output probabilities of the of the, uh, uh, um, neural net, tandem neural net, based on the fact that you have a silence probability.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Right?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is, and you could multiply the two things, and renormalize.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh, I mean, you 'd have to do the nonlinearity part and deal with that. Uh, I mean, go backwards from what the nonlinearity would, you know would be.\nphd d: Through t to the soft max.\nprofessor b: But but, uh \nphd c: Yeah, so maybe, yeah, when \nphd a: But in principle wouldn't it be better to feed it in? And let the net do that?\nprofessor b: Well, u Not sure.\nphd a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean, let's put it this way. I mean, y you you have this complicated system with thousands and thousand parameters\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and you can tell it, uh, \" Learn this thing. \" Or you can say, \" It's silence! Go away! \" I mean, I mean, i Doesn't? I think I think the second one sounds a lot more direct.\nphd a: What what if you \nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd a: Right. So, what if you then, uh since you know this, what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions?\nprofessor b: Well, uh,\nphd c: That's what \nphd a: Well, I guess that's the same. Uh, that's similar.\nprofessor b: Yeah, I mean, y you 'd have to actually run it continuously,\nphd a: But I mean I mean, train the net only on \nprofessor b: but it's @ @ Well, no, you want to train on on the nonspeech also, because that's part of what you 're learning in it, to to to generate, that it's it has to distinguish between.\nphd d: Speech.\nphd a: But I mean, if you 're gonna if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision, uh, would then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction, right?\nprofessor b: Well, yeah. But this other thing isn't perfect.\nphd a: Ah.\nprofessor b: So that you bring in some information from the net itself.\nphd a: Right, OK. That's a good point.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that I I I The the fact i i It's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions.\nphd c: Yeah. But So I might maybe look at, is it due to the fact that um, the probability of the silence at the output of the network, is, uh,\nprofessor b: Is too high.\nphd c: too too high or \nprofessor b: Yeah. So maybe So \nphd c: If it's the case, then multiplying it again by i by something?\nphd d: It may not be it \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Yeah, it it may be too it's too high in a sense, like, everything is more like a, um, flat probability.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Oh - eee - hhh.\nphd d: So, like, it's not really doing any distinction between speech and nonspeech \nphd c: Uh, yeah.\nphd d: or, I mean, different among classes.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Be interesting to look at the Yeah, for the I wonder if you could do this. But if you look at the, um, highly mism high mismat the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at, you know, the distribution versus the the other ones, do you do you see more peaks or something?\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah, like the entropy of the the output,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah, for instance.\nphd c: or \nprofessor b: But I bu\nphd c: It it seems that the VAD network doesn't Well, it doesn't drop, uh, too many frames because the dele the number of deletion is reasonable. But it's just when we add the tandem, the final MLP, and then \nprofessor b: Yeah. Now the only problem is you don't want to ta I guess wait for the output of the VAD before you can put something into the other system,\nphd c: u\nprofessor b: cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot, right? Am I missing something here?\nphd c: But \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Yeah. Right.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So that's maybe a problem with what I was just saying. But but I I guess \nphd a: But if you were gonna put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net, right?\nphd d: Um, well. We w we don't have it, actually,\nprofessor b: No.\nphd d: because it's it has a high rate energy \nphd a: Ah.\nphd d: the VAD has a \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor b: It's kind of done in I mean, some of the things are, not in parallel, but certainly, it would be in parallel with the with a tandem net.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: In time. So maybe, if that doesn't work, um But it would be interesting to see if that was the problem, anyway. And and and then I guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you 're feeding into the VAD, and feeding it into the other one as well.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And then maybe it would just learn learn it better.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Um But that's Yeah, that's an interesting thing to try to see, if what's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition, it's, um, causing deletions by having this silence probability up up too high,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: at some point where the VAD is saying it's actually speech.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Which is probably true.\nphd c: So, m\nprofessor b: Cuz Well, the V A if the VAD said since the VAD is is is right a lot, uh \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Hmm. Anyway. Might be.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well, we just started working with it. But these are these are some good ideas I think.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yeah, and the other thing Well, there are other issues maybe for the tandem, like, uh, well, do we want to, w uh n Do we want to work on the targets? Or, like, instead of using phonemes, using more context dependent units?\nphd a: For the tandem net you mean?\nphd c: Well, I 'm Yeah.\nphd a: Hmm.\nphd c: I 'm thinking, also, a w about Dan's work where he he trained a network, not on phoneme targets but on the HMM state targets. And it was giving s slightly better results.\nprofessor b: Problem is, if you are going to run this on different m test sets, including large vocabulary,\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor b: um,\nphd c: Uh \nprofessor b: I think \nphd c: Mmm. I was just thinking maybe about, like, generalized diphones, and come up with a a reasonable, not too large, set of context dependent units, and and Yeah. And then anyway we would have to reduce this with the KLT.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: So. But I don't know.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well, maybe. But I d I d it it i it's all worth looking at,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but it sounds to me like, uh, looking at the relationship between this and the speech noise stuff is is is probably a key thing.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: That and the correlation between stuff.\nphd a: So if, uh if the, uh, high mismatch case had been more like the, uh, the other two cases in terms of giving you just a better performance, how would this number have changed?\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Oh, it would be Yeah. Around five percent better, I guess. If if i\nphd a: y Like sixty?\nprofessor b: Well, we don't know what's it's gonna be the TI - digits yet. He hasn't got the results back yet.\nphd c: Yeah. If you extrapolate the SpeechDat - Car well - matched and medium - mismatch, it's around, yeah, maybe five.\nphd a: Uh - huh. Yeah. So this would be sixty - two?\nprofessor b: Sixty - two.\nphd a: Which is \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Sixty - two, yeah.\nphd d: Somewhere around sixty, must be. Right? Yeah.\nphd c: Well, it's around five percent, because it's s Right? If everything is five percent.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: All the other ones were five percent,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: the \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: I d I d I just have the SpeechDat - Car right now, so \nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: It's running it shou we should have the results today during the afternoon,\nphd a: Hmm.\nphd c: but Well.\nprofessor b: Hmm. Well Um So I won't be here for \nphd a: When When do you leave?\nprofessor b: Uh, I 'm leaving next Wednesday. May or may not be in in the morning. I leave in the afternoon. Um,\nphd a: But you 're \nprofessor b: so I \nphd a: are you you 're not gonna be around this afternoon?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: Oh.\nprofessor b: Oh, well. I 'm talking about next week. I 'm leaving leaving next Wednesday.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: This afternoon uh Oh, right, for the Meeting meeting? Yeah, that's just cuz of something on campus.\nphd a: Ah, OK, OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah. But, um, yeah, so next week I won't, and the week after I won't, cuz I 'll be in Finland. And the week after that I won't. By that time you 'll be  Uh, you 'll both be gone from here. So there 'll be no definitely no meeting on on September sixth. Uh,\nphd a: What's September sixth?\nprofessor b: and Uh, that's during Eurospeech.\nphd a: Oh, oh, right. OK.\nprofessor b: So, uh, Sunil will be in Oregon. Uh, Stephane and I will be in Denmark. Uh Right? So it 'll be a few weeks, really, before we have a meeting of the same cast of characters. Um, but, uh I guess, just I mean, you guys should probably meet. And maybe Barry Barry will be around. And and then uh, uh, we 'll start up again with Dave and Dave and Barry and Stephane and us on the, uh, twentieth. No. Thirteenth? About a month?\nphd a: So, uh, you 're gonna be gone for the next three weeks or something?\nprofessor b: I 'm gone for two and a half weeks starting starting next Wed - late next Wednesday.\nphd a: So that's you won't be at the next three of these meetings. Is that right?\nprofessor b: Uh, I won't it's probably four because of is it three? Let's see, twenty - third, thirtieth, sixth. That's right, next three. And the the third one won't probably won't be a meeting, cuz cuz, uh, Su - Sunil, Stephane, and I will all not be here.\nphd a: Oh, right. Right.\nprofessor b: Um Mmm. So it's just, uh, the next two where there will be there, you know, may as well be meetings,\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor b: but I just won't be at them. And then starting up on the thirteenth, uh, we 'll have meetings again but we 'll have to do without Sunil here somehow.\nphd a: When do you go back?\nprofessor b: So.\nphd d: Thirty - first, August.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. So. Cool.\nphd a: When is the evaluation? November, or something?\nprofessor b: Yeah, it was supposed to be November fifteenth. Has anybody heard anything different?\nphd c: I don't know. The meeting in is the five and six of December. So \nphd d: p s It's like Yeah, it's tentatively all full. Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Uh, that's a proposed date, I guess.\nphd c: Yeah, um so the evaluation should be on a week before or \nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yep. But, no, this is good progress.

{"fname": "academic_test_53", "dialogue": "phd c: Yeah, actually to s eh, what I observed in the HM case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases. It it doubles.\nprofessor b: Number of deletions.\nphd c: When I added the num the neural network it doubles the number of deletions. Yeah, so I don't you know how to interpret that, but, mmm \nprofessor b: Yeah. Me either.\nphd c: t\nphd a: And and did an other numbers stay the same? Insertion substitutions stay the same?\nphd c: They p stayed the same,\nphd a: Roughly?\nphd c: they maybe they are a little bit uh, lower.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: They are a little bit better. Yeah. But \nprofessor b: Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Say, for the I mean, it \nphd c: No, it doesn't.\nprofessor b: So it's only the highly mismatched?\nphd c: No.\nprofessor b: And it Remind me again, the \" highly mismatched \" means that the \nphd c: Clean training and \nprofessor b: Uh, sorry?\nphd c: It's clean training Well, close microphone training and distant microphone, um, high speed, I think.\nprofessor b: Close mike training \nphd c: Well The most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing.\nprofessor b: Right. So Well, maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech.\nphd c: Separating. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Wh\nphd c: But Yeah. I mean, but without the neural network it's well, it's better. It's just when we add the neural networks.\nprofessor b: Yeah, right.\nphd c: The feature are the same except that \nprofessor b: Uh, that's right, that's right. Um \nphd a: Well that that says that, you know, the, um the models in in, uh, the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But, yeah, actually  the TIMIT noises are sort of a range of noises and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises, right? It's it's pretty different. Isn't it?\nphd c: Uh, there is a car noise. So there are f just four noises. Um, uh, \" Car \", I think, \" Babble \",\nphd d: \" Babble. \"\nphd c: \" Subway \", right? and \nphd d: \" Street \" or \" Airport \" or something.\nphd c: and \" Street \" isn't \nphd d: Or \" Train station \".\nphd c: \" Train station \", yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: So it's mostly Well, \" Car \" is stationary,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: \" Babble \", it's a stationary background plus some voices,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: some speech over it. And the other two are rather stationary also.\nprofessor b: Well, I I think that if you run it Actually, you maybe you remember this. When you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only, and didn't have this side path, um, uh, with the the pure features as well, did it make things better to have the neural net?\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Was it about the same? Uh, w i\nphd c: It was b a little bit worse.\nprofessor b: Than?\nphd c: Than just the features, yeah.\nprofessor b: So, until you put the second path in with the pure features, the neural net wasn't helping at all.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Well, that's interesting.\nphd c: It was helping, uh, if the features are b were bad,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: I mean. Just plain P L Ps or M F\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: C Cs. as soon as we added LDA on - line normalization, and all these things, then \nprofessor b: They were doing similar enough things. Well, I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing.\nphd c: Yeah,\nprofessor b: And and the thing I I have in mind is, uh, maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse.\nphd c: mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Maybe that they 're a lot worse. You know? And, um But if on the ha other hand, uh, it's, say, somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and, uh, what you 'd have with just the pure features, then maybe there is some problem of a of a, uh, combination of these things, or correlation between them somehow.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment, then I think the issue is to focus on on, uh, improving the the net.\nphd c: Yeah,\nprofessor b: Um.\nphd c: mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So what's the overall effe I mean, you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better, say, five percent better, for the first two conditions, and fifteen percent worse for the other one? But it's but of course that one's weighted lower,\nphd c: Y yeah, oh. Yeah.\nprofessor b: so I wonder what the net effect is.\nphd c: I d I I think it's it was one or two percent. That's not that bad, but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car. I have to to check that. Well, I have I will.\nphd d: Well, it will overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse, because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five point two five eight.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Hmm.\nprofessor b: Right. So the so the worst it could be, if the others were exactly the same, is four,\nphd d: Is it like \nprofessor b: and and, uh, in fact since the others are somewhat better \nphd d: Yeah, so it's four. Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out, or you 'll get, like, almost the same.\nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd c: Yeah, it was it was slightly worse.\nphd d: Slightly bad. Yeah.\nphd c: Um,\nprofessor b: Yeah, it should be pretty close to cancelled out.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: You know, I 've been wondering about something.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: In the, um a lot of the, um the Hub - five systems, um, recently have been using LDA. and and they, um They run LDA on the features right before they train the models. So there's the the LDA is is right there before the H M\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: So, you guys are using LDA but it seems like it's pretty far back in the process.\nphd d: Uh, this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about. The LDA that you saying is, like, you take a block of features, like nine frames or something, and then do an LDA on it,\nphd a: Yeah. Uh - huh.\nphd d: and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that.\nphd a: Yeah, you c you c you can.\nphd d: And then feed it to HMM.\nphd a: I mean, it's you know, you 're just basically i\nphd d: Yeah, so this is like a two d two dimensional tile.\nphd a: You 're shifting the feature space. Yeah.\nphd d: So this is a two dimensional tile. And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time, not in frequency high cost frequency. So it's like more like a filtering in time, rather than doing a r\nphd a: Ah. OK. So what i what about, um i u what i w I mean, I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but what if you put ran the other kind of LDA, uh, on your features right before they go into the HMM?\nphd d: Uh, it \nphd c: Mm - hmm. No, actually, I think i\nphd d: m\nphd c: Well. What do we do with the ANN is is something like that except that it's not linear. But it's it's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis.\nphd a: Yeah. Right, it's the It's Right. The So Yeah, so it's sort of like \nphd c: But.\nphd a: The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA.\nphd c: Yeah. It's \nphd a: I g\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: But I mean, w but the other features that you have, um, th the non - tandem ones,\nphd c: Uh. Mm - hmm. Yeah, I know. That that Yeah. Well, in the proposal, they were transformed u using PCA, but \nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: Yeah, it might be that LDA could be better.\nprofessor b: The a the argument i is kind of i in and it's not like we really know, but the argument anyway is that, um, uh, we always have the prob I mean, discriminative things are good. LDA, neural nets, they 're good.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh, they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between. And PCA doesn't do that. It PAC - PCA low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh, maybe not not gonna be helpful just because they 're small, basically.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: But, uh, the problem is, training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different. So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff, be it LDA or neural nets, that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: And so, uh, Stephane's idea was, uh, let's feed, uh, both this discriminatively trained thing and something that's not. So you have a good set of features that everybody's worked really hard to make,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and then, uh, you you discriminately train it, but you also take the path that that doesn't have that,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: and putting those in together. And that that seem So it's kind of like a combination of the uh, what, uh, Dan has been calling, you know, a feature uh, you know, a feature combination versus posterior combination or something. It's it's, you know, you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things. And that seemed, at least in the last one, as he was just saying, he he when he only did discriminative stuff, i it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: There was enough of a difference, I guess, between the testing and training. But by having them both there The fact is some of the time, the discriminative stuff is gonna help you.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And some of the time it's going to hurt you,\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: and by combining two information sources if, you know if if \nphd a: So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that \nprofessor b: That i i I think that's counter to that idea.\nphd a: Yeah, right.\nprofessor b: Now, again, it's we 're just trying these different things. We don't really know what's gonna work best. But if that's the hypothesis, at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that.", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion on deletions and improving the net", "zh_query": "总结关于删除和改进网络的讨论", "fr_query": "Résumer la discussion sur les suppressions et l'amélioration du réseau", "ukr_query": "Підведіть підсумки дискусії щодо видалень та збільшення мережі", "en_summary": "Adding the neural net was doubling the number of deletions.

Well, I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing.\nphd c: Yeah,\nprofessor b: And and the thing I I have in mind is, uh, maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse.\nphd c: mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Maybe that they 're a lot worse. You know? And, um But if on the ha other hand, uh, it's, say, somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and, uh, what you 'd have with just the pure features, then maybe there is some problem of a of a, uh, combination of these things, or correlation between them somehow.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment, then I think the issue is to focus on on, uh, improving the the net.\nphd c: Yeah,\nprofessor b: Um.\nphd c: mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So what's the overall effe I mean, you haven't done all the experiments but you said it was i somewhat better, say, five percent better, for the first two conditions, and fifteen percent worse for the other one? But it's but of course that one's weighted lower,\nphd c: Y yeah, oh. Yeah.\nprofessor b: so I wonder what the net effect is.\nphd c: I d I I think it's it was one or two percent. That's not that bad, but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car. I have to to check that. Well, I have I will.\nphd d: Well, it will overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse, because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five point two five eight.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Hmm.\nprofessor b: Right. So the so the worst it could be, if the others were exactly the same, is four,\nphd d: Is it like \nprofessor b: and and, uh, in fact since the others are somewhat better \nphd d: Yeah, so it's four. Is i So either it 'll get cancelled out, or you 'll get, like, almost the same.\nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd c: Yeah, it was it was slightly worse.\nphd d: Slightly bad. Yeah.\nphd c: Um,\nprofessor b: Yeah, it should be pretty close to cancelled out.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: You know, I 've been wondering about something.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: In the, um a lot of the, um the Hub - five systems, um, recently have been using LDA. and and they, um They run LDA on the features right before they train the models. So there's the the LDA is is right there before the H M\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: So, you guys are using LDA but it seems like it's pretty far back in the process.\nphd d: Uh, this LDA is different from the LDA that you are talking about. The LDA that you saying is, like, you take a block of features, like nine frames or something, and then do an LDA on it,\nphd a: Yeah. Uh - huh.\nphd d: and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty - four or something like that.\nphd a: Yeah, you c you c you can.\nphd d: And then feed it to HMM.\nphd a: I mean, it's you know, you 're just basically i\nphd d: Yeah, so this is like a two d two dimensional tile.\nphd a: You 're shifting the feature space. Yeah.\nphd d: So this is a two dimensional tile. And the LDA that we are f applying is only in time, not in frequency high cost frequency. So it's like more like a filtering in time, rather than doing a r\nphd a: Ah. OK. So what i what about, um i u what i w I mean, I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but what if you put ran the other kind of LDA, uh, on your features right before they go into the HMM?\nphd d: Uh, it \nphd c: Mm - hmm. No, actually, I think i\nphd d: m\nphd c: Well. What do we do with the ANN is is something like that except that it's not linear. But it's it's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis.\nphd a: Yeah. Right, it's the It's Right. The So Yeah, so it's sort of like \nphd c: But.\nphd a: The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA.\nphd c: Yeah. It's \nphd a: I g\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: But I mean, w but the other features that you have, um, th the non - tandem ones,\nphd c: Uh. Mm - hmm. Yeah, I know. That that Yeah. Well, in the proposal, they were transformed u using PCA, but \nphd a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: Yeah, it might be that LDA could be better.\nprofessor b: The a the argument i is kind of i in and it's not like we really know, but the argument anyway is that, um, uh, we always have the prob I mean, discriminative things are good. LDA, neural nets, they 're good.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh, they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between. And PCA doesn't do that. It PAC - PCA low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh, maybe not not gonna be helpful just because they 're small, basically.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: But, uh, the problem is, training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different. So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff, be it LDA or neural nets, that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: And so, uh, Stephane's idea was, uh, let's feed, uh, both this discriminatively trained thing and something that's not. So you have a good set of features that everybody's worked really hard to make,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and then, uh, you you discriminately train it, but you also take the path that that doesn't have that,\nphd a: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: and putting those in together. And that that seem So it's kind of like a combination of the uh, what, uh, Dan has been calling, you know, a feature uh, you know, a feature combination versus posterior combination or something. It's it's, you know, you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things. And that seemed, at least in the last one, as he was just saying, he he when he only did discriminative stuff, i it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: There was enough of a difference, I guess, between the testing and training. But by having them both there The fact is some of the time, the discriminative stuff is gonna help you.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And some of the time it's going to hurt you,\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: and by combining two information sources if, you know if if \nphd a: So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that \nprofessor b: That i i I think that's counter to that idea.\nphd a: Yeah, right.\nprofessor b: Now, again, it's we 're just trying these different things. We don't really know what's gonna work best. But if that's the hypothesis, at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor b: Um, and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA.\nphd a: Right. Yeah. Well y\nprofessor b: Though, maybe not.\nphd a: Yeah. Exactly. I mean, we, uh we were getting ready to do the tandem, uh, stuff for the Hub - five system, and, um, Andreas and I talked about it, and the idea w the thought was, \" Well, uh, yeah, that i you know th the neural net should be better, but we should at least have uh, a number, you know, to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net, so that we can you know, show a clear path.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd a: You know, that you have it without it, then you have the LDA, then you have the neural net, and you can see, theoretically. So. I was just wondering I I \nprofessor b: Well, I think that's a good idea.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Did did you do that\nphd a: Um. No.\nprofessor b: or tha that's a \nphd a: That's what that's what we 're gonna do next as soon as I finish this other thing. So.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. No, well, that's a good idea. I I \nphd a: We just want to show.\nprofessor b: i Yeah.\nphd a: I mean, it everybody believes it,\nprofessor b: Oh, no it's a g\nphd a: but you know, we just \nprofessor b: No, no, but it might not not even be true.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean, it's it's it's it's it's a great idea. I mean, one of the things that always disturbed me, uh, in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that, um, a lot of people Because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without, uh, looking at all into the linear, uh uh, versions of them.\nphd a: Yeah.

Um, and then it's a pretty small neural network which use, um, nine frames of of six features from C - zero to C - fives, plus the first derivatives. And it has one hundred hidden units.\nphd a: Is that nine frames u s uh, centered around the current frame? Or \nphd c: Yeah.

And, uh, the VAD is used uh, i for on - line normalization, and it's used before the delta computation.

So this is our kick off meeting. Um and I guess we should all get acquainted. Let's shall we all introduce ourselves?\nmarketing: Hi I'm Chiara, I'm the um Marketing Expert. Um, would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment, or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later?\nproject manager: I think we'll get around to that, yeah. So this is just introductions yeah.\nmarketing: We'll get round to that later. My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert.\nproject manager: Okay. I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: um so.\nuser interface: I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer.\nindustrial designer: I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer.\nproject manager: Okay. Um so f here's our agenda for today. Um we're gonna do some tool training, project plan and discuss then close. Um so. So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original, trendy and user friendly. And to do this, we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing. So. We'll get to that. Oh there it is. Right. Functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things. Um so we're gonna try out our white board. If we'll all draw our favourite animal, to sum up the characteristics of that animal. Okay.\nuser interface: So you want us to draw it and then talk about it? Or just draw it?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think both. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Both. Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. Why don't we do both. Right.\nmarketing: Who starts? We ought to decide who starts and all that. No?\nproject manager: Any volunteers?\nmarketing: Uh-huh.\nproject manager: Does anyone know what they wanna draw? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm, I gotta think about it for a second like. Uh Does it have to be functional, trendy and user friendly? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um. Okay, I'll draw. I'll draw one.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Make sure my things here. Uh-oh. Right. Okay, my favourite animal is see. Oops.\nproject manager: A dolphin.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'S like playing Pictionary.\nuser interface: Yeah, I guess it has a fin on top too, yeah. It's my dolphin.\nproject manager: So what characteristics do you like about your animal? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I like its tail.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, no, I think dolphins are really uh I dunno, they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool, like \nproject manager: They're graceful.\nuser interface: they're graceful yeah, and they're so \nproject manager: Sleek.\nuser interface: Yeah they're sleek\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and they look intelligent and I don't know, they're I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing.\nproject manager: I don't know how intelligent that one looks.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah he he doesn't look that smart. He's a I dunno um they're I think it's cool the the um the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals, but they swim. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. Does anybody else wanna draw their animal?\nindustrial designer: Suppose I can draw an animal, yeah.\nproject manager:.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-oh there goes the ten.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's a cat. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't know. They sleep all day, they're easy to draw.\nproject manager: Do you wanna anything?\nmarketing: Uh yeah.\nproject manager: I dunno if the the \nindustrial designer: I think the pen is running out of \nmarketing: Well I had the cat as well, but uh I've got a spare one.\nproject manager: ah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So I'll use the spare one. Um but it's harder to draw um.\nuser interface: And the pen's dying.\nmarketing: Um.\nproject manager: A horse.\nuser interface: Horse.\nmarketing: Uh. Um I don't really know how the legs go,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's very good.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but anyway I will do that. Um, and the main reason is they're pretty. I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment, and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals. And I like the way um they feel, sort of under under the hand, I think that's pretty much it. Um \nproject manager: Yeah. This cord's  Uh. Right. Actually I haven't thought of anything yet. Uh It's a pig.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. What do you think, yeah? This is \nuser interface: And furry.\nproject manager: yeah, well like a cat, you know, soft yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Textile tactile, tactile remote control.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Although uh I'll just put there. Right.\nuser interface: You're dragging a you have a tail.\nproject manager: Oh my gosh, this is disastrous. Sorry about that. Okay. So moving on. Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro. So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland, we're in some European country. Um, and we will hope to sell this internationally.\nuser interface: Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again?\nproject manager: Um selling price is twenty five Euro. Profit aim fifty million Euro.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: How many should we sell then? Um, a lot,\nproject manager: Anyone a mathematician? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: two two two million, two mi no, more f four million.\nindustrial designer: Two million.\nmarketing: Four million. And it \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty, that'll do four million.\nindustrial designer: Oh, yeah.\nmarketing: It is a lot. Uh.\nproject manager: So f that's a fifty percent um uh. Um, I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show. Experience with remote control. So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient, practical, nice remote control. Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have.\nmarketing: Um, I think one thing is that it should be easy to find\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I was thinking that too.\nmarketing: bec yeah bec\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your T_V_ is, so just have a call button,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I've always wanted that,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: so like you can push a button on your T_V_ \nmarketing: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: I mean you have it for the portable phone, so why not yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control.\nmarketing: Yeah. And even I think a little light. Um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't know if it's expensive maybe to \nuser interface: I don't yeah I mean it but like I mean \nmarketing: Maybe call is enough. But yeah.\nuser interface: just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate, it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base. You know like a portable phone has a base,\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah, or if it had a yeah.\nproject manager: like just to have a home for it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nproject manager: 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_, but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_, so \nuser interface: I mean \nindustrial designer: Well that's why it's always in the couch.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, in in the couch.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: \nuser interface: I dunno, it seems like though that that would be hard, 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and \nproject manager: Yeah. Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls.\nmarketing: But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing, a pretty object attached to the wall. But that would really make it more expensive.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But it's only a plastic thing, r really, the thing on the wall.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Something like that.\nproject manager: Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or does that not factor in?\nmarketing: And the other thing is \nuser interface: Bigger.\nmarketing: Not well it needs to be sort of \nproject manager: Like Hand hand held size, yeah.\nuser interface: Hand-sized.\nmarketing: Yeah. I don't think you need a \nproject manager: Not not huge, but {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But definitely not well I don't know.\nuser interface: It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it.\nmarketing: No, it can't be, uh-uh.\nindustrial designer: No it really wouldn't be.\nproject manager: Huh.\nuser interface: Or like or like a light thing. You know. I dunno {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Like spaceship.\nuser interface:. Yeah. Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That would be really I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop.\nproject manager: Little homing device. Um.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh.\nproject manager: Okay. So what do we think this remote control should Five minutes.\nmarketing: Oh dear.\nproject manager: Till the meeting oh right. This is what we have left. Um, oh we just \nuser interface: I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I agree.\nuser interface: 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: B_ button and the F_ button, they don't do anything.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah yeah.\nuser interface: I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like, I don't know you, just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like, no, you never use half of them. So.\nproject manager: You what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen, so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions. Like the way a mobile phone does.\nuser interface: That would be cool.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. I mean it just seems like \nproject manager: So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels, you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh \nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: what do you call it \nmarketing: Select. Uh.\nproject manager: s y yeah but you can programme, so you can programme like your favourite channels, so like if you had a s\nmarketing: But, would you have the screen on the thing, or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen.\nproject manager: That's something we could decide. Mm.\nmarketing: Because \nuser interface: I guess they would go together somehow? I dunno.\nmarketing: Because, I don't know if it's I think it's e expensive, if you have if you use the telly screen, 'cause the telly's already a screen, then you can pro sort of have a programming function, really easy sort of arrow up and down, on the remote,\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: and then use the telly as a screen.\nproject manager: Right.\nmarketing: But um \nuser interface: I'm thinking kind of \nmarketing: But yeah for sure. Something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: is that what you mean?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right. Mm.\nuser interface: Or like you h you see those you know people I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic, and they have like this one master control that and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen, I don't know if it must be it would probably \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah. Yeah that's true.\nproject manager: Yeah. I mean, we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Um but it's something to think about, yeah.\nuser interface: Well, I guess we have to get to that later, yeah.\nproject manager: I mean we'll have to see how much that would be.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Or some it i we can find out probably on the internet how much it's \nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um. Yeah, and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What was the word?\nuser interface: Furry.\nmarketing: Water resistant.\nproject manager: Oh I was just {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No but it's I thought, ah, spot on.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Good feel, tact tactile, good tactile feel,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot.\nuser interface: Yeah. Mm, mm.\nmarketing: That's quite annoying.\nproject manager: Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it, like so you can clip it to your \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: like that's another \nmarketing: Yeah, clip. Ooh. Um.\nproject manager: Um. We should probably start wrapping up, um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into. Um, and come up with some new ones for the next meeting, which will be in another thirty minutes. Um. So. Yeah. The Industrial Designer, what does that stand for, I_D_,\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think so.\nproject manager: yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design. So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing. The something, what is the U_I_?\nindustrial designer: User.\nproject manager: Yeah, what does it stand for again?\nuser interface: That's me. Uh, User Interface design.\nproject manager: User Interface Designer. So that's gonna be more technical. I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w\nuser interface: So technical function.\nindustrial designer: The working design is the structure.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what \nproject manager: Um, I guess you'd have to find out.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Um.\nmarketing: It says on that email but it \nindustrial designer: It was in the email.\nuser interface: It does but it I just don't really \nindustrial designer: I wrote down what mine were.\nmarketing: It said um \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: It said \nuser interface: What effect should the thing ha should it have, okay. Alright.\nmarketing: Yeah\nuser interface: And working design.\nmarketing: like \nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Be a medium between you and the telly I think,\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah. Alright.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: that's uh \nuser interface: And how it works, okay. Right. I'm I'm on task.\nproject manager: And the M_E_, what does that stand for? M\nindustrial designer: Marketing.\nproject manager: Marketing, right. Um.\nmarketing: Marketing. Oh it's written here, but um.\nproject manager: So we'll be working on the user requirements, um Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So I guess that wraps it up.

Is it fancy?\nproject manager: Yeah, I think so.\nuser interface: Um the yellow rubber, I think so.\nindustrial designer: I think so.\nproject manager: You like the rubber, uh Roo. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I'm into it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So uh one?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But it's not that fancy.\nproject manager: No, I'll I'll I'll give it a two.\nindustrial designer: I mean I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing. It would be even more \nproject manager: You like tita {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: oh, you really like titanium. I'm I'm into it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's a flavour as well.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It has flavour. Yes, that's right. You should taste it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right. Um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, I know,\nmarketing: Is it uh \nproject manager: but but it but that's fancy in the way um I mean fancy has has a lot of \nindustrial designer: It has to do with fashion, I guess.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It's trendy trendy, fun {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So do \nmarketing: And w\nuser interface: yeah.\nmarketing: yeah, w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So in that way It it's fancy.\nproject manager: It applies. It yeah.\nuser interface: Well, just give it a two.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: It's not the ultimate uh fancy two, but \nindustrial designer: I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case. It would have been even more fancy, but we decided not to, because if we use a double-curved case, we could not use solar.\nuser interface: Yeah, but that's sti that's uh \nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: Looking at the user uh needs, we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case. We w we do have uh the rubber, we do have the colours. That's two out of three. So I believe uh we are close uh to two.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Yeah, I I agree.\nindustrial designer: Yes, I agree too. It's okay. We did  yes, we did good.\nmarketing: Okay, and uh was it innovative?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh \nuser interface: But that's not in it. Ov or can we \nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: No, we are evaluating this this uh design now. This prototype.\nindustrial designer: Well, let's let's this product.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So I I I think it is. I think it's innovative.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And the scroll uh wheel. The solar not many remotes have the solar, I think.\nindustrial designer: No. It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source, but it's it's way too \nmarketing: Yeah, and uh \nproject manager: That would have been a thrill.\nindustrial designer: yes, but \nmarketing: So uh also a uh two?\nindustrial designer: I think uh it's a two.\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: Is it easy to use?\nproject manager: I'm not sure. I'm not sure.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well yeah, the voice recognition of course is hard to learn, I think. Well, hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly. They won't use it.\nindustrial designer: Well, but there are two parts in this remote control. What you see here is is the basic part. Everybody can use it, so that's easy to use.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's for a novice user. When you have a more advanced, elaborate user, well, such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions. So in that in that way it is advanced,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users.\nuser interface: I think I think a three.\nindustrial designer: So uh It's maybe it's not very uh easy for \nuser interface: Wouldn't give it more.\nproject manager: Uh I'm doubting doubting as well. Um \nmarketing: Well the p the most important function is easy to use. The the zapping, channel switching, volume. But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh two or three? Three? Wha wh what would be your guess? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: It's the uh it's it's overall. Is the device easy to use?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's right. You're right in that, but I  I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because he is already he or she is already an advanced user.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Um Okay.\nindustrial designer: After all, I think personally I would give a two. But \nproject manager: Uh Roo, a three?\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Ruud?\nmarketing: Good question. Uh I'll go uh for the two.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So, it's two, two and three. Two threes. So that's ten.\nproject manager: So I could make it e easy?\nuser interface: If you make it a four it will be three in general.\nindustrial designer: So that's w No, two and a half.\nuser interface: If he makes it a four. Not a three.\nindustrial designer: Six and four. Six and four is ten. Divided by four is two and a half. So \nuser interface: Darn. Nee.\nindustrial designer: Yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm? Huh?\nproject manager: Roo. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: A seven, a three No.\nmarketing: Yeah. I yeah .\nuser interface: A four and a three together.\nindustrial designer: Four?\nuser interface: Yeah, you have a two, he has a two. Three?\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Two?\nmarketing: two, two, three \nproject manager: No,\nuser interface: And a three?\nproject manager: I haven't said anything yet.\nuser interface: Nee. I know.\nmarketing: No. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, but if I would say a three, then it's six, and four is ten. Divided by four is two point five.\nindustrial designer: Divided by four.\nuser interface: Yes. So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three. Then you would make a four. If you fill out a four {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But I'm filling in a three.\nindustrial designer: That's not even \nproject manager: Does it will so it will be a two point five.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But that's not possible to fill in,\nproject manager: Yes, it is.\nindustrial designer: so we have to round it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Is it easy to find? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I have a veto. Exactly. It's not about the content, it's about okay, um is it easy to f Yeah, definitely.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out, but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find.\nindustrial designer: It it most definitely is it's very easy.\nproject manager: Yeah, or beeps or yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh \nindustrial designer: Yes. Maybe Uh I I think I think \nproject manager: I'm here, I'm here. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: something like that. Maybe you have to uh programme it once, so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence, something like where are you, and then it will sing I'm here. So something like that.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: But even without it \nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, I uh \nindustrial designer: So, I th\nproject manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time, but I personally give it a one.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um Sebastian?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, me too.\nuser interface: Me too.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nproject manager: Right, well. The feel of the remote control is spongy. Well, uh\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it can't be more spongy. So {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, it can be. There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable.\nuser interface: Was it one of our options?\nindustrial designer: No, it's not one of our option,\nmarketing: No. Uh\nproject manager: No okay, but but\nuser interface: So, in the in \nindustrial designer: but when you look in the market, when you look \nmarketing: this this was a most spongy option. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: for the options given, it's the most spongy one.\nindustrial designer: Uh yes,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about, I think. Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy. They're out there. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: They're out there. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes, but it's not good enough,\nproject manager: I'll give it a one.\nindustrial designer: so it's a two.\nuser interface: I wan I'll take one.\nindustrial designer: You take one? What do you give it?\nmarketing: Well yeah, it depends, 'cause it's the most spongy we could \nproject manager: Yeah, I know, but you have to name a fig uh a number. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but yeah.\nproject manager: Because we need to go on in for the time.\nmarketing: Well, if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation.\nuser interface: It will be a one. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five.\nindustrial designer: No no no. Uh I'll I'll change it, I'll make it m my my mark will be a four. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You are \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The remote control offers enough features.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, Ruud, what what do you think about it?\nmarketing: Well, the basic layout doesn't offem offer much, but the voice recognition could add a lot. So \nindustrial designer: Basically it's it's completely programmable.\nmarketing: Yeah, depends.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode.\nproject manager: Yeah, I know.\nindustrial designer: So it's quite advanced.\nproject manager: What what we didn't talk about is um uh \nuser interface: Yeah, but it ha doesn't has the digits. I believe it's If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features, I don't I don't think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has.\nproject manager: I think it has.\nmarketing: Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat\nproject manager: Yeah. Bec because you can um we didn't talk about it, but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal. So,\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one, hit the one or the two or the three, whatever, and it r records the uh the um  the the signals.\nindustrial designer: Has uh the signals sent to it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Signal.\nproject manager: So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like, as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal. So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features.\nindustrial designer: Absolutely.\nproject manager: Although there are i a few buttons, but the inside is is quite uh advanced.\nindustrial designer: Yes. But that that's its power, I guess, because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains, well, uh really a lot of buttons. At at least uh forty buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to. And this is quite s simple.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: You can use your voice to to programme it. It's \nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, um let's give it a number. I'll give it uh a one. For for the for this t uh type of market, I think it's a one.\nuser interface: I'll give a two.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I'll give it a one.\nmarketing: Um I think think a one, 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want, so that's like um \nindustrial designer: Yes. I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good, but not for this kind of market, and not for this kind of price.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: So high quality, low acceptance.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced. But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well, is not sure.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: D do you agree?\nindustrial designer: Yes, I agree. I \nmarketing: Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced.\nproject manager: Yeah. Maybe we should have a radar uh function. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But Yes.\nuser interface: But we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price? Fifty?\nproject manager: Twenty five Euros.\nuser interface: Uh twenty five. And costs were twelve fifty.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But even now, if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double, Think. Production cost was were t uh was twenty two?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So uh selling price uh would be uh \nindustrial designer: M about fifty Euros.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's quite ex\nuser interface: That's price, but w w\nindustrial designer: well, it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality.\nuser interface: No. An original remote control of any T_V_ kind, uh a Phillips remote control, y you pay uh \nindustrial designer: Yes, it's more than fifty Euros. It's quite expensive, yes.\nuser interface: Yeah, I kn I know uh from a few years ago, it it it costed hundred Gilders.\nproject manager: Bu but well yeah, I know, but you're paying for th for the brand, because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo, television, D_V_D_, C_D_ player, for under twenty five Euros.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes, but you can you c Yes, but you can learn this thing, all these functions.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition\nproject manager: .\nindustrial designer: and this one does.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So I think it's worth its price.\nproject manager: Okay. Um you had an overall rating. Um \nmarketing: Yeah, but uh with these ratings uh\nproject manager: That's counting.\nindustrial designer: Well, it's it's about one point five. Something like that.\nmarketing: should be about one point s seven,\nuser interface: Four six seven eight.\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Nine divided by six.\nproject manager: Okay. Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation. About the project itself, not about the product. Um What did you think about uh the process, the project process? Ruud?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Try to translate that. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Any any other Uh, Roo?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think uh \nindustrial designer: Well, I think \nmarketing: Ye\nproject manager: Roo. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The process was good.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And and that was the the big deal. I if we knew that before, we c we could have made\nindustrial designer: Mm. Actually, we had \nuser interface: the the choice between what \nproject manager: Better decision.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: We had we had too little information actually.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So And uh um the the the well, looking at room for creativity, there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow.\nproject manager: Less. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So there was not really a process of uh \nproject manager: So we could we we could be we could've been creative. But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price.\nindustrial designer: Well Yes.\nmarketing: The prices.\nindustrial designer: Well, in the first meeting we we already were very creative.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components. So \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We're tempered by that, yes.\nproject manager: Okay, Roo? Any other thoughts on that?\nuser interface: No, no.\nproject manager: Ruud?\nmarketing: I agree.\nproject manager: You agree, okay. Uh leadership.\nuser interface: Fantastic. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, Roo's on for his promotion. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I think we're a good team.\nproject manager: I think so too, it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment. I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh, hey Roo uh . Um \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, I tried once, but that was not allowed. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. So um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but but si uh w w w  when taken in account the the situation, uh I think we performed pretty well.\nindustrial designer: I think so too.\nproject manager: Yeah. Um\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: the means, the SMARTboard, the digital pen. Did you like 'em?\nindustrial designer: Uh. The digital pen was okay, but SMARTboard was really bad.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Because of the response\nindustrial designer: It it's \nproject manager: or \nuser interface: Response\nindustrial designer: The response is very slow\nuser interface: and \nindustrial designer: and the possibilities are very limited. It's not accurate.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh \nuser interface: Uh it it has yeah. Yeah, it's not accurate. The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh \nmarketing: Draws.\nuser interface: Yeah, where it draws. It's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen.\nproject manager: Okay, so\nuser interface: So uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it it had to be um better aligned, or what's the word?\nuser interface: You to take in account that your you m\nproject manager: Uh yeah.\nuser interface: yeah uh \nindustrial designer: Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds.\nuser interface: It's too slow \nproject manager: It it was calibrated just before this meeting. Uh the one before, the third meeting.\nindustrial designer: It is?\nproject manager: So uh it's not the calibration,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: it's the thing itself, I think.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Uh Ruud, w uh did you use the pen a lot? Or not at all?\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Not at all.\nmarketing: Not really.\nproject manager: Okay. I thought it was quite a handy uh thing,\nindustrial designer: I I think so too.\nproject manager: although I would like to see um O_C_R_.\nuser interface: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes.\nuser interface: If it has O_C_R_, uh I think uh I would use, but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It w it w yeah. It was necessary for me to uh \nproject manager: To digitise them.\nuser interface: Yeah, because if I want something on the computer, I just type it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I type faster than I write.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem, uh writing down some notes, some some inf uh information, and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think it's a good product. I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's not quite uh ergonomic. Eco ergonomic.\nuser interface: Economic.\nproject manager: I know.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay. Um What w Uh Ruud, what did you think about the SMARTboards?\nmarketing: Oh, I only use it to draw a rabbit,\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, you can't really decide. No.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so can't say much about it.\nproject manager: I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops. I think that would be very easy if you could say okay, I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: No, or the other way around.\nproject manager: Or the other way around, that you could show but m\nindustrial designer: Yes, yes.\nuser interface: But y you can \nindustrial designer: That's quite what PowerPoint does.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I know.\nuser interface: if you save this image, you can open it in your shared work folder.\nproject manager: I know, but \nuser interface: So it's almost \nproject manager: I know, but we couldn't use that feature,\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: so I missed it.\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: We weren't able to do that. At least the um I wasn't explained how to do such a th\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object.\nindustrial designer: An object, yes. Yes.\nuser interface: I it's not possible \nindustrial designer: The drawing cap capabilities are very limited.\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows, you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons, uh which you can use for drawing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And a lot of these buttons don't appear here. So it's \nuser interface: Oh it looks like paint actually.\nproject manager: Okay, so y it it's not even as advanced as paint.\nindustrial designer: Not not uh n not way.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's quite uh limited.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh no. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, the project is evaluated. Um but, well, we need to redesign uh the product.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Oh, very good, celebration.\nproject manager: Celebrate\nuser interface: Great. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Pop uh pop up the champagne. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Um\nuser interface: It was a privilege working with you. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you're dismissed. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No, I think we are uh ready.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: To private rooms? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I see some action over there.\nproject manager: Private room, Roo. That sounds quite scary.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: No, let's find uh the way to . .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: uh we're done, we're finished, I believe. So, are there any more cycles in this process? I think not.\nproject manager: I don't believe so. Well, maybe we'd get an email. Thank you for your \nindustrial designer: But um how much time did we get for this meeting?\nproject manager: Forty minutes.\nindustrial designer: And how much time is left?\nproject manager: A minute or or ten maybe. M\nindustrial designer: Ten minutes.\nproject manager: Yeah, ten or five.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: So, we can uh redesign our uh Uh I would like to \nindustrial designer: Well, I think we we we all know what the redesign should be. A simple, dull, uh one-coloured box.\nmarketing: And no added value. At all.\nindustrial designer: No, it's it's just the same product that is already on the market.\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Oh.\nuser interface: But you see the problem,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: y you can't continue your uh your line. Well, it's fluffy alright. Spongy. A giraffe? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: What is that?\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree.\nproject manager: It's blue tongue.\nmarketing: In interesting design.\nproject manager: Yeah. This is a new model. But {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So you're actually promoting Bluetooth. Or blue tongue. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Blue tongue. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling.\nproject manager: It's spongy. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: . That is uh it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices. Um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Blue tongue.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Right.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Let's wrap it up.\nproject manager: Yeah, we're done here.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Gentlemen, thank you for your cooperation.\nindustrial designer: Thank you Mister manager. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Now, let's have uh a bottle of champagne.\nuser interface: . Leave it here.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: That's alright. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: .\nmarketing: .\nproject manager: ", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "This is the fourth meeting of the design group.

{"fname": "product_test_9", "dialogue": "project manager: The basic okay. Okay. Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria?\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Uh my name is not name\nproject manager: You are nameless. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well, I used the  the uh documents. And these uh were the most important criteria.\nindustrial designer: Is it spongy? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It should be.  yeah,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it. Fancy look and feel. So \nuser interface: So just walk through it step by step. I mean, is it fancy, everything I believe uh I believe it's fancy. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well appar\nindustrial designer: I believe it's fancy too.\nmarketing: Yeah, but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: Oh, sorry.\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Okay, so\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: this these are the cr uh the criteria.\nmarketing: Yeah, I think these are the most important criteria.\nproject manager: Okay, well \nmarketing: So uh\nproject manager: the then we'll switch to my presentation. Um \nmarketing: that's about it.\nindustrial designer: Is it fancy? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I d it is it is {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yay. Is it? Is it fancy?\nproject manager: Yeah, I think so.\nuser interface: Um the yellow rubber, I think so.\nindustrial designer: I think so.\nproject manager: You like the rubber, uh Roo. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I'm into it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So uh one?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But it's not that fancy.\nproject manager: No, I'll I'll I'll give it a two.\nindustrial designer: I mean I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing. It would be even more \nproject manager: You like tita {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: oh, you really like titanium. I'm I'm into it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's a flavour as well.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It has flavour. Yes, that's right. You should taste it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right. Um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, I know,\nmarketing: Is it uh \nproject manager: but but it but that's fancy in the way um I mean fancy has has a lot of \nindustrial designer: It has to do with fashion, I guess.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It's trendy trendy, fun {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So do \nmarketing: And w\nuser interface: yeah.\nmarketing: yeah, w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So in that way It it's fancy.\nproject manager: It applies. It yeah.\nuser interface: Well, just give it a two.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: It's not the ultimate uh fancy two, but \nindustrial designer: I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case. It would have been even more fancy, but we decided not to, because if we use a double-curved case, we could not use solar.\nuser interface: Yeah, but that's sti that's uh \nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: Looking at the user uh needs, we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case. We w we do have uh the rubber, we do have the colours. That's two out of three. So I believe uh we are close uh to two.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Yeah, I I agree.\nindustrial designer: Yes, I agree too. It's okay. We did  yes, we did good.\nmarketing: Okay, and uh was it innovative?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: with the voice recognition feature and uh \nuser interface: But that's not in it. Ov or can we \nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: No, we are evaluating this this uh design now. This prototype.\nindustrial designer: Well, let's let's this product.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So I I I think it is. I think it's innovative.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And the scroll uh wheel. The solar not many remotes have the solar, I think.\nindustrial designer: No. It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source, but it's it's way too \nmarketing: Yeah, and uh \nproject manager: That would have been a thrill.\nindustrial designer: yes, but \nmarketing: So uh also a uh two?\nindustrial designer: I think uh it's a two.\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: Is it easy to use?\nproject manager: I'm not sure. I'm not sure.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well yeah, the voice recognition of course is hard to learn, I think. Well, hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly. They won't use it.\nindustrial designer: Well, but there are two parts in this remote control. What you see here is is the basic part. Everybody can use it, so that's easy to use.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's for a novice user. When you have a more advanced, elaborate user, well, such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions. So in that in that way it is advanced,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users.\nuser interface: I think I think a three.\nindustrial designer: So uh It's maybe it's not very uh easy for \nuser interface: Wouldn't give it more.\nproject manager: Uh I'm doubting doubting as well. Um \nmarketing: Well the p the most important function is easy to use. The the zapping, channel switching, volume. But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh two or three? Three? Wha wh what would be your guess? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: It's the uh it's it's overall. Is the device easy to use?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's right. You're right in that, but I  I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because he is already he or she is already an advanced user.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Um Okay.\nindustrial designer: After all, I think personally I would give a two. But \nproject manager: Uh Roo, a three?\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Ruud?\nmarketing: Good question. Uh I'll go uh for the two.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So, it's two, two and three. Two threes. So that's ten.\nproject manager: So I could make it e easy?\nuser interface: If you make it a four it will be three in general.\nindustrial designer: So that's w No, two and a half.\nuser interface: If he makes it a four. Not a three.\nindustrial designer: Six and four. Six and four is ten. Divided by four is two and a half. So \nuser interface: Darn. Nee.\nindustrial designer: Yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm? Huh?\nproject manager: Roo. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: A seven, a three No.\nmarketing: Yeah. I yeah .\nuser interface: A four and a three together.\nindustrial designer: Four?\nuser interface: Yeah, you have a two, he has a two. Three?\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Two?\nmarketing: two, two, three \nproject manager: No,\nuser interface: And a three?\nproject manager: I haven't said anything yet.\nuser interface: Nee. I know.\nmarketing: No. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, but if I would say a three, then it's six, and four is ten. Divided by four is two point five.\nindustrial designer: Divided by four.\nuser interface: Yes. So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three. Then you would make a four. If you fill out a four {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But I'm filling in a three.\nindustrial designer: That's not even \nproject manager: Does it will so it will be a two point five.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But that's not possible to fill in,\nproject manager: Yes, it is.\nindustrial designer: so we have to round it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Is it easy to find? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I have a veto. Exactly. It's not about the content, it's about okay, um is it easy to f Yeah, definitely.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out, but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find.\nindustrial designer: It it most definitely is it's very easy.\nproject manager: Yeah, or beeps or yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh \nindustrial designer: Yes. Maybe Uh I I think I think \nproject manager: I'm here, I'm here. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: something like that. Maybe you have to uh programme it once, so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence, something like where are you, and then it will sing I'm here. So something like that.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: But even without it \nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, I uh \nindustrial designer: So, I th\nproject manager: we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time, but I personally give it a one.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um Sebastian?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, me too.\nuser interface: Me too.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nproject manager: Right, well. The feel of the remote control is spongy. Well, uh\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it can't be more spongy. So {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, it can be. There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable.\nuser interface: Was it one of our options?\nindustrial designer: No, it's not one of our option,\nmarketing: No. Uh\nproject manager: No okay, but but\nuser interface: So, in the in \nindustrial designer: but when you look in the market, when you look \nmarketing: this this was a most spongy option. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: for the options given, it's the most spongy one.\nindustrial designer: Uh yes,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about, I think. Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy. They're out there. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: They're out there. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes, but it's not good enough,\nproject manager: I'll give it a one.\nindustrial designer: so it's a two.\nuser interface: I wan I'll take one.\nindustrial designer: You take one? What do you give it?\nmarketing: Well yeah, it depends, 'cause it's the most spongy we could \nproject manager: Yeah, I know, but you have to name a fig uh a number. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but yeah.\nproject manager: Because we need to go on in for the time.\nmarketing: Well, if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation.\nuser interface: It will be a one. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five.\nindustrial designer: No no no. Uh I'll I'll change it, I'll make it m my my mark will be a four. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You are \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The remote control offers enough features.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, Ruud, what what do you think about it?\nmarketing: Well, the basic layout doesn't offem offer much, but the voice recognition could add a lot. So \nindustrial designer: Basically it's it's completely programmable.\nmarketing: Yeah, depends.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode.\nproject manager: Yeah, I know.\nindustrial designer: So it's quite advanced.\nproject manager: What what we didn't talk about is um uh \nuser interface: Yeah, but it ha doesn't has the digits. I believe it's If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features, I don't I don't think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has.\nproject manager: I think it has.\nmarketing: Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat\nproject manager: Yeah. Bec because you can um we didn't talk about it, but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal. So,\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one, hit the one or the two or the three, whatever, and it r records the uh the um  the the signals.\nindustrial designer: Has uh the signals sent to it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Signal.\nproject manager: So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like, as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal. So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features.\nindustrial designer: Absolutely.\nproject manager: Although there are i a few buttons, but the inside is is quite uh advanced.\nindustrial designer: Yes. But that that's its power, I guess, because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains, well, uh really a lot of buttons. At at least uh forty buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to. And this is quite s simple.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: You can use your voice to to programme it. It's \nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, um let's give it a number. I'll give it uh a one. For for the for this t uh type of market, I think it's a one.\nuser interface: I'll give a two.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I'll give it a one.\nmarketing: Um I think think a one, 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want, so that's like um \nindustrial designer: Yes. I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good, but not for this kind of market, and not for this kind of price.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: So high quality, low acceptance.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion about evaluation criteria of remote control.", "zh_query": "总结有关遥控器评估标准的讨论。", "fr_query": "Résumez la discussion sur les critères d'évaluation de la télécommande.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте обговорення критеріїв оцінки пульту дистанційного керування.", "en_summary": "The group thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria.

{"fname": "product_test_12", "dialogue": "project manager: The production costs. The costs are not under Can I Um this is the \nuser interface: Twenty two.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty.\nuser interface: Yikes.\nproject manager: And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell. So I guess we should skip that,\nindustrial designer: Well it's very expensive.\nproject manager: because it's not that important.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Why does the price and and the s oh, one uh exa\nproject manager: Yeah, the the price, the the number of items and the the sum.\nuser interface: yeah. The number of uh yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Um well, this is what I would call our luxury model. Um if you would \nuser interface: And and does it \nproject manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty, um then I did the following changes. Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells, um by not using the voice recognition feature,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um Yeah, I believe Uh, push-button, well It makes it the thirteen yeah. Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive, but do add extra cost.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: So um yeah, th this design is not um within our price model.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Um \nindustrial designer: But I'm afraid it's not complete. Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials, the last item. And you have not added one item there.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it's c way too expensive.\nproject manager: It's still too expensive, yeah. Um \nuser interface: But that's that's only for the buttons.\nproject manager: I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out, um \nuser interface: So the button we can use plastic.\nproject manager: oh. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And uh maybe not use the special form.\nuser interface: And the pla uh And a plastic b just plastic buttons, a plas uh instead of rubber.\nindustrial designer: But it \nproject manager: It becomes a very dull remote control, I know.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: But it's the board decision. Um And um yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well, b basically it when when this is our only option, we should even consider changing the casing, because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, I know. Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh \nindustrial designer: So Type of m maybe another market segment.\nproject manager: Yeah, m uh maybe not not all that fancy, but just way way more easy uh uh um basic\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and uh m maximise the profits\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: and um \nindustrial designer: That's maybe that's better. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but that's not what uh has been asked.\nproject manager: I know, I know.\nindustrial designer: So we should kick the board's uh Well \nproject manager: Yeah. Although I think we yeah, but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device. Definitely not, no. It's not that innovative.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Or however you s pronounce that.\nuser interface: Yeah, too bad. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so, okay. Um Oh,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: this is the wrong one. So uh that means redesign. We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went. Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first. I guess \nmarketing: Um well, since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, that's true.\nindustrial designer: Well, maybe it's good to do it anyway, because if we evaluate it, we we can also determine if our objectives are good.\nproject manager: We l we can learn. Yeah. Yeah. I agree.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Well \nproject manager: The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced. But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well, is not sure.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: D do you agree?\nindustrial designer: Yes, I agree. I \nmarketing: Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced.\nproject manager: Yeah. Maybe we should have a radar uh function. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But Yes.\nuser interface: But we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price?

Yes, but you can you c Yes, but you can learn this thing, all these functions.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition\nproject manager: .\nindustrial designer: and this one does.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So I think it's worth its price.\nproject manager: Okay.

The costs are not under Can I Um this is the \nuser interface: Twenty two.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty.\nuser interface: Yikes.\nproject manager: And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell. So I guess we should skip that,\nindustrial designer: Well it's very expensive.\nproject manager: because it's not that important.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Why does the price and and the s oh, one uh exa\nproject manager: Yeah, the the price, the the number of items and the the sum.\nuser interface: yeah. The number of uh yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Um well, this is what I would call our luxury model. Um if you would \nuser interface: And and does it \nproject manager: if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty, um then I did the following changes. Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells, um by not using the voice recognition feature,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um Yeah, I believe Uh, push-button, well It makes it the thirteen yeah. Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive, but do add extra cost.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: So um yeah, th this design is not um within our price model.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Um \nindustrial designer: But I'm afraid it's not complete. Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials, the last item. And you have not added one item there.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it's c way too expensive.\nproject manager: It's still too expensive, yeah. Um \nuser interface: But that's that's only for the buttons.\nproject manager: I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out, um \nuser interface: So the button we can use plastic.\nproject manager: oh. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And uh maybe not use the special form.\nuser interface: And the pla uh And a plastic b just plastic buttons, a plas uh instead of rubber.\nindustrial designer: But it \nproject manager: It becomes a very dull remote control, I know.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: But it's the board decision. Um And um yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well, b basically it when when this is our only option, we should even consider changing the casing, because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, I know. Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh \nindustrial designer: So Type of m maybe another market segment.\nproject manager: Yeah, m uh maybe not not all that fancy, but just way way more easy uh uh um basic\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and uh m maximise the profits\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: and um \nindustrial designer: That's maybe that's better. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but that's not what uh has been asked.\nproject manager: I know, I know.\nindustrial designer: So we should kick the board's uh Well \nproject manager: Yeah. Although I think we yeah, but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device.

Um the minutes from the last time. Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. Um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition, we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, just a different shape from what's normal, um. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost,\nuser interface: \nproject manager: things like that,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: um and our market was going to be young, business, kind of range.\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation?\nmarketing: Shall I?\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Yes if you feel \nmarketing: Okay. We just connect up.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: Thank you. There we go. Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. Um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: sorry Project Manager. Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important, but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, um, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials, uh again in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback there, both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan. Be interesting to see what our design people make of that.\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Okay thank you very much. Um\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: let's start from the inside and work our way out.\nuser interface: Fine. It's okay with me.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay. \nmarketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that?\nproject manager: I don't think so, not yet.\nmarketing: Not yet? 'Kay.\nproject manager: Um, yes, thank you.\nindustrial designer: That screwed in? \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: I hate those little things\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them.\nmarketing: I know.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay, \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay, first uh the Into the method. The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find. Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials, 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available.\nproject manager: 'Kay..\nindustrial designer: Um, findings, I've got my nice little picture there. This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals, based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: There's um actually no rechargeable option available, so we I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging, I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest,\nproject manager: Wa can you explain that?\nindustrial designer: people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio.\nproject manager: Like a right, okay.\nindustrial designer: So you wind up your remote control before you use it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: How what kind of how l long can you get out of that,\nindustrial designer: It might \nproject manager: I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? Or \nindustrial designer: You Yeah, yeah, oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long, but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options, like the the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_.\nproject manager: That doesn't count though does it?\nmarketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does?\nproject manager: I thought it was U_V_ like \nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Artificial light?\nindustrial designer: Is it? Alright i\nproject manager: Any, any \nmarketing: Has to be solar.\nuser interface: Yep. Regarding those sizes, which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also, so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space.\nindustrial designer: Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up.\nproject manager: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Uh, I don't think it counts electric lights\nmarketing: Mm. Artificial light, no.\nproject manager: no, but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market.\nmarketing: That's going to \nproject manager: I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people, but there are people.\nuser interface: Uh \nmarketing: I know,\nindustrial designer: But \nmarketing: different parts of the world too, if we're if we're marketing internationally.\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nuser interface: Right.\nindustrial designer: and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway.\nuser interface: Night.\nproject manager: Mm, but then it would be charging through the day, I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening.\nindustrial designer: But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches\nproject manager: Yeah I've seen \nindustrial designer: and you d you don't even notice it. I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work.\nuser interface: And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery, it like it runs for long time?\nindustrial designer: Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out .\nuser interface: We c\nproject manager: But then if you think about a watch, it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: so you're walking around, you're doing things, it is moving a lot of the time. If you'd \nindustrial designer: Yeah and \nproject manager: I mean you switch the T_V_ on, then you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but then again\nproject manager: Is it really gonna be enough?\nindustrial designer: I I think it is because if you think about it, the watch, although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And th for the same the same reason, you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it\nproject manager: So it's not the draw on it isn't \nindustrial designer: and you put it \nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be \nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Could I just ask referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with um standard batteries?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: I mean, could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging\nindustrial designer: Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing\nmarketing: or the two things not compatible?\nproject manager: Like a dual kind of.\nindustrial designer: but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because, if you lie  on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical.\nmarketing: Mm. So that affects the exterior design.\nuser interface: Solar would be slightly expensives.\nproject manager: Expensive as well. What kind of price are we looking at for \nindustrial designer: They're they're expensive, they don't \nuser interface: It's twelve point f\nproject manager: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones, um but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping,\nproject manager: Solar.\nindustrial designer: 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y\nproject manager: Well they're not designed \nindustrial designer: the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff, so.\nproject manager: Practical-wise okay.\nindustrial designer: Y I think yeah, practically. I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do,\nproject manager: You do get a bit of wear\nindustrial designer: they can t\nproject manager: but don't calculators have a battery in them as well?\nindustrial designer: Yeah they do, they yeah they've got dual things, but they're the batteries are smaller I think.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Another question is like \nmarketing: Again it de\nuser interface: sorry. W w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: A remote control, like,\nindustrial designer: W m yeah\nuser interface: so we have to s look at the life also.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging, um, I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last.\nmarketing: It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature,\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think i I think it would, yeah.\nmarketing: i it's not gonna add anything, okay.\nproject manager: Okay, can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature?\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Can we think about that? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally \nproject manager: Well add it in to think about um\nmarketing: right, okay.\nproject manager: because, where am I? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less, you you wouldn't lose it so much.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: the eternal battle for control of the controls.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research,\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: it's not a thing that people are looking for\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So \nmarketing: when we threw it open to the field yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe.\nproject manager: Okay, right.\nindustrial designer: Okay, well I'll move on.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um, my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board, which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button, it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts.\nproject manager: What kind of things do we have to consider there? Can we what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of \nindustrial designer: Well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in. If you if you see how thin the tracks are, you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that, or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so that And then to uh yeah, so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off, if we decided to go for buttons that could light up.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um, the case material, I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us, the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical. Titanium um very expensive just to process,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: which to make it is expensive, and rubber, well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year, so perhaps uh some something made of rubber,\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons, because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said. Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape, whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes. But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units\nuser interface: Second thing is \nproject manager: Hinged, yeah.\nindustrial designer: for the flip phone.\nuser interface: yeah and second question is like, a mobile you can change the cover, you call it a skin or whatever.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green, parrot green to chilli red or something like that.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So is that feature available in like uh titanium,\nindustrial designer: Yeah I th\nuser interface: or it's like only specific to plastic or \nindustrial designer: Uh. Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really, the ju just \nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it w well you could make it available in the titanium, it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it, because of the expense of how much titanium is is \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote.\nmarketing: It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall. I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over,\nindustrial designer: Rubber, yeah.\nmarketing: that would give the spongy feel, that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone.\nindustrial designer: And you can peel them off yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber,\nmarketing: Like a rubber sleeve almost, yeah.\nuser interface: Something like \nproject manager: like those pens that you get with the grip, that you can you can pull that off.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: That could be a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: It could it would be comfortable to hold on also.\nproject manager: Okay. Mm.\nindustrial designer: T\nmarketing: Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not.\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Also the \nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons, the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough, that would be one option. Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons, but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space, two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch\nuser interface: Sorry I didn't get the last part, you're talking of \nindustrial designer: display. Uh what what \nuser interface: Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely, you're saying like \nindustrial designer: Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it \nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off, you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_, you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: With W also with the \nmarketing: I don't s sorry to interrupt, I don't see why the curved thing is a problem, if we for example had a shell, once we open that \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Oh it would be flat inside.\nindustrial designer: You could have a flat screen inside, yeah,\nmarketing: yeah, so it'd be f yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside.\nmarketing: Have I misunderstood you?\nindustrial designer: It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but there'd be touch touch buttons,\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em, w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_.\nproject manager: I think it would be good to have a contrast between, if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Is rubber. Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Now how would you distinguish, if you had it bare, how would you distinguish where you had to press, I mean \nindustrial designer: Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest.\nproject manager: Uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I just had another idea, I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the R_S_I_. Is it possible, just as an option, when we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button, or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you could, you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out\nproject manager: Like one of the palm pop thing.\nindustrial designer: but I I think they could get a bit easily lost,\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Absolutely, f for somebody who very often, if he would \nindustrial designer: 'cause I had \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: It would have to be attached.\nmarketing: They're easy to replace as well, cheap.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like, if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah okay.\nmarketing: Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got, couldn't they? A pencil or a pen, so they wouldn't really need a \nproject manager: Okay, we'll talk about that so if you finish your \nindustrial designer: Yeah that's \nproject manager: and we'll come back to that.\nindustrial designer: yeah that that's the end of m my \nproject manager: That's you, right okay.\nuser interface: And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit, since we are hav having a flip-top, we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing, so we can divide the circuit like you know.\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah. Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them,\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking.\nmarketing: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me, it kind of applies to both our designers here, so I'm not sure how it would fit in.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: If we flip open, now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display, you seen those?\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: And they kind of respond to the turn of your body. Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing.\nproject manager: We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women.\nindustrial designer: Um.\nmarketing: They don't look at themselves? Just a thought.\nproject manager: Well it's a remote control, you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. I know what you mean, it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, no, no.\nmarketing: trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: but maybe we'll leave that one on the side.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: I mean you can you could do it, you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out,\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it, I'm not sure about \nmarketing: Oh I think forget about the mirror\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nmarketing: that was just a very quick passing thought yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, uh would like to share something which I did here. First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. Second is we checked into competitors, the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh, people need trendy, they are bored of black and white.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here. No particular remote is standard.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Like, some some people have a Here you see this? This is on a I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control, rest other buttons, they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, and second as already discussed with William, we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: and g graphic user interface\nmarketing: Sorry what does that stand for?\nproject manager: Which means \nuser interface: basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever,\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: which is \nindustrial designer: If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen.\nuser interface: Like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So basically not point or click  Press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device, that means the use of button. So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So we are having a combination of boards, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels.\nproject manager: Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part?\nuser interface: \nproject manager: 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press, just like a mobile phone.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you? Isn't that the idea? You us if we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. That's what I was just saying,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah but you can do it with your thumb li\nuser interface: But \nproject manager: and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and then be able to touch that for the other controls,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Okay and you mean to the \nproject manager: so have the um the volume and the programme, things like that,\nuser interface: And the lower distance.\nproject manager: on the lower side.\nuser interface: Oh f perfect.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nuser interface: So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained, example the volume and channel control buttons. All are confusing and in inconsistent. Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also? And technologically innovative also.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this. My personal preferences would be like, as already uh marketing department, they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, uh red chilli uh\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have, like for example, i if you see the previous slide uh\nindustrial designer: Well, yeah we \nuser interface: I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern, here, so we we we would not change h that particular pattern\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.\nproject manager: I can't see that, is that play and stop and things?\nuser interface: This is central one, the one you \nproject manager: Or is that volume and channel?\nuser interface: yeah volume and channel. So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models, if you look at all the models, it's here. This and voice recognition.\nproject manager: Okay. Right. Okay. Um I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed. So, we agree on Do we agree on the battery?\nuser interface: The kinetic.\nmarketing: Kinetic?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, that means that there's no function for li the port, you know that it sits in, then pressing the button then having \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think \nproject manager: It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget, it's a\nindustrial designer: I mean if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have\nproject manager: selling point.\nindustrial designer: and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock, then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them. So do you reckon that's a good idea that, where's the remote, I'm here thing? I think that would be quite fun.\nproject manager: I think the only\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: The L_C_D_'s not cheap.\nindustrial designer: Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one,\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: I mean they use them in calculators so.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: Maybe we could start with the black and white.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: That that way we could upgrade later .\nproject manager: And you could yeah. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, we talked about kinetic charging,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: we've deci seem to have decided on that, did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries?\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Well you cou um.\nproject manager: Do you want like a back-up?\nmarketing: No, one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they?\nindustrial designer: K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch.\nmarketing: I oh I see. Right, okay, got you.\nindustrial designer: So it's a lot smaller, so it would \nmarketing: Got you on that okay, didn't realise.\nproject manager: Um, okay so we've got battery. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So there's not a really a decision to be made there, um. The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or \nindustrial designer: Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons,\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: on the on the on on the top one we're gonna\nproject manager: On the top one okay you've got the touch\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: okay and then \nindustrial designer: On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, the anti-R_S_I_ ones.\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nmarketing: Sorry could you repeat that last part?\nindustrial designer: Um, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons.\nmarketing: L_C_D_ screen. Mm-hmm. Okay.\nuser interface: And for the sorry.\nproject manager: No, it's fine.\nuser interface: For the body design I think plastic, uh w yeah\nindustrial designer: Plastic,\nuser interface: we could use the body,\nproject manager: For the inside.\nindustrial designer: okay.\nuser interface: for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip, something like to add to the design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm,\nuser interface: \nmarketing: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs,\nuser interface: Plast right.\nproject manager: Oh I think so, I think so.\nmarketing: okay. and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy, apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed,\nindustrial designer: Mm no.\nproject manager: No I think I \nmarketing: just go for the colours.\nuser interface: It's \nproject manager: we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it um psychedelic, you know, we could make it black and white zebra stripes,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the m you know \nmarketing: The feel.\nproject manager: yes. So we could just pick anything.\nmarketing: 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that, maybe about that size, made of plastic, fits into the palm of the hand, rubberised cover that's spongy. Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted, market research,\nuser interface: Uh I it's different.\nproject manager: It's just different\nmarketing: is that fancy?\nproject manager: it's just different from everything else and I mean, I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: sort of beige and black\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: um so you either want something that goes with that, which is what's on the market anyway,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else, but I mean I totally agree. We looked at those remotes, I mean they are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: This would definitely be different enough, I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more \nproject manager: And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do, you could have um a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little \nmarketing: Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce, that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Right.\nproject manager: And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes {vocalsound}\nmarketing: which is another beauty of it.\nproject manager: y you know, you could just go so far with it,\nindustrial designer: You can you can just \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Acupressure, you could talk of acupressures.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: like a puffer fish, you could just, you could take it wherever,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: so I think that's quite a flexible thing.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: And finally the body should be retouchable, may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside,\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: not the actual uh plastic outside case, just the rubber thing that goes round the outside.\nuser interface: Okay. The rubber.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay we've got five minutes, um, or that might've been up for a while.\nuser interface: Fine.\nmarketing: Mm, so can I just recap uh Sarah,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: for the decisions that we've made, kinetic charging, the watch-type batteries, um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top, rubberised buttons on the bottom side, we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover, the case itself is plastic. That's how far we've got, what else do we have to add to our decisions here?\nuser interface: Fine, uh we were talking of voice recognition also\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So, are we looking at voice?\nmarketing: Yes, it was just, there was just a cost issue with that, but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost,\nuser interface: Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains.\nmarketing: is that right?\nuser interface: For l yeah, the whistle.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, yeah the whistle ones, yeah.\nuser interface: So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle.\nmarketing: And incorporating the company logo?\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Have you \nuser interface: Uh sorry I didn't mention this, but we'll be incorporating in the design.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report, it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product\nproject manager: Well they do,\nmarketing: don't they?\nproject manager: but I think we can you could {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours.\nproject manager: well it is, it is, I think you just address that with um advertising.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, you associate the name with the individual product that it is\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and that does the work for you.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything, but everything else has a logo on it. The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does, without that\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: so I'm not worried about that.\nmarketing: Okay. Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper, I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location, have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then?\nproject manager: Depending on how i {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, depending on the expense of it.\nproject manager: I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into, so\nindustrial designer: And they've got in stock, so yeah.\nproject manager: um that seems to make sense, but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else, then it's worth thinking about. But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Right I'm going to wrap it up there.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Fine.\nproject manager: I got a end meeting now message on my mo\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: yeah\nindustrial designer: Did it?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: so. Um\nuser interface: Again a questionnaire huh?\nproject manager: so I think we've probably got it says, closing we have forty minutes\nmarketing: You got to go through.\nproject manager: so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took .\nuser interface: I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now.\nproject manager: Is everyone happy?

Okay.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Welcome back everybody, hope you've had fun.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: After lunch. Yeah.\nproject manager: Right um this is our conceptual design meeting,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: um I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah I was getting that impression as well.\nproject manager: I th I I think yeah um.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: This is where we talk about um properties, materials, user-interface and trend-watching.\nindustrial designer: Etcetera.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already, but we'll just go over it. Um the minutes from the last time. Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext, it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. Um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition, we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, just a different shape from what's normal, um. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost,\nuser interface: \nproject manager: things like that,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: um and our market was going to be young, business, kind of range.\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Okay, so shall we start with the first presentation?\nmarketing: Shall I?\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Yes if you feel \nmarketing: Okay. We just connect up.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: Thank you. There we go. Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. Um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: sorry Project Manager. Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important, but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, um, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials, uh again in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback there, both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan. Be interesting to see what our design people make of that.\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Okay thank you very much. Um\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: let's start from the inside and work our way out.\nuser interface: Fine. It's okay with me.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay. \nmarketing: Unless anyone has any questions about that?\nproject manager: I don't think so, not yet.\nmarketing: Not yet? 'Kay.\nproject manager: Um, yes, thank you.\nindustrial designer: That screwed in? \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: I hate those little things\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them.\nmarketing: I know.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay, \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay, first uh the Into the method. The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find. Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials, 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available.\nproject manager: 'Kay..\nindustrial designer: Um, findings, I've got my nice little picture there. This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals, based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: There's um actually no rechargeable option available, so we I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment, dynamo charging, I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest,\nproject manager: Wa can you explain that?\nindustrial designer: people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio.\nproject manager: Like a right, okay.\nindustrial designer: So you wind up your remote control before you use it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: How what kind of how l long can you get out of that,\nindustrial designer: It might \nproject manager: I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? Or \nindustrial designer: You Yeah, yeah, oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long, but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options, like the the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_.\nproject manager: That doesn't count though does it?\nmarketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does?\nproject manager: I thought it was U_V_ like \nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Artificial light?\nindustrial designer: Is it? Alright i\nproject manager: Any, any \nmarketing: Has to be solar.\nuser interface: Yep. Regarding those sizes, which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also, so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space.\nindustrial designer: Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up.\nproject manager: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Uh, I don't think it counts electric lights\nmarketing: Mm. Artificial light, no.\nproject manager: no, but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market.\nmarketing: That's going to \nproject manager: I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people, but there are people.\nuser interface: Uh \nmarketing: I know,\nindustrial designer: But \nmarketing: different parts of the world too, if we're if we're marketing internationally.\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nuser interface: Right.\nindustrial designer: and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway.\nuser interface: Night.\nproject manager: Mm, but then it would be charging through the day, I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening.\nindustrial designer: But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches\nproject manager: Yeah I've seen \nindustrial designer: and you d you don't even notice it. I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work.\nuser interface: And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery, it like it runs for long time?\nindustrial designer: Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out .\nuser interface: We c\nproject manager: But then if you think about a watch, it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: so you're walking around, you're doing things, it is moving a lot of the time. If you'd \nindustrial designer: Yeah and \nproject manager: I mean you switch the T_V_ on, then you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but then again\nproject manager: Is it really gonna be enough?\nindustrial designer: I I think it is because if you think about it, the watch, although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And th for the same the same reason, you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it\nproject manager: So it's not the draw on it isn't \nindustrial designer: and you put it \nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be \nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Could I just ask referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with um standard batteries?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: I mean, could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging\nindustrial designer: Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing\nmarketing: or the two things not compatible?\nproject manager: Like a dual kind of.\nindustrial designer: but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because, if you lie  on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical.\nmarketing: Mm. So that affects the exterior design.\nuser interface: Solar would be slightly expensives.\nproject manager: Expensive as well. What kind of price are we looking at for \nindustrial designer: They're they're expensive, they don't \nuser interface: It's twelve point f\nproject manager: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones, um but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping,\nproject manager: Solar.\nindustrial designer: 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y\nproject manager: Well they're not designed \nindustrial designer: the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff, so.\nproject manager: Practical-wise okay.\nindustrial designer: Y I think yeah, practically. I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do,\nproject manager: You do get a bit of wear\nindustrial designer: they can t\nproject manager: but don't calculators have a battery in them as well?\nindustrial designer: Yeah they do, they yeah they've got dual things, but they're the batteries are smaller I think.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Another question is like \nmarketing: Again it de\nuser interface: sorry. W w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: A remote control, like,\nindustrial designer: W m yeah\nuser interface: so we have to s look at the life also.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging, um, I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last.\nmarketing: It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature,\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think i I think it would, yeah.\nmarketing: i it's not gonna add anything, okay.\nproject manager: Okay, can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature?\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Can we think about that? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally \nproject manager: Well add it in to think about um\nmarketing: right, okay.\nproject manager: because, where am I? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less, you you wouldn't lose it so much.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: the eternal battle for control of the controls.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research,\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: it's not a thing that people are looking for\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So \nmarketing: when we threw it open to the field yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe.\nproject manager: Okay, right.\nindustrial designer: Okay, well I'll move on.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um, my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board, which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button, it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts.\nproject manager: What kind of things do we have to consider there? Can we what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of \nindustrial designer: Well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in. If you if you see how thin the tracks are, you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that, or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so that And then to uh yeah, so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off, if we decided to go for buttons that could light up.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um, the case material, I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us, the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical. Titanium um very expensive just to process,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: which to make it is expensive, and rubber, well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year, so perhaps uh some something made of rubber,\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons, because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said. Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape, whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes. But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units\nuser interface: Second thing is \nproject manager: Hinged, yeah.\nindustrial designer: for the flip phone.\nuser interface: yeah and second question is like, a mobile you can change the cover, you call it a skin or whatever.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green, parrot green to chilli red or something like that.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So is that feature available in like uh titanium,\nindustrial designer: Yeah I th\nuser interface: or it's like only specific to plastic or \nindustrial designer: Uh. Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really, the ju just \nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it w well you could make it available in the titanium, it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it, because of the expense of how much titanium is is \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote.\nmarketing: It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall. I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over,\nindustrial designer: Rubber, yeah.\nmarketing: that would give the spongy feel, that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone.\nindustrial designer: And you can peel them off yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber,\nmarketing: Like a rubber sleeve almost, yeah.\nuser interface: Something like \nproject manager: like those pens that you get with the grip, that you can you can pull that off.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: That could be a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: It could it would be comfortable to hold on also.\nproject manager: Okay. Mm.\nindustrial designer: T\nmarketing: Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not.\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Also the \nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons, the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough, that would be one option. Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons, but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space, two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch\nuser interface: Sorry I didn't get the last part, you're talking of \nindustrial designer: display. Uh what what \nuser interface: Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely, you're saying like \nindustrial designer: Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it \nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off, you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_, you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: With W also with the \nmarketing: I don't s sorry to interrupt, I don't see why the curved thing is a problem, if we for example had a shell, once we open that \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Oh it would be flat inside.\nindustrial designer: You could have a flat screen inside, yeah,\nmarketing: yeah, so it'd be f yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside.\nmarketing: Have I misunderstood you?\nindustrial designer: It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but there'd be touch touch buttons,\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em, w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_.\nproject manager: I think it would be good to have a contrast between, if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Is rubber. Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Now how would you distinguish, if you had it bare, how would you distinguish where you had to press, I mean \nindustrial designer: Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest.\nproject manager: Uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I just had another idea, I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the R_S_I_. Is it possible, just as an option, when we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button, or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you could, you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out\nproject manager: Like one of the palm pop thing.\nindustrial designer: but I I think they could get a bit easily lost,\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Absolutely, f for somebody who very often, if he would \nindustrial designer: 'cause I had \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: It would have to be attached.\nmarketing: They're easy to replace as well, cheap.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like, if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah okay.\nmarketing: Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got, couldn't they? A pencil or a pen, so they wouldn't really need a \nproject manager: Okay, we'll talk about that so if you finish your \nindustrial designer: Yeah that's \nproject manager: and we'll come back to that.\nindustrial designer: yeah that that's the end of m my \nproject manager: That's you, right okay.\nuser interface: And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit, since we are hav having a flip-top, we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing, so we can divide the circuit like you know.\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah. Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them,\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking.\nmarketing: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me, it kind of applies to both our designers here, so I'm not sure how it would fit in.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: If we flip open, now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display, you seen those?\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: And they kind of respond to the turn of your body. Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing.\nproject manager: We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women.\nindustrial designer: Um.\nmarketing: They don't look at themselves? Just a thought.\nproject manager: Well it's a remote control, you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. I know what you mean, it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, no, no.\nmarketing: trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: but maybe we'll leave that one on the side.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: I mean you can you could do it, you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out,\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it, I'm not sure about \nmarketing: Oh I think forget about the mirror\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nmarketing: that was just a very quick passing thought yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, uh would like to share something which I did here. First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. Second is we checked into competitors, the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh, people need trendy, they are bored of black and white.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here. No particular remote is standard.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Like, some some people have a Here you see this? This is on a I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control, rest other buttons, they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, and second as already discussed with William, we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: and g graphic user interface\nmarketing: Sorry what does that stand for?\nproject manager: Which means \nuser interface: basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever,\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: which is \nindustrial designer: If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen.\nuser interface: Like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So basically not point or click  Press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device, that means the use of button. So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So we are having a combination of boards, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels.\nproject manager: Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part?\nuser interface: \nproject manager: 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press, just like a mobile phone.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you? Isn't that the idea? You us if we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. That's what I was just saying,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah but you can do it with your thumb li\nuser interface: But \nproject manager: and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and then be able to touch that for the other controls,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Okay and you mean to the \nproject manager: so have the um the volume and the programme, things like that,\nuser interface: And the lower distance.\nproject manager: on the lower side.\nuser interface: Oh f perfect.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nuser interface: So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained, example the volume and channel control buttons. All are confusing and in inconsistent. Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also? And technologically innovative also.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this. My personal preferences would be like, as already uh marketing department, they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, uh red chilli uh\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have, like for example, i if you see the previous slide uh\nindustrial designer: Well, yeah we \nuser interface: I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern, here, so we we we would not change h that particular pattern\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.\nproject manager: I can't see that, is that play and stop and things?\nuser interface: This is central one, the one you \nproject manager: Or is that volume and channel?\nuser interface: yeah volume and channel. So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models, if you look at all the models, it's here. This and voice recognition.\nproject manager: Okay. Right. Okay. Um I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed. So, we agree on Do we agree on the battery?\nuser interface: The kinetic.\nmarketing: Kinetic?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, that means that there's no function for li the port, you know that it sits in, then pressing the button then having \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think \nproject manager: It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget, it's a\nindustrial designer: I mean if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have\nproject manager: selling point.\nindustrial designer: and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock, then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them. So do you reckon that's a good idea that, where's the remote, I'm here thing? I think that would be quite fun.\nproject manager: I think the only\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: The L_C_D_'s not cheap.\nindustrial designer: Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one,\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: I mean they use them in calculators so.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: Maybe we could start with the black and white.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: That that way we could upgrade later .\nproject manager: And you could yeah. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, we talked about kinetic charging,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: we've deci seem to have decided on that, did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries?\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Well you cou um.\nproject manager: Do you want like a back-up?\nmarketing: No, one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they?\nindustrial designer: K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch.\nmarketing: I oh I see. Right, okay, got you.\nindustrial designer: So it's a lot smaller, so it would \nmarketing: Got you on that okay, didn't realise.\nproject manager: Um, okay so we've got battery. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So there's not a really a decision to be made there, um. The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or \nindustrial designer: Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one, on the buttons,\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: on the on the on on the top one we're gonna\nproject manager: On the top one okay you've got the touch\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: okay and then \nindustrial designer: On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, the anti-R_S_I_ ones.\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nmarketing: Sorry could you repeat that last part?\nindustrial designer: Um, okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen, the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons.\nmarketing: L_C_D_ screen. Mm-hmm. Okay.\nuser interface: And for the sorry.\nproject manager: No, it's fine.\nuser interface: For the body design I think plastic, uh w yeah\nindustrial designer: Plastic,\nuser interface: we could use the body,\nproject manager: For the inside.\nindustrial designer: okay.\nuser interface: for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip, something like to add to the design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm,\nuser interface: \nmarketing: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs,\nuser interface: Plast right.\nproject manager: Oh I think so, I think so.\nmarketing: okay. and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy, apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours, we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed,\nindustrial designer: Mm no.\nproject manager: No I think I \nmarketing: just go for the colours.\nuser interface: It's \nproject manager: we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it um psychedelic, you know, we could make it black and white zebra stripes,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on is the m you know \nmarketing: The feel.\nproject manager: yes. So we could just pick anything.\nmarketing: 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that, maybe about that size, made of plastic, fits into the palm of the hand, rubberised cover that's spongy. Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted, market research,\nuser interface: Uh I it's different.\nproject manager: It's just different\nmarketing: is that fancy?\nproject manager: it's just different from everything else and I mean, I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: sort of beige and black\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: um so you either want something that goes with that, which is what's on the market anyway,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else, but I mean I totally agree. We looked at those remotes, I mean they are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: This would definitely be different enough, I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more \nproject manager: And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do, you could have um a plain black one, you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little \nmarketing: Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce, that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Right.\nproject manager: And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes {vocalsound}\nmarketing: which is another beauty of it.\nproject manager: y you know, you could just go so far with it,\nindustrial designer: You can you can just \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Acupressure, you could talk of acupressures.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: like a puffer fish, you could just, you could take it wherever,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: so I think that's quite a flexible thing.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: And finally the body should be retouchable, may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside,\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: not the actual uh plastic outside case, just the rubber thing that goes round the outside.\nuser interface: Okay. The rubber.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay we've got five minutes, um, or that might've been up for a while.\nuser interface: Fine.\nmarketing: Mm, so can I just recap uh Sarah,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: for the decisions that we've made, kinetic charging, the watch-type batteries, um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top, rubberised buttons on the bottom side, we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover, the case itself is plastic. That's how far we've got, what else do we have to add to our decisions here?\nuser interface: Fine, uh we were talking of voice recognition also\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So, are we looking at voice?\nmarketing: Yes, it was just, there was just a cost issue with that, but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost,\nuser interface: Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains.\nmarketing: is that right?\nuser interface: For l yeah, the whistle.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, yeah the whistle ones, yeah.\nuser interface: So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle.\nmarketing: And incorporating the company logo?\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Have you \nuser interface: Uh sorry I didn't mention this, but we'll be incorporating in the design.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report, it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere, they do want it to be obvious that it's our product\nproject manager: Well they do,\nmarketing: don't they?\nproject manager: but I think we can you could {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours.\nproject manager: well it is, it is, I think you just address that with um advertising.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, you associate the name with the individual product that it is\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and that does the work for you.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything, but everything else has a logo on it. The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does, without that\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: so I'm not worried about that.\nmarketing: Okay. Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper, I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location, have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then?\nproject manager: Depending on how i {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, depending on the expense of it.\nproject manager: I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into, so\nindustrial designer: And they've got in stock, so yeah.\nproject manager: um that seems to make sense, but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else, then it's worth thinking about. But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Right I'm going to wrap it up there.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Fine.\nproject manager: I got a end meeting now message on my mo\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: yeah\nindustrial designer: Did it?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: so. Um\nuser interface: Again a questionnaire huh?\nproject manager: so I think we've probably got it says, closing we have forty minutes\nmarketing: You got to go through.\nproject manager: so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took .\nuser interface: I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now.\nproject manager: Is everyone happy?

Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, and of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, is twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important, but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, um, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there, that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials, uh again in contrast to last year.

Or \nindustrial designer: You Yeah, yeah, oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long, but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options, like the the solar charging, 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_.\nproject manager: That doesn't count though does it?\nmarketing: Does does light charge as as sunlight does?\nproject manager: I thought it was U_V_ like \nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Artificial light?\nindustrial designer: Is it? Alright i\nproject manager: Any, any \nmarketing: Has to be solar.\nuser interface: Yep. Regarding those sizes, which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also, so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space.\nindustrial designer: Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up.\nproject manager: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Uh, I don't think it counts electric lights\nmarketing: Mm.

I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up, I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work.\nuser interface: And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery, it like it runs for long time?\nindustrial designer: Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out .\nuser interface: We c\nproject manager: But then if you think about a watch, it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: so you're walking around, you're doing things, it is moving a lot of the time. If you'd \nindustrial designer: Yeah and \nproject manager: I mean you switch the T_V_ on, then you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but then again\nproject manager: Is it really gonna be enough?\nindustrial designer: I I think it is because if you think about it, the watch, although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And th for the same the same reason, you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it\nproject manager: So it's not the draw on it isn't \nindustrial designer: and you put it \nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be \nmarketing: Mm-hmm.

So that affects the exterior design.\nuser interface: Solar would be slightly expensives.\nproject manager: Expensive as well. What kind of price are we looking at for \nindustrial designer: They're they're expensive, they don't \nuser interface: It's twelve point f\nproject manager: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones, um but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping,\nproject manager: Solar.\nindustrial designer: 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y\nproject manager: Well they're not designed \nindustrial designer: the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff, so.\nproject manager: Practical-wise okay.\nindustrial designer: Y I think yeah, practically. I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do,\nproject manager: You do get a bit of wear\nindustrial designer: they can t\nproject manager: but don't calculators have a battery in them as well?\nindustrial designer: Yeah they do, they yeah they've got dual things, but they're the batteries are smaller I think.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Another question is like \nmarketing: Again it de\nuser interface: sorry.

'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally \nproject manager: Well add it in to think about um\nmarketing: right, okay.\nproject manager: because, where am I? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less, you you wouldn't lose it so much.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: the eternal battle for control of the controls.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research,\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: it's not a thing that people are looking for\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So \nmarketing: when we threw it open to the field yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe.\nindustrial designer: so that And then to uh yeah, so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off, if we decided to go for buttons that could light up.\nuser interface: Okay.", "en_query": "What are the benefits and drawbacks for each battery option mentioned and what did Industrial Manager suggest to conserve battery life when discussing the design and availability of actual components?", "zh_query": "在讨论实际组件的设计与实现方案时，所提及的各电池选项存在哪些优缺点，以及产品经理建议如何延长电池寿命？", "fr_query": "Quels sont les avantages et les inconvénients de chaque option de batterie mentionnée et qu'a suggéré le directeur industriel pour préserver la durée de vie de la batterie lors de la discussion sur la conception et la disponibilité des composants réels ?", "ukr_query": "Які переваги та недоліки є у кожній згаданій батареї та що запропонував промисловий менеджер для збереження терміну служби батареї під час обговорення проекту та доступності наявних складових?", "en_summary": "Standard AA and AAA are bulky but the cheapest.

So that affects the exterior design.\nuser interface: Solar would be slightly expensives.\nproject manager: Expensive as well. What kind of price are we looking at for \nindustrial designer: They're they're expensive, they don't \nuser interface: It's twelve point f\nproject manager: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones, um but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping,\nproject manager: Solar.\nindustrial designer: 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y\nproject manager: Well they're not designed \nindustrial designer: the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff, so.\nproject manager: Practical-wise okay.\nindustrial designer: Y I think yeah, practically. I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do,\nproject manager: You do get a bit of wear\nindustrial designer: they can t\nproject manager: but don't calculators have a battery in them as well?\nindustrial designer: Yeah they do, they yeah they've got dual things, but they're the batteries are smaller I think.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Another question is like \nmarketing: Again it de\nuser interface: sorry. W w which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: A remote control, like,\nindustrial designer: W m yeah\nuser interface: so we have to s look at the life also.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging, um, I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last.\nmarketing: It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature,\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think i I think it would, yeah.\nmarketing: i it's not gonna add anything, okay.\nproject manager: Okay, can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature?\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Can we think about that? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally \nproject manager: Well add it in to think about um\nmarketing: right, okay.\nproject manager: because, where am I? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less, you you wouldn't lose it so much.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: the eternal battle for control of the controls.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research,\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: it's not a thing that people are looking for\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So \nmarketing: when we threw it open to the field yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe.\nproject manager: Okay, right.\nindustrial designer: Okay, well I'll move on.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um, my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board, which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button, it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts.\nproject manager: What kind of things do we have to consider there? Can we what kind of size, does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of \nindustrial designer: Well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in. If you if you see how thin the tracks are, you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that, or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so that And then to uh yeah, so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off, if we decided to go for buttons that could light up.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um, the case material, I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us, the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical. Titanium um very expensive just to process,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: which to make it is expensive, and rubber, well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year, so perhaps uh some something made of rubber,\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons, because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said. Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape, whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes. But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units\nuser interface: Second thing is \nproject manager: Hinged, yeah.\nindustrial designer: for the flip phone.\nuser interface: yeah and second question is like, a mobile you can change the cover, you call it a skin or whatever.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green, parrot green to chilli red or something like that.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So is that feature available in like uh titanium,\nindustrial designer: Yeah I th\nuser interface: or it's like only specific to plastic or \nindustrial designer: Uh. Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really, the ju just \nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it w well you could make it available in the titanium, it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it, because of the expense of how much titanium is is \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote.\nmarketing: It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall. I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over,\nindustrial designer: Rubber, yeah.\nmarketing: that would give the spongy feel, that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone.\nindustrial designer: And you can peel them off yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber,\nmarketing: Like a rubber sleeve almost, yeah.\nuser interface: Something like \nproject manager: like those pens that you get with the grip, that you can you can pull that off.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: That could be a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: It could it would be comfortable to hold on also.\nproject manager: Okay. Mm.\nindustrial designer: T\nmarketing: Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not.\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Also the \nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons, the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough, that would be one option. Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons, but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space, two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch\nuser interface: Sorry I didn't get the last part, you're talking of \nindustrial designer: display. Uh what what \nuser interface: Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely, you're saying like \nindustrial designer: Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it \nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off, you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_, you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: With W also with the \nmarketing: I don't s sorry to interrupt, I don't see why the curved thing is a problem, if we for example had a shell, once we open that \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Oh it would be flat inside.\nindustrial designer: You could have a flat screen inside, yeah,\nmarketing: yeah, so it'd be f yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside.\nmarketing: Have I misunderstood you?\nindustrial designer: It wouldn't be like full colour, it would just be black and white,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: but there'd be touch touch buttons,\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em, w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_.\nproject manager: I think it would be good to have a contrast between, if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Is rubber. Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Now how would you distinguish, if you had it bare, how would you distinguish where you had to press, I mean \nindustrial designer: Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest.\nproject manager: Uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I just had another idea, I don't know if it helps with that, but just to do with the R_S_I_. Is it possible, just as an option, when we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button, or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you could, you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out\nproject manager: Like one of the palm pop thing.\nindustrial designer: but I I think they could get a bit easily lost,\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Absolutely, f for somebody who very often, if he would \nindustrial designer: 'cause I had \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: It would have to be attached.\nmarketing: They're easy to replace as well, cheap.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like, if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah okay.\nmarketing: Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got, couldn't they? A pencil or a pen, so they wouldn't really need a \nproject manager: Okay, we'll talk about that so if you finish your \nindustrial designer: Yeah that's \nproject manager: and we'll come back to that.\nindustrial designer: yeah that that's the end of m my \nproject manager: That's you, right okay.\nuser interface: And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit, since we are hav having a flip-top, we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing, so we can divide the circuit like you know.\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah. Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them,\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking.\nmarketing: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me, it kind of applies to both our designers here, so I'm not sure how it would fit in.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: If we flip open, now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display, you seen those?\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: And they kind of respond to the turn of your body. Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing.\nproject manager: We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women.\nindustrial designer: Um.\nmarketing: They don't look at themselves? Just a thought.\nproject manager: Well it's a remote control, you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. I know what you mean, it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, no, no.\nmarketing: trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: but maybe we'll leave that one on the side.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: I mean you can you could do it, you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out,\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it, I'm not sure about \nmarketing: Oh I think forget about the mirror\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nmarketing: that was just a very quick passing thought yeah.", "en_query": "Summarize the design and availability of actual components.", "zh_query": "总结实际组件的设计和实现方案。", "fr_query": "Résumez la conception et la disponibilité des composants réels.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте проект і наявність складових.", "en_summary": "The chip TA11835 and PCB board will be used in the device.

{"fname": "product_test_26", "dialogue": "user interface: Okay, uh would like to share something which I did here. First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design, to check on the customer needs and feasibility. Second is we checked into competitors, the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh, people need trendy, they are bored of black and white.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here. No particular remote is standard.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Like, some some people have a Here you see this? This is on a I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control, rest other buttons, they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, and second as already discussed with William, we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: and g graphic user interface\nmarketing: Sorry what does that stand for?\nproject manager: Which means \nuser interface: basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever,\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: which is \nindustrial designer: If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen.\nuser interface: Like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So basically not point or click  Press any particular device, he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device, that means the use of button. So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So we are having a combination of boards, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels.\nproject manager: Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part?\nuser interface: \nproject manager: 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press, just like a mobile phone.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you? Isn't that the idea? You us if we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. That's what I was just saying,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah but you can do it with your thumb li\nuser interface: But \nproject manager: and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and then be able to touch that for the other controls,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Okay and you mean to the \nproject manager: so have the um the volume and the programme, things like that,\nuser interface: And the lower distance.\nproject manager: on the lower side.\nuser interface: Oh f perfect.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nuser interface: So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained, example the volume and channel control buttons. All are confusing and in inconsistent. Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it could be like, where is the remote, and the remote answers I am here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also? And technologically innovative also.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this. My personal preferences would be like, as already uh marketing department, they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, uh red chilli uh\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have, like for example, i if you see the previous slide uh\nindustrial designer: Well, yeah we \nuser interface: I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern, here, so we we we would not change h that particular pattern\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.\nproject manager: I can't see that, is that play and stop and things?\nuser interface: This is central one, the one you \nproject manager: Or is that volume and channel?\nuser interface: yeah volume and channel. So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models, if you look at all the models, it's here. This and voice recognition.\nproject manager: Okay. Right. Okay. Um I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed. So, we agree on Do we agree on the battery?\nuser interface: The kinetic.\nmarketing: Kinetic?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, that means that there's no function for li the port, you know that it sits in, then pressing the button then having \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think \nproject manager: It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget, it's a\nindustrial designer: I mean if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have\nproject manager: selling point.\nindustrial designer: and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock, then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them,", "en_query": "What are the designs of normal remotes and how can the new remote be different from the normal ones?", "zh_query": "普通遥控器的设计是什么样的？新遥控器与常见遥控器有什么不同？", "fr_query": "Quelles sont les conceptions des télécommandes normales et comment la nouvelle télécommande peut-elle être différente des télécommandes normales ?", "ukr_query": "Який дизайн мають звичайні пульти і чим новий пульт відрізнятиметься від звичайних?", "en_summary": "Mostly black and white colours, the normal ones are monotonous without consistency between models, and the buttons are very disorganized.

Record. So the project method is the following. So if we're um the functional design, you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other. Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design. Uh.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The tool training is to try out the white board, so \nindustrial designer: Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe you can draw your favourite animal\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and make a list of its favourite characteristics.\nmarketing: So right now?\nproject manager: I don't know if we have to do it now, maybe later later.\nuser interface: So yeah I think you can do it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I don't know.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Twenty five Euros?\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: I think it's quite good price, yeah.\nindustrial designer: I it's it's reasonable, s quite yeah. Twenty five.\nmarketing: It's reasonable, I think, yeah.\nproject manager: And uh\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it will uh be a an international remote control,\nindustrial designer: Is \nproject manager: as we want to sell it in the entire world, and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes. So, as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control. Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: try to create something new and people would like to to buy. And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes, so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I I hope so {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications.\nmarketing: Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think. AMI\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: and \nproject manager: I_D_,\nmarketing: okay.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: I_D_ is for the Industrial Design, yeah?\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And U_I_D_, it's for the User Interface Designer,\nuser interface: That's me.\nmarketing: Okay,\nindustrial designer: yeah?\nmarketing: and Marketing Expert, it's me.\nindustrial designer: AMI yeah project.\nproject manager: So I will manage all all the group.\nindustrial designer: you will be the manager yeah {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You can manage all this, yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Good.\nproject manager: So you have questions?\nmarketing: Um. Not really.\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: you all know what the parts of the work you have to do.\nmarketing: So which you, the Industrial Designer.\nuser interface: No I'm user interf I'm user interface design.\nindustrial designer: I am the Industrial Design, yeah\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: And you?\nindustrial designer: I am the Industrial Designer so.\nproject manager: Mm okay.\nuser interface: Okay. So what's the difference between\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: user interface design d industrial design? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Hmm.\nmarketing: I mean, you have to know. Ah, you have to know it.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's difficult. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's your job, so I hope you you know what it is.\nindustrial designer: You know very soon. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, I think so.\nindustrial designer: So \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it.\nuser interface: Okay, so I make uh u user interface.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: You you de you implement the core functions in the \nproject manager: And i maybe you will transform it.\nindustrial designer: I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so \nuser interface: Use it. Make make yeah.\nindustrial designer: And the uh industrial design, it is how the object will look like.\nuser interface: Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh, it's the function design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. So the materi\nuser interface: I design the user f user interface, you design the function.\nproject manager: Maybe, it is the outside and the inside.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay right. But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I don't know. Okay.\nmarketing: Well. You know.\nindustrial designer: I'm the industrial designer.\nmarketing: Oh, okay, okay. Not the other one.\nindustrial designer: So.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay. So and the marketing expert will \nmarketing: Yeah, I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have\nproject manager: And \nmarketing: and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Ok Okay.\nproject manager: And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product. So you don't have to do something really specific,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: as everybody everybody will have to use it,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: it's sor the same as keyboards. You know, you have Qwerty, Azerty, French and U_K_ keyboard,\nuser interface: Yeah. Mm.\nproject manager: so really the remote control to be international.\nuser interface: Yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: And not too expensive.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah. And uh simple.\nproject manager: As we want to maximise the benefit.\nuser interface: And easy to use.\nmarketing: And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty, so.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros.\nuser interface: Ah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: It should be \nmarketing: That's the problem.\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, is it okay?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm. It's clear.\nindustrial designer: There was a step about drawing something in the in the board, I don't know.\nmarketing: Yeah, maybe should go and draw an animal.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is it? Are we supposed to do right now? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah yeah, you try. Try first. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you think we have to do it now?\nindustrial designer: I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You can draw something which is very simple. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You want me to draw something?\nindustrial designer: Oh \nproject manager: Product manager \nindustrial designer: Everybody {vocalsound}\nproject manager: okay, let's go,\nuser interface: Oh, maybe we should bring Kemy here.\nproject manager: I will try.\nuser interface: Kemy is really good at drawing. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Many \nindustrial designer: I think everybody should do it, so.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's not matter So.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You're going to draw? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Uh it's the same as mine.\nuser interface: What's this?\nindustrial designer: yeah.

Sorry.\nuser interface: Uh let's see. Which one was mine?\nproject manager: So let's have a look, we have forty minutes, so it's it's more than enough. Okay, perfect. So we have Oh no, what's that? So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting, and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure, that we are,\nuser interface: Good.\nproject manager: that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like. Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting, so I showed uh show them to you. Oh, sorry about that, I just escape this one. How do I escape this? How do I I escape this s uh presentation?\nindustrial designer: What?\nuser interface: Uh left.\nindustrial designer: Uh \nproject manager: Ah okay.\nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: Just Yeah.\nproject manager: And show, sorry. Okay, so let's have a look s at this one. Okay, so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um Should be a univ uh universal remote control No, that's I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only. So have you changed that part?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so yeah, it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly. It's it's still the same. Um All these points uh we have to look at. You all know them. But uh there's another point. The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people. So they're old and not younger people. So we have to look at that as well. 'Specially old people, maybe bi bigger buttons or something, I dunno.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Uh so So yeah, that's it, so just you can do your presentation for uh \nuser interface: Which one first?\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Oh it doesn't matter, just start with the \nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm. Uh \nuser interface: Functional requirements, yeah\nmarketing: Okay. Well my name is Jens Damman, but we're in a group, and I I will start it. Wait. Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site. Uh I think you've uh read it too. Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site.\nproject manager: I I didn't read i read it, so it's not for me,\nmarketing: You didn't read it?\nproject manager: I didn't get it uh anyway.\nuser interface: No, I didn don't thing we got it.\nproject manager: It's only for you.\nmarketing: Oh okay, I I was the only one who get it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users. And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof. So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings. So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control. Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly. Yeah, I think uh uh that's a lot, so we have to make a beautiful remote control. Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy. I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people. Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good. Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at. Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot. Well okay, that's uh normal. I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons. But that's one of our requirements.\nproject manager: The last point is quite an interesting {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: Um Martijn alr already said it.\nproject manager: if we Yeah.\nmarketing: And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one, but I don't think it's uh\nproject manager: Yeah, we should have the ten percent on the on the top,\nmarketing: reachable.\nproject manager: then you're you're \nmarketing: Yeah, the ten percent on the top, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That that's a good one. Um uh page two. Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something. Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system, so when you clap your hands it will beep or something. Uh you must find it uh quickly.\nuser interface: Uh. Maybe just a button on the home station. So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station.\nmarketing: Okay, yeah. Yeah, we can uh combine that. Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control. Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this. It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent. But it's uh a tough one. Because if we make a ha whole new product, our own style, we we c uh this is so difficult, uh a difficulty I think. Uh next, remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. Yeah, but only if they zap a lot, and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something. I don't We we haven't Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point. Okay, last page.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets, like uh speech recognition. We didn't uh think about that already. And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control. We already thought about that. Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features. And but they're more critical. And older people uh want to spend uh more money. But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features, because they're in their old uh thinking way. And they want to keep the old uh things the old things. \nproject manager: So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus.\nmarketing: But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients?\nproject manager: People. So yeah, so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control,\nmarketing: I I think we can speak, uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: because Yeah.\nmarketing: because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros.\nproject manager: It's too Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um then I have my personal uh preference. Okay, that's not very good, because I thought about television, D_V_D_ player, stereo and V_C_R_. I had a question about. But it's already out of the question, this. Um my point is, well, I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television, I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros. But it's the exercise.\nproject manager: Because it's too expensive. Yeah, probably.\nmarketing: Yeah, only only for television uh On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything. And we only make it for television, so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special.\nuser interface: Yeah, but good usability, so you can use it.\nmarketing: Okay, I told about the home station. Uh it must be simple, because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it. And I I found a motto. And we put the fashion in electronics. And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style. We we have to make a a new product. We have to be um Yeah. One of a kind, I think.\nproject manager: So it has to look uh uh uh unique,\nuser interface: Unique.\nmarketing: The company is about our uh th th their own fashion, their own style.\nproject manager: but Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I reckon \nproject manager: But old people are not looking for that.\nuser interface: Uh I think mm \nproject manager: Not really.\nuser interface: Uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah. I think the main thing is the usability, that's where we can uh make it a special product.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah.\nmarketing: to k to keep it simple when you \nuser interface: But uh we also have to stand out,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Sorry I thought about it, yes.\nuser interface: 'cause there are already, like you said, so many controls out that support lot of stuff. But we have to make sure that we're better usability, and stand out by just looks of it. So make it just a different colour or different shape,\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay.\nuser interface: so \nmarketing: Okay, this was uh my presentation.\nproject manager: Thanks.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: I don't \nproject manager: So\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Paul, you can do the next one if you want.\nmarketing: You can ask some questions or something.\nuser interface: Okay. Yeah well Uh.\nproject manager: It's on the on the uh net net uh thing,\nuser interface: There it is.\nproject manager: isn't it?\nuser interface: Okay. Technical functions design. Okay, well, so we have s mm uh broad audience. Isn't that isn't true anymore. But um we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple. Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard. So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls. Not too full, like uh Jens already said, only ten percent is being used.\nproject manager: So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or \nuser interface: Yeah, I have it on the next page.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff. Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use, and 'cause you have more room then, and for elderly people big buttons. Uh an icon on it or text on it, so it's very clear what that buttons does. So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it. Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people, elderly people what they use, what they want on a remote control\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: to find out. But there is already in a one done. Of functions I could think of. Uh volume, channels, the the basic according to . Just one two three etcetera. Uh text service options. Um basic on-off. And I found an uh Could I think of favourites? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: But if you could make a new option, that you just have to press one button and you get on your \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel. So you might as well remember the number. Or not?\nproject manager: Maybe i maybe it's too complicated,\nuser interface: No y\nproject manager: but not sure .\nuser interface: Well\nproject manager: It's a good idea, but \nuser interface: it's It was just a thought. So I'm, I u I would find it handy, I think, when you just press one button and you get on six six six.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay. But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button?\nuser interface: Well uh\nproject manager: Uh \nuser interface: what I was reading on the page. Uh a remote control just sends commands, basics commands to uh the television. So switch to channel six.\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nuser interface: So uh button six says says six. And if you make favourites, it can say six six six in a row. Just numbers. That can be in the in the \nindustrial designer: Yeah okay. But uh uh for a user to to remember, if I press that button it goes to that channel.\nuser interface: Well if you said a favourite \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but isn't it hard to remember? Like favourite one and \nproject manager: Uh mayb for me it's \nuser interface: Well i\nproject manager: If I use my telephone, I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never.\nuser interface: Never? Oh.\nindustrial designer: No, neither do I.\nproject manager: So \nuser interface: Oh are you?\nproject manager: And \nuser interface: Okay now, m maybe not.\nproject manager: If I don't do it, maybe old people {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, maybe elderly people uh. Right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I dunno.\nuser interface: They don't like new features. So maybe not.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um well play, pause. I dunno if that's usable\nproject manager: It's not, it's still not It's not anymore n uh \nuser interface: when Not anymore for T_V_.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Right, on off. I dunno, miss Did I miss any other buttons, basic buttons? I couldn't think of any other,'specially not for T_V_.\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: Just on the front as well. No, that's the only th the only thing you need.\nuser interface: Is \nindustrial designer: Uh uh the p uh next and previous. Previous I know, but next channel?\nuser interface: Just the channel um uh What I mean is uh \nindustrial designer: I don't thi\nmarketing: Forward.\nindustrial designer: Li like a web browser,\nuser interface: Six seven eight or five.\nindustrial designer: so Oh, okay.\nproject manager: Just very simple.\nindustrial designer: But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before. Like a web browser back button.\nuser interface: Um I dunno.\nproject manager: Uh Yeah,\nuser interface: I don't have Uh I did \nproject manager: I know what it is, but I think it's all too difficult for old people. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah,\nmarketing: No. Uh \nuser interface: I don't think you use that. Y only when you want to go to \nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time.\nproject manager: And how do you want to uh do it, like if you have a channel above ten?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Normally you can press one, zero or \nuser interface: Yeah, I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons. So you have that uh \nproject manager: A ten plus or \nuser interface: Yeah, the ten plus button. Just uh one one pressing, or quickly after each other.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: To just keep it simple and standard uh features.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough. Maybe the elderly people \nuser interface: Uh yeah mayb\nmarketing: It gets some seconds.\nuser interface: But I think that's in the T_V_ as well. That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it. But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's it's no it's not a \nuser interface: So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but that's th mm \nmarketing: It's what Paul says. It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two. It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: So if you have a universal T_V_ controller, you needed one button that has two uh stripes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So we have a a period of, I dunno, five seconds to press those buttons, and that And not for elderly people to look, one two uh press and aim and \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: But do we still need a two level remote control? Because if we only have that l only f\nmarketing: It's only for television now.\nuser interface: So I I don't think so.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: Uh I just thought of another one.\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So you also need a menu button. And then uh navigation uh But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: so you have\nindustrial designer: I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use, like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things, and uh the menu button.\nuser interface: four arrows.\nindustrial designer: Because you n almost never use menu button.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay,\nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: but um \nproject manager: Maybe it's still still a good idea, I'm not sure. You'll also have to use a mute button to to \nuser interface: Yeah, a mute button. Yes.\nproject manager: Maybe, not \nuser interface: Don't think so.\nproject manager: I don't know where where you have to put it.\nuser interface: Yeah well,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that's that's I think that's the layers that produce. Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on. What we're gonna use.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's right.\nuser interface: And later we can d uh do the design.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, uh now my personal preferences. Uh using the standards, basic Um I think that we should stand out uh unique, being unique with the design. So we have to, I dunno, uh make a different shape than usual. So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging, that it stands out. Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls.\nproject manager: Yeah. Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours\nuser interface: Um I dunno. Different colours um \nproject manager: or \nmarketing: Maybe we can give it out in different colours. You can choose blue or yellow\nproject manager: It's like a iMac or something.\nmarketing: or \nproject manager: Just to make it {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well why not? Or Yeah.\nmarketing: That's fa That's fancy. That's uh fashion.\nproject manager: But it looks cheap as well, because it's a small thing. It's only twenty five Euros. It looks very cheap if you make it \nuser interface: Well, maybe you can look at uh mobile phones.\nproject manager: Oh, you just I dunno what happened.\nuser interface: Oh.\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Who?\nproject manager: Yeah, we have to look at mobile phones, that's right. Just \nuser interface: They they're uh designed very well.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And well basically are the same, just a bit smaller. You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small, 'cause then you will always lo always lose it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But uh well, I think that's a good example.\nproject manager: Okay, \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: we hurry up a bit, because otherwise we won't make it.\nuser interface: Okay, sorry.\nproject manager: Is it fin Are you finished?\nuser interface: Well uh \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, I I'm finished. I think we discussed everything.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Well, the working design. The method I used is uh search the web. Just the web page provided. Um Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated, but uh I could figure it out. Um basically what happens is you press a button, uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button, uh like a switch. And by closing that certain circuit, the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed. So like you press a one, that circuit is closed and uh Then the chip produces a pattern. Like a Morse code to uh And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_. That's the uh light emitting diode, I think. Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light. That's un uh invisible to the human eye. And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_. However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it. And that's uh another diode, I believe.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Because infrared is not visible. So that's er uh do two different things\nproject manager: So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it?\nindustrial designer: but Yeah. I I think so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh j Is \nindustrial designer: I I'm not sure if it's the same thing.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's I think it's usable.\nuser interface: Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting?\nmarketing: Yeah, that's active.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Or just a green one,\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: because it's If you use it, it's green or the red, it's r green.\nuser interface: Yeah. Maybe uh \nmarketing: I I think it's in the case that it's active. It's not uh \nproject manager: Yeah, that's right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, when you press it.\nproject manager: But if you \nindustrial designer: So \nmarketing: I it's it's just uh the the \nproject manager: Red's l shows up like something's wrong,\nindustrial designer: Two?\nproject manager: and green is like it's okay, you press the button.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I dunno.\nuser interface: Maybe depends on uh \nindustrial designer: Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red.\nproject manager: Yeah, I know.\nuser interface: Yes.\nindustrial designer: So \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, we make it red.\nuser interface: But maybe \nindustrial designer: So\nuser interface: Well\nindustrial designer: I know.\nuser interface: we don't have to make it red. Maybe integrate it in the design as well.\nproject manager: You have to The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons. Uh that's cool. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I I think uh the batteries will be uh a little \nuser interface: Uh Oh,\nmarketing: Empty.\nuser interface: maybe it's it is would an e No. Just uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No, we have a recharger in it, so \nuser interface: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: If we can still make that then {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh maybe.\nuser interface: Yeah, but it doesn't have to be red.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's just to indicate something's on.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. That it's working. That it's not not the batteries are low.\nproject manager: But it's cool if it was green.\nuser interface: Yeah. It's it's not very important,\nproject manager: Green or red or whatever, it is cool. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I know. Just to indicate it's working.\nuser interface: So mm \nindustrial designer: And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern. So we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal. So that it can be used with all the T_V_s. We have to really understand what patterns are used, so we can uh o On the Otherwise it won't work.\nuser interface: So we have to uh make buttons for that as well, to make it uh \nindustrial designer: No. I I uh The chip um uh is producing the pattern. So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to \nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: An automatically search function for each television, or something.\nindustrial designer: That are working. Yeah, or I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works. It wasn't explained there.\nuser interface: Well, I I use a universal uh remote control,\nmarketing: Uh I kno\nuser interface: and list of all the T_V_s you have, etcetera. And you have to put in a number, so it works on your T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah? Okay.\nmarketing: Oh, I have a modern one.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And the modern one you you uh you type uh search, and the LED began to blink blink blink. And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off. And then you know, oh it it's the right one. And you can stop it,\nindustrial designer: Ah okay.\nmarketing: and then it's okay. So you don't have to search for your television or your code.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: It uh search uh the pattern for itself.\nuser interface: Okay,\nindustrial designer: Okay, yeah.\nuser interface: so we use that.\nindustrial designer: So it uh We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one. Because you have to \nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: I just say Can you s just say it again, because I was just looking There's just a short \nindustrial designer: Uh okay. Well uh y you have this chip.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's uh when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different. So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one. And on the other T_V_ it won't work, basically. So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah, changing this pattern all the time.\nmarketing: Changing the signal.\nindustrial designer: And um What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern, this chip, uh is trying to switch off the television. And when it's uh switched off, you can push a button as uh it's working now, so And then he saves that setting\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and then um it's working.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's the right uh option.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Well uh the components.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's a bit technical, and I hadn't I w I was a little short on time. Um but I think I understand it. Um the energy source is uh the battery, basically.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um that's connecting to all the components.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Because it has to be fed with energy. Okay. Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed. So basically when you press a button, a switch get closed. Um that's connecting to a chip. So the chip knows what button you pressed. And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb. I didn didn't put the description by this one. Th this is a normal bulb. So the normal flashing light.\nproject manager: Okay. So that's the LED, L_E_D_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, and this is a LED too.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: But this one is producing infrared light\nproject manager: Yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: that's invisible. And this one is producing normal light.\nproject manager: So we can make the normal one also a normal light. Not a LED light, but as a normal one. To flash up your {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah \nmarketing: Uh if you if you use the buttons, uh both of them works. But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, presu Yeah yeah yeah. Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work, it can Basically if the battery is low, it won't work.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah, and \nproject manager: Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push. So you see green if you push that button.\nindustrial designer: Huh, that's a good idea.\nmarketing: Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then.\nproject manager: Yeah, but if you u if you do that, you know that you're uh sending a signal.\nuser interface: No, y Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: And it's you also know which button you p\nmarketing: But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's right. But it \nmarketing: Everywhere in the r\nproject manager: But does it make any difference for the energy you use? You got still one LED.\nuser interface: No I don't think so, but Yeah, i it it will look different, and I think we need to find something else.\nproject manager: That looks different, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard, and our uh motto also is \nmarketing: Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons?\nuser interface: Yeah, w around the buttons, or in the buttons even.\nmarketing: Yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but mm like when you push it\nuser interface: Yeah, then then won't Then you won't see it.\nindustrial designer: n n Yeah. You have your finger over the button. So you can see \nmarketing: It must be around it then.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing\nmarketing: Yeah, then \nindustrial designer: or \nmarketing: Yeah. Not not not not here, but here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. There. Yeah.\nmarketing: Maybe uh \nproject manager: The same as a telephone, or a mobile phone, or what do you mean?\nuser interface: Yeah, we're thinking about it.\nproject manager: If you push \nuser interface: Uh on a mobile phone, in the dark uh\nproject manager: It lights up. Everything lights up. That's a good idea.\nuser interface: everything lights up. Why ain't that on a remote control?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much.\nuser interface: Yeah, if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it, it's \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: It's f Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well.\nuser interface: Yeah, i if you're in the dark, you can't see the remote.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: It's only few LEDs. Only four or something. Four LED.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: No, I dunno. But if we use a battery station, which I think we will use \nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: Yeah, that's a good idea, okay.\nmarketing: I uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah. We'll have enough power\nproject manager: Everything agre\nindustrial designer: to \nproject manager: Everyone agrees with that, or Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Maybe what Paul said, uh under the on the on the home station, uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control, that it beeps.\nproject manager: Yeah, and then you Okay, yeah. But you have to make a sound device in it then.\nuser interface: And also it's \nmarketing: Yeah, there must be sound in it.\nproject manager: But \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay, it shouldn't take much \nmarketing: I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make. Especially for that kind of money. Because it's i it has to be \nmarketing: Mm uh, twenty five Euros, I think we can make it.\nuser interface: Uh I th\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half.\nmarketing: Bec Twelve and a half, okay. But but we only have to make it for television, and um we must have something special.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: I think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options.\nmarketing: So \nuser interface: But we lose about ninety percent of those options. So I think you can uh \nmarketing: Uh. We have to give our customers some extras.\nuser interface: Yeah. I think we will save money with that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Okay. Are you almost finished or just \nindustrial designer: Yeah, the the personal preference, I didn't fill it out.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Because I was short on time.\nproject manager: No worry.\nindustrial designer: But um Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration.\nproject manager: Yeah, I just want to talk some about some more. So maybe you have to Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So this Oh, sorry. Wh what's that? So uh Oh, sorry. We have some new uh project requirements. We have to have a look what they are. They're still in um Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet. So a teletext option, maybe we have to skip that one. I'm not sure. I don't think so,\nindustrial designer: No,\nproject manager: but \nindustrial designer: and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext, still use.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Yeah, and it's it's on your comp it's on your television. It's only one button. So I don't think it is \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh.\nproject manager: We definitely should use it. Um \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's uh what I told you. The remote control should only be used for a television. So that's maybe easier. And um the the forty plus people, I already told you. Oh no, sorry. Oh, this is a problem. Oh sorry about that. The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. So it should be flashy or just more interesting.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Oh. Mm.\nuser interface: Okay, that's It changes things.\nproject manager: I'm sorry about that. I just I just didn't read it well.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So does it make some decision about that? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Changes.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um \nindustrial designer: That kinda changes the whole situation.\nmarketing: Uh \nuser interface: Well yeah, then we have to make some nice features. I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way,\nproject manager: That still stays.\nuser interface: to make it more like a mobile phone. More modern.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: That's important I think and \nmarketing: L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think.\nuser interface: And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control, especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it.\nmarketing: Oh.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: Mm ah I I don't y you'll use it often, because you can see on the television wh what channel you \nmarketing: Oh, I'm watching uh the channel one. Okay. No, it's not \nuser interface: Yeah, I tho I think that's not usable.\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: So, but uh Yeah. What other features can we put in?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular. And uh then the usability is not that required, because the Like in the mobile phones, usability is not that good I think.\nmarketing: But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition. About you said one and the television turns on one. Is that reachable maybe?\nindustrial designer: I didn't read \nmarketing: That's very That's fancy. That's cool.\nuser interface: It's very fashion.\nindustrial designer: I didn't read any\nmarketing: Twelve and you've got twelve.\nindustrial designer: b Yeah. Yeah okay.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: I I know.\nmarketing: Only the numbers, only numbers. Uh furthermore nothing. But only the numbers, one to twenty or something.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: That should be cool.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well. If it's possible. But \nmarketing: If it's possible,\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: I don't think it's very expensive actually.\nindustrial designer: I don't know.\nmarketing: I dunno. I didn't read it.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Why should it?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's \nmarketing: Uh if i if i\nproject manager: You only have a microphone in it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I didn't have information about that.\nindustrial designer: But it has to work. And and and does it have to work only in English, or in Dutch too or \nproject manager: Nah, maybe \nmarketing: Ah that's a problem, but \nindustrial designer: And and uh w Yeah?\nmarketing: Uh only in English. Only in English I think.\nuser interface: What But uh I dunno how that works then. Uh does your uh Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's probably my job to figure that out, but \nuser interface: uh one to have in channel one?\nmarketing: No, that Yeah, then th we have to think about that. But do do we do it?\nuser interface: Yeah,\nmarketing: It's more if we if we do it.\nuser interface: I dunno. So, is it very usable? That's what I'm looking at.\nindustrial designer: And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: or \nproject manager: Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that.\nuser interface: Is \nproject manager: It We have short time to to put it on the market,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I dunno.\nproject manager: so that We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that.\nuser interface: Mm Yeah well {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think so. \nproject manager: We make uh make uh, we can make th th the new remote control very flashy. \nmarketing: Yeah, and uh and uh \nuser interface: It's \nmarketing: In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing. Uh because we we have a lot of languages.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I d Yeah. I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition.\nindustrial designer: And and \nproject manager: Yeah. I think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition, you can just throw the uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke, and the T_V_ turns uh to one.\nindustrial designer: the remote away. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah. Well yeah,\nmarketing: it's not uh \nuser interface: that's the right command. And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one, or something. Not just one,\nindustrial designer: But Hmm yeah, T_V_ one.\nuser interface: but \nmarketing: Okay, but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition.\nuser interface: Well I dunno. But I don't think, it just ain't useful enough.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: we have to make some decisions. So\nmarketing: Okay, no speech recognition.\nproject manager: you can see on the uh So we have to know what we're going to put on. Do we, do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything? Do \nuser interface: Yeah, I think so.\nproject manager: If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, so you can see what other but buttons there are, okay?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's good.\nproject manager: Okay, we just take that one.\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: And what else, we have \nuser interface: Also the one in the dark. So uh It lights up when it's dark?\nproject manager: Yeah, but it's Oh th I thought would, that that would be the same.\nuser interface: I didn't \nproject manager: If you push something, it it all lights up.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah, but um \nmarketing: it it mustn't work all the time.\nuser interface: Yes, that's what I mean.\nmarketing: It uh uh it have to work only when you use it.\nproject manager: Or you can switch it on or something.\nmarketing: So if you \nuser interface: Or maybe when you \nmarketing: No, if you use one button, it must turn uh on for twenty seconds, and then it must turn off.\nuser interface: yeah. It lights up all.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's right. You have to Yeah, that's right. That's what I said. It's the same as the telephone. Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay yeah. D Yeah, alright. Yeah.\nproject manager: And do we use a a Uh what's it called? Like a iMac, if you can look through it. Or just a normal remote control.\nuser interface: Maybe just as an option, w like we discussed, like iPod.\nindustrial designer: Mm, maybe it's a good idea.\nuser interface: Different colours, uh maybe use even different fonts.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Like uh phones.\nmarketing: Oh yeah.\nproject manager: Different colours. Okay,\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: so y you just make it th through You look through it?\nmarketing: A see-through. Mm, that's cool.\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh as an option maybe.\nproject manager: Okay. And so the buttons we have, this is, yeah, this is normal. We put in the the simple buttons on the top,\nuser interface: It's the standard \nproject manager: and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there.\nuser interface: Yeah, uh Yeah,\nmarketing: But you have You had a lot of different buttons.\nuser interface: we but we don't We don't really have any complicated buttons.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe you have you have to Uh when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one.\nuser interface: Yeah okay, but Yeah, well w I think the buttons are very easy. With just uh standard buttons we just have so little \nproject manager: O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. Because you ne almost never use it.\nuser interface: No, I don't need don't need Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's right.\nuser interface: I use teletext as well.\nindustrial designer: So uh \nmarketing: No, I use te teletext every day, I think.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah. For me too, it is. So we just keep it one level then? Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah, one level. And I think, uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons,\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: I think the design is most important. You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: 'Cause simple buttons.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: If you put one above it, it's clear.\nproject manager: Okay. So that's it for toda for We're going to have a lunch lunch break. Um \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: How long is lunch break?\nproject manager: So yeah, you know what you have to do. This is uh this is it. You get your meal and everything, so \nmarketing: Trendwatching. Okay. That's fine.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yo.\nproject manager: So, we're finished for t for this time. We're going to have some lunch.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Bye.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. \nuser interface: \nmarketing: Mm.

Sorry.\nuser interface: Uh let's see. Which one was mine?\nproject manager: So let's have a look, we have forty minutes, so it's it's more than enough. Okay, perfect. So we have Oh no, what's that?

Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting, so I showed uh show them to you. Oh, sorry about that, I just escape this one. How do I escape this? How do I I escape this s uh presentation?\nindustrial designer: What?\nuser interface: Uh left.\nindustrial designer: Uh \nproject manager: Ah okay.\nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: Just Yeah.\nproject manager: And show, sorry. Okay, so let's have a look s at this one. Okay, so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um Should be a univ uh universal remote control No, that's I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only. So have you changed that part?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so yeah, it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly. It's it's still the same. Um All these points uh we have to look at. You all know them. But uh there's another point. The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people. So they're old and not younger people. So we have to look at that as well. 'Specially old people, maybe bi bigger buttons or something, I dunno.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Uh so So yeah, that's it, so just you can do your presentation for uh \nuser interface: Which one first?\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Oh it doesn't matter, just start with the \nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm. Uh \nuser interface: Functional requirements, yeah\nmarketing: Okay. Well my name is Jens Damman, but we're in a group, and I I will start it. Wait. Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site. Uh I think you've uh read it too. Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site.\nproject manager: I I didn't read i read it, so it's not for me,\nmarketing: You didn't read it?\nproject manager: I didn't get it uh anyway.\nuser interface: No, I didn don't thing we got it.\nproject manager: It's only for you.\nmarketing: Oh okay, I I was the only one who get it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users. And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof. So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings. So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control. Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly. Yeah, I think uh uh that's a lot, so we have to make a beautiful remote control. Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy. I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people. Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good. Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at. Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot. Well okay, that's uh normal. I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons. But that's one of our requirements.\nproject manager: The last point is quite an interesting {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: Um Martijn alr already said it.\nproject manager: if we Yeah.\nmarketing: And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one, but I don't think it's uh\nproject manager: Yeah, we should have the ten percent on the on the top,\nmarketing: reachable.\nproject manager: then you're you're \nmarketing: Yeah, the ten percent on the top, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That that's a good one. Um uh page two. Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something. Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system, so when you clap your hands it will beep or something. Uh you must find it uh quickly.\nuser interface: Uh. Maybe just a button on the home station. So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station.\nmarketing: Okay, yeah. Yeah, we can uh combine that. Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control. Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this. It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent. But it's uh a tough one. Because if we make a ha whole new product, our own style, we we c uh this is so difficult, uh a difficulty I think. Uh next, remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. Yeah, but only if they zap a lot, and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something. I don't We we haven't Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point. Okay, last page.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets, like uh speech recognition. We didn't uh think about that already. And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control. We already thought about that. Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features. And but they're more critical. And older people uh want to spend uh more money. But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features, because they're in their old uh thinking way. And they want to keep the old uh things the old things. \nproject manager: So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus.\nmarketing: But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients?\nproject manager: People. So yeah, so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control,\nmarketing: I I think we can speak, uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: because Yeah.\nmarketing: because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros.\nproject manager: It's too Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um then I have my personal uh preference. Okay, that's not very good, because I thought about television, D_V_D_ player, stereo and V_C_R_. I had a question about. But it's already out of the question, this. Um my point is, well, I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television, I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros. But it's the exercise.\nproject manager: Because it's too expensive. Yeah, probably.\nmarketing: Yeah, only only for television uh On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything. And we only make it for television, so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special.\nuser interface: Yeah, but good usability, so you can use it.\nmarketing: Okay, I told about the home station. Uh it must be simple, because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it. And I I found a motto. And we put the fashion in electronics. And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style. We we have to make a a new product. We have to be um Yeah. One of a kind, I think.\nproject manager: So it has to look uh uh uh unique,\nuser interface: Unique.\nmarketing: The company is about our uh th th their own fashion, their own style.\nproject manager: but Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I reckon \nproject manager: But old people are not looking for that.\nuser interface: Uh I think mm \nproject manager: Not really.\nuser interface: Uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah. I think the main thing is the usability, that's where we can uh make it a special product.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah.\nmarketing: to k to keep it simple when you \nuser interface: But uh we also have to stand out,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Sorry I thought about it, yes.\nuser interface: 'cause there are already, like you said, so many controls out that support lot of stuff.

{"fname": "product_test_39", "dialogue": "project manager: Paul, you can do the next one if you want.\nmarketing: You can ask some questions or something.\nuser interface: Okay. Yeah well Uh.\nproject manager: It's on the on the uh net net uh thing,\nuser interface: There it is.\nproject manager: isn't it?\nuser interface: Okay. Technical functions design. Okay, well, so we have s mm uh broad audience. Isn't that isn't true anymore. But um we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple. Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard. So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls. Not too full, like uh Jens already said, only ten percent is being used.\nproject manager: So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or \nuser interface: Yeah, I have it on the next page.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff. Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use, and 'cause you have more room then, and for elderly people big buttons. Uh an icon on it or text on it, so it's very clear what that buttons does. So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it. Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people, elderly people what they use, what they want on a remote control\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: to find out. But there is already in a one done. Of functions I could think of. Uh volume, channels, the the basic according to . Just one two three etcetera. Uh text service options. Um basic on-off. And I found an uh Could I think of favourites? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: But if you could make a new option, that you just have to press one button and you get on your \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel. So you might as well remember the number. Or not?\nproject manager: Maybe i maybe it's too complicated,\nuser interface: No y\nproject manager: but not sure .\nuser interface: Well\nproject manager: It's a good idea, but \nuser interface: it's It was just a thought. So I'm, I u I would find it handy, I think, when you just press one button and you get on six six six.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay. But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button?\nuser interface: Well uh\nproject manager: Uh \nuser interface: what I was reading on the page. Uh a remote control just sends commands, basics commands to uh the television. So switch to channel six.\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nuser interface: So uh button six says says six. And if you make favourites, it can say six six six in a row. Just numbers. That can be in the in the \nindustrial designer: Yeah okay. But uh uh for a user to to remember, if I press that button it goes to that channel.\nuser interface: Well if you said a favourite \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but isn't it hard to remember? Like favourite one and \nproject manager: Uh mayb for me it's \nuser interface: Well i\nproject manager: If I use my telephone, I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never.\nuser interface: Never? Oh.\nindustrial designer: No, neither do I.\nproject manager: So \nuser interface: Oh are you?\nproject manager: And \nuser interface: Okay now, m maybe not.\nproject manager: If I don't do it, maybe old people {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, maybe elderly people uh. Right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I dunno.\nuser interface: They don't like new features. So maybe not.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um well play, pause. I dunno if that's usable\nproject manager: It's not, it's still not It's not anymore n uh \nuser interface: when Not anymore for T_V_.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Right, on off. I dunno, miss Did I miss any other buttons, basic buttons? I couldn't think of any other,'specially not for T_V_.\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: Just on the front as well. No, that's the only th the only thing you need.\nuser interface: Is \nindustrial designer: Uh uh the p uh next and previous. Previous I know, but next channel?\nuser interface: Just the channel um uh What I mean is uh \nindustrial designer: I don't thi\nmarketing: Forward.\nindustrial designer: Li like a web browser,\nuser interface: Six seven eight or five.\nindustrial designer: so Oh, okay.\nproject manager: Just very simple.\nindustrial designer: But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before. Like a web browser back button.\nuser interface: Um I dunno.\nproject manager: Uh Yeah,\nuser interface: I don't have Uh I did \nproject manager: I know what it is, but I think it's all too difficult for old people. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah,\nmarketing: No. Uh \nuser interface: I don't think you use that. Y only when you want to go to \nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time.\nproject manager: And how do you want to uh do it, like if you have a channel above ten?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Normally you can press one, zero or \nuser interface: Yeah, I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons. So you have that uh \nproject manager: A ten plus or \nuser interface: Yeah, the ten plus button. Just uh one one pressing, or quickly after each other.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: To just keep it simple and standard uh features.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough. Maybe the elderly people \nuser interface: Uh yeah mayb\nmarketing: It gets some seconds.\nuser interface: But I think that's in the T_V_ as well. That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it. But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's it's no it's not a \nuser interface: So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but that's th mm \nmarketing: It's what Paul says. It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two. It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: So if you have a universal T_V_ controller, you needed one button that has two uh stripes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So we have a a period of, I dunno, five seconds to press those buttons, and that And not for elderly people to look, one two uh press and aim and \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: But do we still need a two level remote control? Because if we only have that l only f\nmarketing: It's only for television now.\nuser interface: So I I don't think so.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: Uh I just thought of another one.\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So you also need a menu button. And then uh navigation uh But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: so you have\nindustrial designer: I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use, like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things, and uh the menu button.\nuser interface: four arrows.\nindustrial designer: Because you n almost never use menu button.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay,\nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: but um \nproject manager: Maybe it's still still a good idea, I'm not sure. You'll also have to use a mute button to to \nuser interface: Yeah, a mute button. Yes.\nproject manager: Maybe, not \nuser interface: Don't think so.\nproject manager: I don't know where where you have to put it.\nuser interface: Yeah well,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that's that's I think that's the layers that produce. Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on. What we're gonna use.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's right.\nuser interface: And later we can d uh do the design.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, uh now my personal preferences. Uh using the standards, basic Um I think that we should stand out uh unique, being unique with the design. So we have to, I dunno, uh make a different shape than usual. So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging, that it stands out. Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls.\nproject manager: Yeah. Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours\nuser interface: Um I dunno. Different colours um \nproject manager: or \nmarketing: Maybe we can give it out in different colours. You can choose blue or yellow\nproject manager: It's like a iMac or something.\nmarketing: or \nproject manager: Just to make it {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well why not? Or Yeah.\nmarketing: That's fa That's fancy. That's uh fashion.\nproject manager: But it looks cheap as well, because it's a small thing. It's only twenty five Euros. It looks very cheap if you make it \nuser interface: Well, maybe you can look at uh mobile phones.\nproject manager: Oh, you just I dunno what happened.\nuser interface: Oh.\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Who?\nproject manager: Yeah, we have to look at mobile phones, that's right. Just \nuser interface: They they're uh designed very well.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And well basically are the same, just a bit smaller. You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small, 'cause then you will always lo always lose it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But uh well, I think that's a good example.\nproject manager: Okay, \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: we hurry up a bit, because otherwise we won't make it.\nuser interface: Okay, sorry.\nproject manager: Is it fin Are you finished?\nuser interface: Well uh \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, I I'm finished.

Um\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we wi we will have your individual presentations, uh then the decision on the remote control concept, um and uh the closing. Forty minutes in total for this.

Hmm?\nuser interface: Alright.\nmarketing: Oh.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: .\nindustrial designer: Just press the okay button, it works.\nmarketing: Yeah,  Okay.\nproject manager: Um yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah. My method? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: How surprising. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, findings. Uh Ease of use is important, but uh innovation is more important, and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important. And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes, shoes and furniture,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and that they want spongy material. Probably watch too much Sponge Bob.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours. Simple shapes uh m material. But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group \nproject manager: Uh w wait a sec wait a se\nindustrial designer: Oh wait uh wait up.\nproject manager: uh could you go to the previous slide? Um because I'm taking minutes\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Um were the important themes enclose. Yeah okay. The feel of to be spongy \nindustrial designer: Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also?\nmarketing: Well, uh one example given was this, so um I assume they just want something colourful. Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something.\nindustrial designer: Not something dull.\nuser interface: But they like dark colours,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: you said in the p\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No, uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects.\nuser interface: Okay. Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow.\nmarketing: But \nuser interface: I had \nindustrial designer: But can you can you go back to that slide? The uh\nmarketing: Which one?\nindustrial designer: just one slide back,\nmarketing: This?\nindustrial designer: no no no. Yes. Okay, and the feel of the material has to be spongy.\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also, do you think? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well, it might.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control. But Maybe soft material or something. But not a real sponge.\nproject manager: Okay, so so, yeah, it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard. It it maybe it rubber or or \nmarketing: Yeah, exactly.\nproject manager: yeah. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, and like uh the older group likes familiar materials,\nuser interface: Or we could make oh.\nmarketing: but that doesn't mean we should use wood, So \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Well, this this is an example of what they would like. But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group, I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like.\nproject manager: Well, that's interesting.\nindustrial designer: It's quite interesting. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You could make a few v very colourful ones, and uh a very traditional co cover.\nuser interface: Yeah, o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens. The yellow uh rubber telephone.\nindustrial designer: Yes. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: It's the it's the rubber uh cover.\nproject manager: Yeah, it is, it is i yeah.\nuser interface: And it's uh colourful.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It looks likes a banana. We have the fruit, we have the colours. We have the simple design.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you know the phone?\nindustrial designer: I don't know the phone,\nproject manager: It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five,\nindustrial designer: but I can imagine it.\nproject manager: I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away,\nuser interface: Um thirty five.\nindustrial designer: Oh, that one, yes.\nproject manager: the very \nuser interface: And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow.\nindustrial designer: Now I kn uh oh, I know, I know. Yes, I I've seen it. I've seen it.\nproject manager: You kn you know, Ruud, as well? About th\nmarketing: I've seen it,\nproject manager: Okay. Okay. Um uh\nmarketing: but \nproject manager: okay. Do you have  uh thit that was \nmarketing: 'Kay. Uh that's about it.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay, so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials.\nmarketing: Uh soft material.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So So ease of use is important, but technology is twice as important. And what was even more important?\nmarketing: Uh the fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: Okay. So that's the most important thing for our customers.\nmarketing: Yes. Apparently.\nproject manager: Okay, Roo,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: could you do your presentation?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Well, I don't ha really have much to add, um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion. Um \nproject manager: Okay, well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about.\nuser interface: Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume. Well, a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these. These are both with uh with voice recognition, but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um, well, a weird um shape.\nproject manager: Shape.\nuser interface: So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But it didn't work. My pen didn't load um the information. So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint. But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control. Uh yellow.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic, so that's very good.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And what I'm thinking about, maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt, too slippery,\nindustrial designer: Slippery.\nproject manager: s because um \nuser interface: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone, it's rubber.\nindustrial designer: You have to grab it.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\nuser interface: So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes. There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in,\nproject manager: Yeah, ex for your fingers, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so you can get a really good grip on it. So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it. It's it's a lot easier.\nproject manager: Yeah. It grips automatically. Yeah, {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So m Yes.\nproject manager: okay.\nindustrial designer: But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation.\nproject manager: Okay, good.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Great. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information, in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh, well, the the fancy colours and uh and so on, and still have the ease of use, because we have an easy interface. And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on.\nproject manager: Yeah. Way too much I think for our goal,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: So if you have the voice recognition, you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, b but I think we'll \nindustrial designer: Okay, but I'll I'll go into that,\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities. Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division, and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design. Uh these are the things we've looked at. And of course I used the web to uh find my information. About the casing, we have three different casing possibilities. We have the uncurved or flat case. Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box. I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing. We have uh a curved one. It's uh curved in two dimensions. You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form. So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape, which is curved in three dimension. I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation. The the big remote control, something like that.\nuser interface: Yeah. Right.\nindustrial designer: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think. Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing. We can use plastic, which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice, but you can give it any colour, uh which is the same for rubber, but it's not slippery. We can use wood and titanium. Well, um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases. And these latex cases, there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source. Which brings me to the different energy sources. Um well, we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You really have to imagine like winding up your uh\nuser interface: Great. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, it would be very new to the market,\nindustrial designer: I d\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It would be very new,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but it's a kind of a retro uh style, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh Well,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: this is quite interesting. Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply. So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall, whatever you wish.\nuser interface: Like the watch.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It have it it has to move, that's the the sense of it. And you can store the energy in the in the thing.\nproject manager: I think um, if if I can hook on to that, um the kinetic thing is very funny.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. It's very funny indeed.\nproject manager: I mean solar is of course it's nice, but it's, well, your uh your calculator has a solar panel.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Indeed.\nproject manager: Um hand dynamo \nuser interface: But if you're watching a movie, how many times uh you take the the remote control and and \nproject manager: Well, maybe m\nuser interface: if uh if you have a watch, you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also.\nproject manager: Yeah, I know.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yes.\nuser interface: You you walk\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch.\nindustrial designer: But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy. the the shaking of your body, which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake, uh it charges it. But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy. So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time, and you want t to switch uh the channel or something,\nproject manager: Yeah. And wha\nindustrial designer: well, m it might not work. So that's something you have to keep in mind.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So, but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries, so we can save on the batteries\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy, use the kinetic energy, and otherwise use the batteries.\nproject manager: Okay, because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power.\nindustrial designer: Uh yes, it does.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I'll come to that later.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power, which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity. The user interface controls, um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels. And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons. So it's just like a mouse. You can scroll 'em, you can also push it. Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays, which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh and we also have double scroll-buttons, which are just two of these things. So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting, the the thing with the the round with the four \nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Oh, we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round.\nindustrial designer: Yes. That is possible too. Yes.\nuser interface:  But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels.\nproject manager: Well \nuser interface: I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it.\nindustrial designer: Well, mayb uh well, m me neither. Maybe when you integrate some functions.\nproject manager: This will be the remote, right?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um with uh maybe a channel selector. What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side?\nuser interface: Yeah, uh that's a possibility,\nindustrial designer: Uh it's do it's done before.\nproject manager: Because this is how you keep it \nuser interface: but \nindustrial designer: Yes. It's quite quite good, yes.\nuser interface: But Flores, think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for \nproject manager: Volume?\nindustrial designer: Well, it's it well, i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel.\nuser interface: A volume, okay.\nindustrial designer: There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel. You just use the wheel.\nproject manager: Well, what about mute?\nindustrial designer: About mute.\nproject manager: Thi i i m I guess uh th\nindustrial designer: Well, yes.\nproject manager: this is my volume button. And I can either on this side or this side um \nindustrial designer: Okay. Yes. Well, okay. Well, that that that's one possibility, okay.\nproject manager: And click it to muten the device.\nindustrial designer: Well, okay. It's quite goods.\nproject manager: And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market. So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yes.\nproject manager: So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh Ruud, wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar? Uh scroll-wheel.\nmarketing: Um Uh well,\nuser interface: Wheel.\nmarketing: it's obvious obviously new. So it might attract uh the young customers.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. But it's done before, uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio, pocket radios. We use this.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And Well, it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now.\nproject manager: Well, all the Sony telephones use it, for example, for volume.\nindustrial designer: So maybe it's not no .\nproject manager: Nokia has a well, okay, it's not really a scroll-wheel, but on their side th the the volume button is on the side, because you gri grab it like this.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yes, but it uses two separate buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah. I know, it's not really a scroll-wheel. No. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It doesn't use a . Well. Uh something for uh Roo here. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: For you too, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said, um the grip uh places in in the remote control. You have your hand on one place on the remote control, so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb.\nindustrial designer: Wi within reach. Yes, you have to.\nuser interface: So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect.\nindustrial designer: Yes. yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: Okay. Sebastian. Um \nindustrial designer: Okay, um we have to know, if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case, um you must use these push uh push-buttons. There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays. There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels, because it's all curved.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things. So that's a limitation. About um the components, uh just the hardware. We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal. Uh we have a simple, regular and advanced chip. And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker, which is a little cryptic uh to me. But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah, you can um I have some information about it. Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up. Of mute, let's say mute.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So so \nuser interface: Um you programme it, you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function\nindustrial designer: okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\nuser interface: and uh when you speak in the the remote control, it repeats uh your saying. that's the sample sensor. So So if you say mute, it says mute again,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: and then it's um well, I believe it's uh \nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: It performs the action. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So you say mute, he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute, and then goes to the mute function.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay, so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for. Okay. This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip, I thought. Um no op I'm not very sure. No, it's not in here. If we want to use the L_C_D_ display, we really need the advanced version, which is a bit l little bit more costly. If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version. And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip, which is a bit cheaper.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh well uh\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: d did we already decide on the display? To \nindustrial designer: Um no, but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well, I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it, but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: Especially when when we have to look at a cost, I don't think uh \nindustrial designer: I I don't think either.\nuser interface: 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen,\nindustrial designer: No. I don't think you need it.\nproject manager: On screen display. Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: Okay\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay, well\nproject manager: th\nindustrial designer: my conclusion, um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought. I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing, but they seem to like natural uh stuff. So maybe we should think about uh wood finish. Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy. It's more reliable, it's cheaper.\nproject manager: Okay. Good.\nindustrial designer: So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Kineti okay.\nindustrial designer: The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility. It's it's more advanced, but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries.\nproject manager: Okay, it's maybe a bit too too flashy,\nindustrial designer: Otherwise it will not too advanced,\nproject manager: too \nindustrial designer: uh well.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's in in in some way it can give us an advance, because you will save on your batteries.\nproject manager: Yeah, but that that's the same with the solar cell. That's no different.\nindustrial designer: But Yes. And I think it's more robust.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay.\nindustrial designer: It's more uh Uh it's more functional.\nuser interface: But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs? So if you use titanium {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No no, but the uh um that's what Sebastian said.\nindustrial designer: The titanium thing uh we have to skip it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference. But but yet, I understood that the market is different.\nuser interface: Okay. Oh,\nproject manager: So um \nuser interface: sorry. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and we should uh use wood or something like that.\nproject manager: No,\nuser interface: And I would think \nmarketing: And\nproject manager: r\nmarketing: yeah,\nproject manager: rubber with colours.\nmarketing: the yeah, the older people liked wood.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay, sorry. So it it needs to be rubber.\nmarketing: No the \nproject manager: Colourful and \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, the younger people liked soft material.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay, spongy materials.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay, um well um these scroll-wheels, I think uh they they can be they can be handy.\nuser interface: And they can be implemented with a regular chip?\nindustrial designer: So Yes, they can. But they really need the regular chip, you cannot use the sa simple \nuser interface: Okay, but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker \nindustrial designer: Well, I'm not very sure. Maybe that's an uh a different \nuser interface: oh,\nproject manager: But but do we want the curved uh uh design,\nuser interface: evalu\nproject manager: or \nindustrial designer: I think so, if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design, i uh it's too dull.\nproject manager: I it's too dull. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't think c our customers will like it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And um if you uh take the double-curved, uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: So I think this is the best of two worlds.\nproject manager: Okay, what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue. Because it it's of cour\nindustrial designer: Yes. It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's very unlogical.\nuser interface: But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all.\nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: Well the there has to be some pointing at. But \nproject manager: It depends also on your on your \nuser interface: Well, if you if you take your hand before it, okay, it won't work, but you can point it just to the other wall.\nproject manager: Well, it depends on your walls actually. If you have uh have um smooth walls, it it it probably you're probably right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: But if you have carpets on the wall, which our natural loving friends probably do have, then um yeah, th th it might be a bit more of a issue.\nindustrial designer: All lights get absorbed, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Yes, because the walls they they reflect the infrared light.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it has an it's easier. Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample. Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um with a with a regular chip.\nuser interface: And the regular chip.\nindustrial designer: I think uh it gives us the advantage of \nuser interface: And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes, yes.\nproject manager: I like the scroll wheels uh idea.\nindustrial designer: And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't think it it's any uh value added thing.\nuser interface: No. Think so too.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Well, it looks uh yeah, well um\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: according to Ruud, the the the market likes um new flashy technology,\nindustrial designer: Technology.\nproject manager: and I mean L_C_D_ is \nindustrial designer: Yes. It's not very flashy and new.\nproject manager: well, ok I know, but it's m it's less um s standard\nmarketing: Standard?\nproject manager: than than Well, we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part. That's the problem.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance, I would say do integrate it,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: But we already have the scroll-wheels, the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition, the rubber, the fancy colours.\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think our customers will go insane.\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: It's it's too much.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, I I agree. I think i Ruud, do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or \nmarketing: Nah, um n no, I don't think so. M\nproject manager: No? Sebast uh nee, Roo? Roo, do you have any other \nuser interface: Um no. Nothing more.\nproject manager: Nothing more. Um \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. Uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the \nproject manager: Sebas\nindustrial designer: what is the next phase f Flores?\nproject manager: Well, we we need to describe uh decisions now.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So um\nindustrial designer: So i\nproject manager: on the energy, well, we decided.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Chip.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay.\nproject manager: User interface um\nuser interface: Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case? Yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yes, they can work.\nuser interface: Sorry, yeah.\nindustrial designer: They cannot work with double-curved.\nuser interface: Oh, sorry. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's that's problem. I'll check it for you.\nproject manager: Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product. I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian. Uh you talked about it before, the colours, grey and yellow.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Keep it in mind. And um the buttons, well we talked about it now. The next phase, um Sebastian, um is um the design of the look and feel. The user interface design.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: And for you, the product evaluation. Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: And I'm going uh to plan my holidays. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: The project drawing is for the next \nindustrial designer: So you will be on the Bahamas. Uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes, uh you will have a uh prototype ready.\nuser interface: Yeah, right.\nindustrial designer: Okay. So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made?\nproject manager: Yeah? I can. Um maybe one of you could write it down.\nindustrial designer: I'll do.\nproject manager: Great. Um Uh you you need to help me. Um \nindustrial designer: Okay. W start with the casing.\nproject manager: The casing is curved, single-curved.\nuser interface: Single-curved.\nindustrial designer: Okay, single-curved case. Okay. What about the energy source?\nproject manager: Traditional batteries uh and solar.\nuser interface: But can there be uh wor can they work together? Or do we have to choose between them?\nproject manager: No,\nuser interface: 'Cause if we have to choose \nproject manager: they can be complementary. Uh al al I uh \nuser interface: yeah?\nindustrial designer: I I think they can. Yes.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Well, uh \nproject manager: Every device \nuser interface: What if not?\nindustrial designer: It it should be. There should be really no problem.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: They can be supplementary. That's no problem.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, um\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: th\nindustrial designer: So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar.\nproject manager: Battery and solar, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay. What about uh the finishing of the case? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber?\nproject manager: Yeah, with colourful rubber.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers, but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish.\nindustrial designer: Okay, and I think we should use the company colours. Something like black and red. uh black and yellow.\nproject manager: Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow. Yeah.\nuser interface: Grey and yellow.\nindustrial designer: Grey yellow, okay.\nuser interface: Yellow case and grey buttons, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, although I don't think that's very colourful. Except for the yellow of course,\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours.\nindustrial designer: Oh, I think it's uh it's not very dull. It's quite modern actually. Don't you think?\nproject manager: Well, I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before.\nuser interface: I believe the But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button. And um Well well \nproject manager: Well, it it doesn't have to be red. Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for. Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours, it should be a full colour cover with such an image\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group, I guess.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Or black and yellow.\nproject manager: Black and yellow, yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device. Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself. But \nuser interface: Well, there is. Just a week ago, a keyboard manufacturer would print,\nindustrial designer: Oh, I've read.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: with and uh \nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes,\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques. They're actually very slow in its techniques.\nproject manager: Okay, so we have to deal with wh what's possible here.\nindustrial designer: So So I'm afraid it's not possible.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay. Um more f more more decisions we made. Um Um \nuser interface: A scroll-wheel.\nproject manager: The scroll-heel. Yes, the voice recognition we already decided.\nuser interface: Voice recognition, of course.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so scroll-wheel. But there will be some additional buttons, I guess.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And th the they should be spongy also, because they're they're rubber too.\nproject manager: Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: What what did you say?\nindustrial designer: Well uh you can use well, when you use the buttons, they'll they'll be made of rubber too.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it has th the spongy uh feel also.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, or you could use plastic buttons. In the rubber.\nproject manager: I think rubber is nice. Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button, and what do they want spongy uh uh devices, or or i\nuser interface: Yeah, b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually.\nproject manager: .\nuser interface: What I said in the in the first uh discussion, uh the digit six on the button, it will disappear when it's from rubber.\nproject manager: Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so?\nuser interface: It is not uh something uh it's no information I read about it or so, but it's just from \nmarketing: Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition?\nuser interface: No, but but uh it \nmarketing: 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button.\nproject manager: Yeah. You could place a um uh this this would be the button.\nmarketing: There the icons.\nproject manager: The scroll-wheel, I mean. And you could place the indica th th the signals the \nuser interface: Yeah, b yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's possible,\nindustrial designer: That's okay.\nmarketing: So you don't touch the icons that much.\nuser interface: but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case. So still then, if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control, you just rub on the cover, so you rub on the painting.\nproject manager: No no, there's no painting, only uh yellow or But it's into the rubber.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah, but but the the plus or the minus.\nproject manager: Yeah, but this is on the pla\nuser interface: You have to draw the \nindustrial designer: Yes, the signs.\nproject manager: yeah, I know. Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's on the cover. So if you uh You just move the problem.\nproject manager: What about um making this rubber and making this plastic?\nindustrial designer: Uh I see what you mean. Well, maybe that's possible, because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing. So maybe they can combine these two.\nproject manager: Yeah. Well actually, we should have it the other way around, I guess. A plastic cover with rubber finishing. I mean, this is this is the finishing. This is um what's on the edge. What you feel.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But the front, on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: I mean \nindustrial designer: Well, I'm I'm not so sure,\nuser interface: Y uh can you separate these uh these \nindustrial designer: I think it c should be Well, I'm not sure, I have to ask with manufacturing, but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want, because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel, and that's what you get with rubber. So if you want the spongy feel, you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber.\nproject manager: I know, but do you touch this or do you touch this?\nindustrial designer: I think both.\nproject manager: I mean, I I never touch between the buttons.\nuser interface: I do. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I do.\nuser interface: Or the s uh the sideways.\nindustrial designer: I think \nuser interface: Or the the back. Or the back.\nproject manager: Yeah, the side, exactly, the sideways. The side, but do you touch between the the these buttons?\nuser interface: I think Yes, especially when there are l a few buttons on it, you have uh a lot of space to touch. So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it.\nproject manager: Okay. Well, we do not have very much time uh left. Um I guess you two have to figure that out. I'm going to leave the decision to you,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: um because you have to make its prototype, and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers, the possibilities and uh \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: so I'm going to leave it the decision with you. Um Sebastian, did you write enough decisions down?\nindustrial designer: Um not quite. Um what about uh the chips? We use the regular chip?\nuser interface: Regular.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And \nuser interface: Use with .\nindustrial designer: Well no, I think that's about it. Yes.\nproject manager: Okay. With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions. The chip is is not really \nindustrial designer: The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_. That's all.\nproject manager: Okay, well.\nindustrial designer: And we've decided not to use L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Um okay, then I think we are uh quite finished. Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um \nuser interface: . For the finishing touch.\nproject manager: Yeah? Yeah, um if you write wrote anything down, uh could you put it on the shared folder?\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: Uh yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But um Sebastian has everything.\nproject manager: I know, but well \nindustrial designer: I'll put it online.\nproject manager: Great. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "This is the third meeting of the design group. At first, Marketing revealed that ease of use, innovation and a fancy look and feel could be important to customers and the team discussed what colour and material they should use.

{"fname": "product_test_41", "dialogue": "project manager: Do you need to change anything on it? Because otherwise I will already open it.\nmarketing: Um Mm, don't think so.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Unless uh things have suddenly change again.\nproject manager: Is it much changes?\nmarketing: Uh don't know. Maybe uh you've got new information, like uh last time.\nproject manager: Uh I didn't No no. I do hot have Only the same information. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Hello, Sebastian.\nindustrial designer: Hello hello Mister P_M_.\nproject manager: I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well, in the control room.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, that's where the thinking goes on. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh, it's that Roo again, always late.\nuser interface: Bongiorno.\nproject manager: Bongiorno.\nindustrial designer: I think you should punish him.\nproject manager: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You're the P_M_. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Punish. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I see some interesting \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: okay.\nuser interface: You wish. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Possibilities, yeah? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: People, welcome back.\nuser interface: Welcome. Uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The third meeting. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oop.\nproject manager: Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out. Um first of all, um if you make minutes yourself as well, uh like Sebastian does, um could you put them on the shared folder? If you do not make minutes, no problem, but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report. Um the second thing, um I was th uh s thinking to myself, I have this little remote control, and I'm talking to it, but I still need to point to the television, because it works with infrared. That's quite strange.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Okay. We'll come to that later, I g I think.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Not at all.\nproject manager: Okay. Um\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we wi we will have your individual presentations, uh then the decision on the remote control concept, um and uh the closing. Forty minutes in total for this. So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations, um the progress you've made.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first, because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation.\nmarketing: 'Kay. Hmm?\nuser interface: Alright.\nmarketing: Oh.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: .\nindustrial designer: Just press the okay button, it works.\nmarketing: Yeah,  Okay.\nproject manager: Um yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah. My method? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: How surprising. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, findings. Uh Ease of use is important, but uh innovation is more important, and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important. And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes, shoes and furniture,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and that they want spongy material. Probably watch too much Sponge Bob.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours. Simple shapes uh m material. But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group \nproject manager: Uh w wait a sec wait a se\nindustrial designer: Oh wait uh wait up.\nproject manager: uh could you go to the previous slide? Um because I'm taking minutes\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Um were the important themes enclose. Yeah okay. The feel of to be spongy \nindustrial designer: Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also?\nmarketing: Well, uh one example given was this, so um I assume they just want something colourful. Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something.\nindustrial designer: Not something dull.\nuser interface: But they like dark colours,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: you said in the p\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No, uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects.\nuser interface: Okay. Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow.\nmarketing: But \nuser interface: I had \nindustrial designer: But can you can you go back to that slide? The uh\nmarketing: Which one?\nindustrial designer: just one slide back,\nmarketing: This?\nindustrial designer: no no no. Yes. Okay, and the feel of the material has to be spongy.\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also, do you think? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well, it might.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control. But Maybe soft material or something. But not a real sponge.\nproject manager: Okay, so so, yeah, it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard. It it maybe it rubber or or \nmarketing: Yeah, exactly.\nproject manager: yeah. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, and like uh the older group likes familiar materials,\nuser interface: Or we could make oh.\nmarketing: but that doesn't mean we should use wood, So \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Well, this this is an example of what they would like. But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group, I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like.\nproject manager: Well, that's interesting.\nindustrial designer: It's quite interesting. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You could make a few v very colourful ones, and uh a very traditional co cover.\nuser interface: Yeah, o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens. The yellow uh rubber telephone.\nindustrial designer: Yes. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: It's the it's the rubber uh cover.\nproject manager: Yeah, it is, it is i yeah.\nuser interface: And it's uh colourful.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It looks likes a banana. We have the fruit, we have the colours. We have the simple design.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you know the phone?\nindustrial designer: I don't know the phone,\nproject manager: It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five,\nindustrial designer: but I can imagine it.\nproject manager: I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away,\nuser interface: Um thirty five.\nindustrial designer: Oh, that one, yes.\nproject manager: the very \nuser interface: And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow.\nindustrial designer: Now I kn uh oh, I know, I know. Yes, I I've seen it. I've seen it.\nproject manager: You kn you know, Ruud, as well? About th\nmarketing: I've seen it,\nproject manager: Okay. Okay. Um uh\nmarketing: but \nproject manager: okay. Do you have  uh thit that was \nmarketing: 'Kay. Uh that's about it.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay, so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials.\nmarketing: Uh soft material.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So So ease of use is important, but technology is twice as important. And what was even more important?\nmarketing: Uh the fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: Okay. So that's the most important thing for our customers.\nmarketing: Yes. Apparently.\nproject manager: Okay, Roo,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: could you do your presentation?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Well, I don't ha really have much to add, um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion. Um \nproject manager: Okay, well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about.\nuser interface: Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume. Well, a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these. These are both with uh with voice recognition, but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um, well, a weird um shape.\nproject manager: Shape.\nuser interface: So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But it didn't work. My pen didn't load um the information. So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint. But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control. Uh yellow.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic, so that's very good.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And what I'm thinking about, maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt, too slippery,\nindustrial designer: Slippery.\nproject manager: s because um \nuser interface: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone, it's rubber.\nindustrial designer: You have to grab it.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\nuser interface: So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes. There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in,\nproject manager: Yeah, ex for your fingers, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so you can get a really good grip on it. So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it. It's it's a lot easier.\nproject manager: Yeah. It grips automatically. Yeah, {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So m Yes.\nproject manager: okay.\nindustrial designer: But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation.\nproject manager: Okay, good.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Great. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information, in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh, well, the the fancy colours and uh and so on, and still have the ease of use, because we have an easy interface. And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on.\nproject manager: Yeah. Way too much I think for our goal,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: So if you have the voice recognition, you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, b but I think we'll \nindustrial designer: Okay, but I'll I'll go into that,\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities. Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division, and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design. Uh these are the things we've looked at. And of course I used the web to uh find my information. About the casing, we have three different casing possibilities. We have the uncurved or flat case. Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box. I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing. We have uh a curved one. It's uh curved in two dimensions. You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form. So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape, which is curved in three dimension. I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation. The the big remote control, something like that.\nuser interface: Yeah. Right.\nindustrial designer: But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think. Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing. We can use plastic, which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice, but you can give it any colour, uh which is the same for rubber, but it's not slippery. We can use wood and titanium. Well, um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases. And these latex cases, there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source. Which brings me to the different energy sources. Um well, we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You really have to imagine like winding up your uh\nuser interface: Great. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, it would be very new to the market,\nindustrial designer: I d\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It would be very new,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but it's a kind of a retro uh style, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh Well,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: this is quite interesting. Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply. So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall, whatever you wish.\nuser interface: Like the watch.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It have it it has to move, that's the the sense of it. And you can store the energy in the in the thing.\nproject manager: I think um, if if I can hook on to that, um the kinetic thing is very funny.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. It's very funny indeed.\nproject manager: I mean solar is of course it's nice, but it's, well, your uh your calculator has a solar panel.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Indeed.\nproject manager: Um hand dynamo \nuser interface: But if you're watching a movie, how many times uh you take the the remote control and and \nproject manager: Well, maybe m\nuser interface: if uh if you have a watch, you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also.\nproject manager: Yeah, I know.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yes.\nuser interface: You you walk\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch.\nindustrial designer: But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy. the the shaking of your body, which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake, uh it charges it. But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy. So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time, and you want t to switch uh the channel or something,\nproject manager: Yeah. And wha\nindustrial designer: well, m it might not work. So that's something you have to keep in mind.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So, but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries, so we can save on the batteries\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy, use the kinetic energy, and otherwise use the batteries.\nproject manager: Okay, because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power.\nindustrial designer: Uh yes, it does.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I'll come to that later.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power, which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity. The user interface controls, um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels. And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons. So it's just like a mouse. You can scroll 'em, you can also push it. Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays, which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh and we also have double scroll-buttons, which are just two of these things. So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting, the the thing with the the round with the four \nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Oh, we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round.\nindustrial designer: Yes. That is possible too. Yes.\nuser interface:  But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels.\nproject manager: Well \nuser interface: I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it.\nindustrial designer: Well, mayb uh well, m me neither. Maybe when you integrate some functions.\nproject manager: This will be the remote, right?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um with uh maybe a channel selector. What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side?\nuser interface: Yeah, uh that's a possibility,\nindustrial designer: Uh it's do it's done before.\nproject manager: Because this is how you keep it \nuser interface: but \nindustrial designer: Yes. It's quite quite good, yes.\nuser interface: But Flores, think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for \nproject manager: Volume?\nindustrial designer: Well, it's it well, i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel.\nuser interface: A volume, okay.\nindustrial designer: There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel. You just use the wheel.\nproject manager: Well, what about mute?\nindustrial designer: About mute.\nproject manager: Thi i i m I guess uh th\nindustrial designer: Well, yes.\nproject manager: this is my volume button. And I can either on this side or this side um \nindustrial designer: Okay. Yes. Well, okay. Well, that that that's one possibility, okay.\nproject manager: And click it to muten the device.\nindustrial designer: Well, okay. It's quite goods.\nproject manager: And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market. So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yes.\nproject manager: So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh Ruud, wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar? Uh scroll-wheel.\nmarketing: Um Uh well,\nuser interface: Wheel.\nmarketing: it's obvious obviously new. So it might attract uh the young customers.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. But it's done before, uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio, pocket radios. We use this.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And Well, it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now.\nproject manager: Well, all the Sony telephones use it, for example, for volume.\nindustrial designer: So maybe it's not no .\nproject manager: Nokia has a well, okay, it's not really a scroll-wheel, but on their side th the the volume button is on the side, because you gri grab it like this.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yes, but it uses two separate buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah. I know, it's not really a scroll-wheel. No. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It doesn't use a . Well. Uh something for uh Roo here. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: For you too, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said, um the grip uh places in in the remote control. You have your hand on one place on the remote control, so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb.\nindustrial designer: Wi within reach. Yes, you have to.\nuser interface: So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect.\nindustrial designer: Yes. yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: Okay. Sebastian. Um \nindustrial designer: Okay, um we have to know, if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case, um you must use these push uh push-buttons. There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays. There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels, because it's all curved.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things. So that's a limitation. About um the components, uh just the hardware. We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal. Uh we have a simple, regular and advanced chip. And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker, which is a little cryptic uh to me. But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah, you can um I have some information about it. Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up. Of mute, let's say mute.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So so \nuser interface: Um you programme it, you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function\nindustrial designer: okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\nuser interface: and uh when you speak in the the remote control, it repeats uh your saying. that's the sample sensor. So So if you say mute, it says mute again,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: and then it's um well, I believe it's uh \nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: It performs the action. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So you say mute, he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute, and then goes to the mute function.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay, so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for. Okay. This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip, I thought. Um no op I'm not very sure. No, it's not in here. If we want to use the L_C_D_ display, we really need the advanced version, which is a bit l little bit more costly. If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version. And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip, which is a bit cheaper.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh well uh\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: d did we already decide on the display? To \nindustrial designer: Um no, but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well, I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it, but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: Especially when when we have to look at a cost, I don't think uh \nindustrial designer: I I don't think either.\nuser interface: 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen,\nindustrial designer: No. I don't think you need it.\nproject manager: On screen display. Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: Okay\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay, well\nproject manager: th\nindustrial designer: my conclusion, um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought. I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing, but they seem to like natural uh stuff. So maybe we should think about uh wood finish. Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy. It's more reliable, it's cheaper.\nproject manager: Okay. Good.\nindustrial designer: So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Kineti okay.\nindustrial designer: The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility. It's it's more advanced, but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries.\nproject manager: Okay, it's maybe a bit too too flashy,\nindustrial designer: Otherwise it will not too advanced,\nproject manager: too \nindustrial designer: uh well.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's in in in some way it can give us an advance, because you will save on your batteries.\nproject manager: Yeah, but that that's the same with the solar cell. That's no different.\nindustrial designer: But Yes. And I think it's more robust.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay.\nindustrial designer: It's more uh Uh it's more functional.\nuser interface: But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs? So if you use titanium {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No no, but the uh um that's what Sebastian said.\nindustrial designer: The titanium thing uh we have to skip it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference. But but yet, I understood that the market is different.\nuser interface: Okay. Oh,\nproject manager: So um \nuser interface: sorry. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and we should uh use wood or something like that.\nproject manager: No,\nuser interface: And I would think \nmarketing: And\nproject manager: r\nmarketing: yeah,\nproject manager: rubber with colours.\nmarketing: the yeah, the older people liked wood.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay, sorry. So it it needs to be rubber.\nmarketing: No the \nproject manager: Colourful and \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, the younger people liked soft material.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay, spongy materials.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay, um well um these scroll-wheels, I think uh they they can be they can be handy.\nuser interface: And they can be implemented with a regular chip?\nindustrial designer: So Yes, they can. But they really need the regular chip, you cannot use the sa simple \nuser interface: Okay, but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker \nindustrial designer: Well, I'm not very sure. Maybe that's an uh a different \nuser interface: oh,\nproject manager: But but do we want the curved uh uh design,\nuser interface: evalu\nproject manager: or \nindustrial designer: I think so, if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design, i uh it's too dull.\nproject manager: I it's too dull. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't think c our customers will like it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And um if you uh take the double-curved, uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: So I think this is the best of two worlds.\nproject manager: Okay, what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue. Because it it's of cour\nindustrial designer: Yes. It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's very unlogical.\nuser interface: But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all.\nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: Well the there has to be some pointing at. But \nproject manager: It depends also on your on your \nuser interface: Well, if you if you take your hand before it, okay, it won't work, but you can point it just to the other wall.\nproject manager: Well, it depends on your walls actually. If you have uh have um smooth walls, it it it probably you're probably right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: But if you have carpets on the wall, which our natural loving friends probably do have, then um yeah, th th it might be a bit more of a issue.\nindustrial designer: All lights get absorbed, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Yes, because the walls they they reflect the infrared light.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it has an it's easier. Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample. Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um with a with a regular chip.\nuser interface: And the regular chip.\nindustrial designer: I think uh it gives us the advantage of \nuser interface: And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes, yes.\nproject manager: I like the scroll wheels uh idea.\nindustrial designer: And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't think it it's any uh value added thing.\nuser interface: No. Think so too.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Well, it looks uh yeah, well um\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: according to Ruud, the the the market likes um new flashy technology,\nindustrial designer: Technology.\nproject manager: and I mean L_C_D_ is \nindustrial designer: Yes. It's not very flashy and new.\nproject manager: well, ok I know, but it's m it's less um s standard\nmarketing: Standard?\nproject manager: than than Well, we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part. That's the problem.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance, I would say do integrate it,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: But we already have the scroll-wheels, the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition, the rubber, the fancy colours.\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think our customers will go insane.\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: It's it's too much.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, I I agree. I think i Ruud, do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or \nmarketing: Nah, um n no, I don't think so. M\nproject manager: No? Sebast uh nee, Roo? Roo, do you have any other \nuser interface: Um no. Nothing more.\nproject manager: Nothing more. Um \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. Uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the \nproject manager: Sebas\nindustrial designer: what is the next phase f Flores?\nproject manager: Well, we we need to describe uh decisions now.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So um\nindustrial designer: So i\nproject manager: on the energy, well, we decided.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Chip.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay.\nproject manager: User interface um\nuser interface: Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case? Yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yes, they can work.\nuser interface: Sorry, yeah.\nindustrial designer: They cannot work with double-curved.\nuser interface: Oh, sorry. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's that's problem. I'll check it for you.\nproject manager: Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product. I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian. Uh you talked about it before, the colours, grey and yellow.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Keep it in mind. And um the buttons, well we talked about it now. The next phase, um Sebastian, um is um the design of the look and feel. The user interface design.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: And for you, the product evaluation. Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: And I'm going uh to plan my holidays. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: The project drawing is for the next \nindustrial designer: So you will be on the Bahamas. Uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes, uh you will have a uh prototype ready.\nuser interface: Yeah, right.\nindustrial designer: Okay. So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made?\nproject manager: Yeah? I can. Um maybe one of you could write it down.\nindustrial designer: I'll do.\nproject manager: Great. Um Uh you you need to help me. Um \nindustrial designer: Okay. W start with the casing.\nproject manager: The casing is curved, single-curved.\nuser interface: Single-curved.\nindustrial designer: Okay, single-curved case. Okay. What about the energy source?\nproject manager: Traditional batteries uh and solar.\nuser interface: But can there be uh wor can they work together? Or do we have to choose between them?\nproject manager: No,\nuser interface: 'Cause if we have to choose \nproject manager: they can be complementary. Uh al al I uh \nuser interface: yeah?\nindustrial designer: I I think they can. Yes.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Well, uh \nproject manager: Every device \nuser interface: What if not?\nindustrial designer: It it should be. There should be really no problem.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: They can be supplementary. That's no problem.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, um\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: th\nindustrial designer: So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar.\nproject manager: Battery and solar, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay. What about uh the finishing of the case? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber?\nproject manager: Yeah, with colourful rubber.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers, but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish.\nindustrial designer: Okay, and I think we should use the company colours. Something like black and red. uh black and yellow.\nproject manager: Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow. Yeah.\nuser interface: Grey and yellow.\nindustrial designer: Grey yellow, okay.\nuser interface: Yellow case and grey buttons, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, although I don't think that's very colourful. Except for the yellow of course,\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours.\nindustrial designer: Oh, I think it's uh it's not very dull. It's quite modern actually. Don't you think?\nproject manager: Well, I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before.\nuser interface: I believe the But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button. And um Well well \nproject manager: Well, it it doesn't have to be red. Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for. Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours, it should be a full colour cover with such an image\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group, I guess.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Or black and yellow.\nproject manager: Black and yellow, yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device. Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself. But \nuser interface: Well, there is. Just a week ago, a keyboard manufacturer would print,\nindustrial designer: Oh, I've read.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: with and uh \nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes,\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques. They're actually very slow in its techniques.\nproject manager: Okay, so we have to deal with wh what's possible here.\nindustrial designer: So So I'm afraid it's not possible.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay. Um more f more more decisions we made. Um Um \nuser interface: A scroll-wheel.\nproject manager: The scroll-heel. Yes, the voice recognition we already decided.\nuser interface: Voice recognition, of course.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so scroll-wheel. But there will be some additional buttons, I guess.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And th the they should be spongy also, because they're they're rubber too.\nproject manager: Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: What what did you say?\nindustrial designer: Well uh you can use well, when you use the buttons, they'll they'll be made of rubber too.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it has th the spongy uh feel also.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, or you could use plastic buttons. In the rubber.\nproject manager: I think rubber is nice. Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button, and what do they want spongy uh uh devices, or or i\nuser interface: Yeah, b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually.\nproject manager: .\nuser interface: What I said in the in the first uh discussion, uh the digit six on the button, it will disappear when it's from rubber.\nproject manager: Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so?\nuser interface: It is not uh something uh it's no information I read about it or so, but it's just from \nmarketing: Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition?\nuser interface: No, but but uh it \nmarketing: 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button.\nproject manager: Yeah. You could place a um uh this this would be the button.\nmarketing: There the icons.\nproject manager: The scroll-wheel, I mean. And you could place the indica th th the signals the \nuser interface: Yeah, b yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's possible,\nindustrial designer: That's okay.\nmarketing: So you don't touch the icons that much.\nuser interface: but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case. So still then, if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control, you just rub on the cover, so you rub on the painting.\nproject manager: No no, there's no painting, only uh yellow or But it's into the rubber.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah, but but the the plus or the minus.\nproject manager: Yeah, but this is on the pla\nuser interface: You have to draw the \nindustrial designer: Yes, the signs.\nproject manager: yeah, I know. Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's on the cover. So if you uh You just move the problem.\nproject manager: What about um making this rubber and making this plastic?\nindustrial designer: Uh I see what you mean. Well, maybe that's possible, because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing. So maybe they can combine these two.\nproject manager: Yeah. Well actually, we should have it the other way around, I guess. A plastic cover with rubber finishing. I mean, this is this is the finishing. This is um what's on the edge. What you feel.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But the front, on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: I mean \nindustrial designer: Well, I'm I'm not so sure,\nuser interface: Y uh can you separate these uh these \nindustrial designer: I think it c should be Well, I'm not sure, I have to ask with manufacturing, but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want, because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel, and that's what you get with rubber. So if you want the spongy feel, you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber.\nproject manager: I know, but do you touch this or do you touch this?\nindustrial designer: I think both.\nproject manager: I mean, I I never touch between the buttons.\nuser interface: I do. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I do.\nuser interface: Or the s uh the sideways.\nindustrial designer: I think \nuser interface: Or the the back. Or the back.\nproject manager: Yeah, the side, exactly, the sideways. The side, but do you touch between the the these buttons?\nuser interface: I think Yes, especially when there are l a few buttons on it, you have uh a lot of space to touch. So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it.\nproject manager: Okay. Well, we do not have very much time uh left. Um I guess you two have to figure that out. I'm going to leave the decision to you,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: um because you have to make its prototype, and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers, the possibilities and uh \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: so I'm going to leave it the decision with you. Um Sebastian, did you write enough decisions down?\nindustrial designer: Um not quite. Um what about uh the chips? We use the regular chip?\nuser interface: Regular.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And \nuser interface: Use with .\nindustrial designer: Well no, I think that's about it. Yes.\nproject manager: Okay. With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions. The chip is is not really \nindustrial designer: The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_. That's all.\nproject manager: Okay, well.\nindustrial designer: And we've decided not to use L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Um okay, then I think we are uh quite finished. Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um \nuser interface: . For the finishing touch.\nproject manager: Yeah? Yeah, um if you write wrote anything down, uh could you put it on the shared folder?\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: Uh yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But um Sebastian has everything.\nproject manager: I know, but well \nindustrial designer: I'll put it online.\nproject manager: Great. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right.", "en_query": "What's the decision of the whole meeting?", "zh_query": "会议做了怎样的决定？", "fr_query": "Quelle est la décision de toute la réunion ?", "ukr_query": "Яке рішення прийняли на зустрічі?", "en_summary": "The team decided to make a single-curved remote control with colourful rubber.

{"fname": "product_test_42", "dialogue": "marketing: Well, findings. Uh Ease of use is important, but uh innovation is more important, and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important. And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes, shoes and furniture,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and that they want spongy material. Probably watch too much Sponge Bob.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours. Simple shapes uh m material. But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group \nproject manager: Uh w wait a sec wait a se\nindustrial designer: Oh wait uh wait up.\nproject manager: uh could you go to the previous slide? Um because I'm taking minutes\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Um were the important themes enclose. Yeah okay. The feel of to be spongy \nindustrial designer: Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also?\nmarketing: Well, uh one example given was this, so um I assume they just want something colourful. Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something.\nindustrial designer: Not something dull.\nuser interface: But they like dark colours,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: you said in the p\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No, uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects.\nuser interface: Okay. Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow.\nmarketing: But \nuser interface: I had \nindustrial designer: But can you can you go back to that slide? The uh\nmarketing: Which one?\nindustrial designer: just one slide back,\nmarketing: This?\nindustrial designer: no no no. Yes. Okay, and the feel of the material has to be spongy.\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also, do you think? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well, it might.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control. But Maybe soft material or something. But not a real sponge.\nproject manager: Okay, so so, yeah, it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard. It it maybe it rubber or or \nmarketing: Yeah, exactly.\nproject manager: yeah. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, and like uh the older group likes familiar materials,\nuser interface: Or we could make oh.\nmarketing: but that doesn't mean we should use wood, So \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Well, this this is an example of what they would like. But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group, I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like.\nproject manager: Well, that's interesting.\nindustrial designer: It's quite interesting. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You could make a few v very colourful ones, and uh a very traditional co cover.\nuser interface: Yeah, o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens. The yellow uh rubber telephone.\nindustrial designer: Yes. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: It's the it's the rubber uh cover.\nproject manager: Yeah, it is, it is i yeah.\nuser interface: And it's uh colourful.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It looks likes a banana. We have the fruit, we have the colours. We have the simple design.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you know the phone?\nindustrial designer: I don't know the phone,\nproject manager: It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five,\nindustrial designer: but I can imagine it.\nproject manager: I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away,\nuser interface: Um thirty five.\nindustrial designer: Oh, that one, yes.\nproject manager: the very \nuser interface: And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow.\nindustrial designer: Now I kn uh oh, I know, I know. Yes, I I've seen it. I've seen it.\nproject manager: You kn you know, Ruud, as well? About th\nmarketing: I've seen it,\nproject manager: Okay. Okay. Um uh\nmarketing: but \nproject manager: okay. Do you have  uh thit that was \nmarketing: 'Kay. Uh that's about it.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay, so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials.\nmarketing: Uh soft material.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So So ease of use is important, but technology is twice as important. And what was even more important?\nmarketing: Uh the fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: Okay. So that's the most important thing for our customers.\nmarketing: Yes. Apparently.\nproject manager: Okay, Roo,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: could you do your presentation?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Well, I don't ha really have much to add, um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion. Um \nproject manager: Okay, well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about.\nuser interface: Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume. Well, a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these. These are both with uh with voice recognition, but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um, well, a weird um shape.\nproject manager: Shape.\nuser interface: So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But it didn't work. My pen didn't load um the information. So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint. But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control. Uh yellow.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic, so that's very good.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And what I'm thinking about, maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt, too slippery,\nindustrial designer: Slippery.\nproject manager: s because um \nuser interface: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone, it's rubber.\nindustrial designer: You have to grab it.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\nuser interface: So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes. There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in,\nproject manager: Yeah, ex for your fingers, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so you can get a really good grip on it. So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it. It's it's a lot easier.\nproject manager: Yeah. It grips automatically. Yeah, {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So m Yes.\nproject manager: okay.\nindustrial designer: But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation.\nproject manager: Okay, good.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Great. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information, in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh, well, the the fancy colours and uh and so on, and still have the ease of use, because we have an easy interface. And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on.\nproject manager: Yeah. Way too much I think for our goal,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: So if you have the voice recognition, you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, b but I think we'll \nindustrial designer: Okay, but I'll I'll go into that,\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities. Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division, and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design. Uh these are the things we've looked at. And of course I used the web to uh find my information. About the casing, we have three different casing possibilities. We have the uncurved or flat case. Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box. I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing. We have uh a curved one. It's uh curved in two dimensions. You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form. So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape, which is curved in three dimension. I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation. The the big remote control, something like that.\nuser interface: Yeah. Right.\nuser interface: But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs? So if you use titanium {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No no, but the uh um that's what Sebastian said.\nindustrial designer: The titanium thing uh we have to skip it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference. But but yet, I understood that the market is different.\nuser interface: Okay. Oh,\nproject manager: So um \nuser interface: sorry. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and we should uh use wood or something like that.\nproject manager: No,\nuser interface: And I would think \nmarketing: And\nproject manager: r\nmarketing: yeah,\nproject manager: rubber with colours.\nmarketing: the yeah, the older people liked wood.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay, sorry. So it it needs to be rubber.\nmarketing: No the \nproject manager: Colourful and \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, the younger people liked soft material.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay, spongy materials.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay, um well um these scroll-wheels, I think uh they they can be they can be handy.\nuser interface: And they can be implemented with a regular chip?\nindustrial designer: So Yes, they can. But they really need the regular chip, you cannot use the sa simple \nuser interface: Okay, but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker \nindustrial designer: Well, I'm not very sure. Maybe that's an uh a different \nuser interface: oh,\nproject manager: But but do we want the curved uh uh design,\nuser interface: evalu\nproject manager: or \nindustrial designer: I think so, if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design, i uh it's too dull.\nproject manager: I it's too dull. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't think c our customers will like it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And um if you uh take the double-curved, uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels.\nproject manager: Yeah.

{"fname": "product_test_45", "dialogue": "industrial designer: And we of course have the traditional uh solar power, which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity. The user interface controls, um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels. And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons. So it's just like a mouse. You can scroll 'em, you can also push it. Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays, which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh and we also have double scroll-buttons, which are just two of these things. So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting, the the thing with the the round with the four \nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Oh, we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round.\nindustrial designer: Yes. That is possible too. Yes.\nuser interface:  But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels.\nproject manager: Well \nuser interface: I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it.\nindustrial designer: Well, mayb uh well, m me neither. Maybe when you integrate some functions.\nproject manager: This will be the remote, right?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um with uh maybe a channel selector. What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side?\nuser interface: Yeah, uh that's a possibility,\nindustrial designer: Uh it's do it's done before.\nproject manager: Because this is how you keep it \nuser interface: but \nindustrial designer: Yes. It's quite quite good, yes.\nuser interface: But Flores, think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for \nproject manager: Volume?\nindustrial designer: Well, it's it well, i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel.\nuser interface: A volume, okay.\nindustrial designer: There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel. You just use the wheel.\nproject manager: Well, what about mute?\nindustrial designer: About mute.\nproject manager: Thi i i m I guess uh th\nindustrial designer: Well, yes.\nproject manager: this is my volume button. And I can either on this side or this side um \nindustrial designer: Okay. Yes. Well, okay. Well, that that that's one possibility, okay.\nproject manager: And click it to muten the device.\nindustrial designer: Well, okay. It's quite goods.\nproject manager: And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market. So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yes.\nproject manager: So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh Ruud, wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar? Uh scroll-wheel.\nmarketing: Um Uh well,\nuser interface: Wheel.\nmarketing: it's obvious obviously new. So it might attract uh the young customers.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. But it's done before, uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio, pocket radios. We use this.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And Well, it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now.\nproject manager: Well, all the Sony telephones use it, for example, for volume.\nindustrial designer: So maybe it's not no .\nproject manager: Nokia has a well, okay, it's not really a scroll-wheel, but on their side th the the volume button is on the side, because you gri grab it like this.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yes, but it uses two separate buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah. I know, it's not really a scroll-wheel. No. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It doesn't use a . Well. Uh something for uh Roo here. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: For you too, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said, um the grip uh places in in the remote control. You have your hand on one place on the remote control, so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb.\nindustrial designer: Wi within reach. Yes, you have to.\nuser interface: So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect.\nindustrial designer: Yes. yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: Okay. Sebastian. Um \nindustrial designer: Okay, um we have to know, if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case, um you must use these push uh push-buttons. There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays. There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels, because it's all curved.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things. So that's a limitation. About um the components, uh just the hardware. We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal. Uh we have a simple, regular and advanced chip. And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker, which is a little cryptic uh to me. But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah, you can um I have some information about it. Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up. Of mute, let's say mute.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So so \nuser interface: Um you programme it, you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function\nindustrial designer: okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\nuser interface: and uh when you speak in the the remote control, it repeats uh your saying. that's the sample sensor. So So if you say mute, it says mute again,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: and then it's um well, I believe it's uh \nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: It performs the action. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So you say mute, he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute, and then goes to the mute function.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay, so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for. Okay. This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip, I thought. Um no op I'm not very sure. No, it's not in here. If we want to use the L_C_D_ display, we really need the advanced version, which is a bit l little bit more costly. If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version. And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip, which is a bit cheaper.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh well uh\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: d did we already decide on the display? To \nindustrial designer: Um no, but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well, I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it, but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: Especially when when we have to look at a cost, I don't think uh \nindustrial designer: I I don't think either.\nuser interface: 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen,\nindustrial designer: No. I don't think you need it.\nproject manager: On screen display. Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: Okay\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay, well\nproject manager: th\nproject manager: Okay, what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue. Because it it's of cour\nindustrial designer: Yes. It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's very unlogical.\nuser interface: But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all.\nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: Well the there has to be some pointing at. But \nproject manager: It depends also on your on your \nuser interface: Well, if you if you take your hand before it, okay, it won't work, but you can point it just to the other wall.\nproject manager: Well, it depends on your walls actually. If you have uh have um smooth walls, it it it probably you're probably right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: But if you have carpets on the wall, which our natural loving friends probably do have, then um yeah, th th it might be a bit more of a issue.\nindustrial designer: All lights get absorbed, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Yes, because the walls they they reflect the infrared light.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So it has an it's easier. Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample. Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um with a with a regular chip.\nuser interface: And the regular chip.\nindustrial designer: I think uh it gives us the advantage of \nuser interface: And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes, yes.\nproject manager: I like the scroll wheels uh idea.\nindustrial designer: And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't think it it's any uh value added thing.\nuser interface: No. Think so too.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Well, it looks uh yeah, well um\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: according to Ruud, the the the market likes um new flashy technology,\nindustrial designer: Technology.\nproject manager: and I mean L_C_D_ is \nindustrial designer: Yes.

Right, okay um, this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um, right our agenda for today, do you want us to give you a second?\nmarketing: Uh, no that's okay,\nproject manager: Okay, um {vocalsound}\nmarketing: sorry.\nproject manager: I'll go over what we decided last meeting,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: um, we decided upon a universal control, one handset for all, T_V_, video equipment.\nuser interface: Sorry.\nproject manager: Um, that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limiting anyone. We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product, we put fashion in electronics, you know that kind of s thing. Um, our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget, um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it, okay. Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um want it to look uncluttered, undaunting to the customer. We discussed a flip-open design, um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming, things like that. Okay. Um, three presentations, I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first?\nmarketing: Um is it okay if I postpone that til later, I just want to get access to a little bit more information,\nproject manager: No that's fine, that's fine. \nmarketing: is that okay?\nindustrial designer: Okay, yeah I'll go first. Can I grab the \nproject manager: Unplug me.\nindustrial designer: Thanks. What do I have to press? Oh, F_ eight?\nproject manager: Um, F_N_ function F_ eight.\nindustrial designer: Oh right, yeah. Okay. Maybe \nuser interface: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yep there we go. Okay this is uh the working design, presented by me, the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: 'Kay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so. What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel um or the volume, everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to. Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really. So um, yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use, wireless and, you don't need to send very much information. Um, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one, I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Could I can I interject to ask a question there,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah sure.\nmarketing: is that appropriate? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it?\nindustrial designer: Um no no, if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in.\nmarketing: Right, the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not, right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the the \nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: They are.\nindustrial designer: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption\nmarketing: Oh I see.\nindustrial designer: and how much you need to send the data across.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um, and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round. Um, now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work, uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose, we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine. And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: It's not a proper circuit, I'm not sure if it'd work or not, I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway, we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment. And then finally, um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good. Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about, uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have,\nmarketing: Mm. Mm.\nindustrial designer: I th that was just sort of a general point there.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: And that's uh yeah.\nmarketing: That's a very important part, it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that, whenever you like me to present.\nindustrial designer: Alright okay, and yeah, that's that's what I came up with there,\nproject manager: Okay, thank you very much.\nindustrial designer: so if you wanna \nproject manager: Um, would you like to continue on from that?\nuser interface: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Ooh.\nuser interface: 'Kay. It can be \nproject manager: Or, maybe move the laptop over.\nuser interface: okay, that's okay with me. further. \nproject manager: \nuser interface: Oops. Why's it not working? F_ eight, right?\nproject manager: F_ function.\nindustrial designer: Function F_ eight yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. Mm why's it in the right?\nmarketing: No. The plug hasn't come out at the bottom, has it? No.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's connecting .\nindustrial designer: No, no yeah it's just .\nmarketing: Meter adjusting.\nuser interface: okay.\nproject manager: Oh, there .\nuser interface: Yeah. Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um, I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable. So purpose, as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible. And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it, will this two features together. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user. As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said? Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also, so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. Um, that's so this is if you ask me personally, I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Uh any comments like, if you want?\nproject manager: 'Kay. Um, I think we'll chat about it at the end,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end, um \nindustrial designer: Yeah sure.\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Ooh, it's vibrating, that's strange. Oh, God. Right, okay.\nuser interface: I think you'll have to \nmarketing: Have I got to keep this here?\nuser interface: You can't \nmarketing: Does it matter?\nuser interface: It'll have to this can't be pulled.\nmarketing: I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I?\nproject manager: We just do the best we can.\nmarketing: Uh, whoops.\nuser interface: You'll have to push it a bit more.\nmarketing: Will it manage? Bit more,\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: oh dear. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah this is more than enough. Okay.\nindustrial designer: There we go, I've got a bit more of the cable.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: There we go.\nmarketing: Is that okay?\nuser interface: Yeah I think you can pull it out now.\nmarketing: Thank you,\nuser interface: \nmarketing: just pull it closer a little bit.\nindustrial designer: Uh you should be able to and \nproject manager: Yeah, you might.\nindustrial designer: yeah, there you go.\nmarketing: Get it right over, okay, thank you.\nproject manager: Ah. Look at that.\nmarketing: Okay, um, I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research. Um, so that's where we started, we used our our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, male and female, all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab, just their general use of the remote control, you can see we had a hundred subjects there. Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, so it has obvious design implications there. Um, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, we were quite surprised by that finding, but um that's quite a high proportion of our our, you know, international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Um, current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping. So again there's power implications there. Um, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, so again a big design issue there. Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier, uh remote controls are often lost in the room, it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing, uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons, they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Um, um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly. Um, that trend reverses in the older age groups. So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features, that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses, they're not so bothered with this. I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you,\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nmarketing: but I think I'll just keep it simple,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: if there's any more information I can email you extra details,\nuser interface: That's fine.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: is that okay?\nproject manager: Right, um\nindustrial designer: Huh.\nproject manager: we have new project requirements, um we're not going to be using teletext,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now. Um our control is only going to be for T_V_, it's not going to be a combined control, which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm, so can we not programme a video with this remote control?\nproject manager: It says for T_V_ only, so looks like it's just \nmarketing: Just channel-hopping.\nproject manager: yeah, I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know, what do you think? It just said, for T_V_ only. But I mean, general T_V_ controls do do video as well.\nmarketing: Would that imply video use?\nindustrial designer: T yeah yeah. I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g\nproject manager: I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. If yeah \nmarketing: Mm-hmm, yes.\nindustrial designer: and if you got if you got a Sky box, they have one of those plus boxes, you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so.\nproject manager: Mm. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming.\nuser interface: Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that?\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons,\nuser interface: Ten perc\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video, fast-forwarding, so on\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Pens\nindustrial designer: and they're not that great anyway.\nmarketing: In fact I've just called up that table there,\nindustrial designer: Alright, okay.\nmarketing: we asked those two questions, the table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate. Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen, that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control?\nindustrial designer: Alright, okay.\nmarketing: So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group, I think that's just general fear of new technology.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: bu\nmarketing: Oh yeah.\nindustrial designer: so I thought that could be quite a \nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose, you were saying whistling,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote, you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: and you're like oh okay it's over there, something like that,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yes. That's a super idea.\nproject manager: but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. Um so we want logo, we want um fashionable, trendy, I mean what you were talking about with the marketing. Um, people paying more for it to look good. Um, we need to focus on that as well.\nmarketing: Yes, further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African, I dunno,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: you get the idea. It's it's gonna vary around the world. At the end of the day, th the engineering design is one thing, it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So are we talking of a single model or maybe five, six designs?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Sure.\nindustrial designer: Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same.\nuser interface: Right.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: The features could be same and the body could look slightly different.\nindustrial designer: Just \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: What about you were talking about the buttons,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big, rubber buttons, not tiny little one, big, rubber buttons, but what about, I mean, 'cause we got to make it original, what about um you know with the touch screen computers\nindustrial designer: 'Kay. Yeah, yeah that's what I was just yeah.\nproject manager: yeah? Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either, not sure about the \nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: No, well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just \nproject manager: You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking uh young, um office people,\nmarketing: Mm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: trendy kind of a thing.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def\nproject manager: Um, but quite, um, easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations, um \nmarketing: Mm-hmm, mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm. But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs, ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big\nproject manager: Were too big.\nindustrial designer: because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others.\nuser interface: Yeah, uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use, the injuries, maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: So, a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups, you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also, the market.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small, yeah.\nproject manager: I think we have to design one product\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Huh.\nproject manager: and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: in the sense that they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly, um.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely.\nproject manager: It's gonna be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities, um.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm concerned, when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again, repetitive strain injury, I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough, I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that. Um, R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I'm j I really can't get my head round this one,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about.\nindustrial designer: I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel\nmarketing: Mm. I know, and it becomes ridiculous, yes I know.\nindustrial designer: and it becomes \nproject manager: Or a speech recognition,\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah, speech recognition,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: which is extremely expensive,\nindustrial designer: but \nproject manager: I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Yes. Mm-hmm. Do we have to initially um, you know looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Do we really have to go for everyone right away? Um.\nuser interface: We could focus on the biggest market.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market?\nindustrial designer: Ge uh \nmarketing: And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people, young people, trendy people.\nproject manager: We are we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well. That they want um it to be fashionable,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but I don't think we're focusing on that, I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um, business kind of class type people.\nmarketing: Mm. Mm. I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage, we want to, you know, not waste money, not be profligate\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up, first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this.\nproject manager: Okay, so the remote control functions. Um we've got the T_V_,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: we've got the video, now there's um I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details,\nindustrial designer: Video plus.\nproject manager: yes. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, is that \nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah.\nproject manager: I always found that really easy when I discovered it, um\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on, that's fine, but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to, you put the number in\nindustrial designer: Just whack in the number.\nproject manager: and it's just a number, it's not a date, it's not a time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that,\nindustrial designer: And you w {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it's just a number.\nindustrial designer: yeah. And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that,\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway,\nproject manager: You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Right, I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful.\nproject manager: It is\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: after um if you look in the newspaper, T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards\nindustrial designer: It's not Yeah.\nproject manager: and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth\nmarketing: Ah, hmm.\nproject manager: so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times,\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: um and it has been around for quite a long time.\nindustrial designer: It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things.\nproject manager: No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that \nmarketing: Superb. Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series.\nmarketing: Excellent, mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So that yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: But just to have that function would be would be really good.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Okay so \nmarketing: Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me, I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features, um, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: they'll phone the company, you can use their telephones.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out\nmarketing: Mm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having \nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it. Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing, it's not working, what should I do?\nmarketing: Alright. Yes\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel,\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video,\nproject manager: I think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I mean \nmarketing: we're not gonna put any okay, just a thought.\nproject manager: Um \nindustrial designer: I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that.\nproject manager: Instruction manuals. But I mean they're there's customer service,\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Department, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Sure.\nproject manager: and that way there's no call out charge, there's no extra, t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street, um.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Right.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that.\nindustrial designer: And they're \nmarketing: Not for such simple functions\nindustrial designer: yeah, they should be f yeah.\nmarketing: because we're focusing on that,\nproject manager: Mm. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible\nmarketing: yes okay.\nuser interface: Simple.\nproject manager: because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious, yes.\nproject manager: It does,\nindustrial designer: It's the uh \nproject manager: you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: and then you try and search through it, so that should be something we think about.\nmarketing: Sure, okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um, what other functions? We need I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now, but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries, that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that?\nindustrial designer: Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones, but they come with a charger, I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but \nproject manager: Well they la they they last quite a long time,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, something like that should reduce the size of it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh \nproject manager: Yeah it could be on that yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah on that as well so.\nuser interface: So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote?\nproject manager: S\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: some sort of docking station or \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Rechargeable with a docking station.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: So the rechargeable which would be your field.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time.\nuser interface: Right.\nproject manager: Yes,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: which it is cheaper in the long run as well.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, th the shape you got trendy. I don't wanna big box with lots of things, you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: um \nmarketing: And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical,\nproject manager: They do.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: these long, brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface. We definitely an ob an obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles, we don't want that.\nproject manager: Okay so we've got a flip-screen.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back. Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box, like a chocolate.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up, so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much, so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat.\nmarketing: Slightly curved, curved.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like. So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway.\nuser interface: y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your \nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom, something like that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth.\nproject manager: Can you look into the company logo? Um, things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product.\nuser interface: Current.\nproject manager: I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design,\nmarketing: \nproject manager: while also making it quite different from anything else that's there.\nuser interface: We could look in at that but Mm. What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells,\nmarketing: I mean look at the mobile.\nuser interface: logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model, rather than you know, trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like.\nproject manager: Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different.\nmarketing: I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea,\nuser interface: A sea shell?\nmarketing: I've not come across anything like that before, if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think. I think it's a really nice idea\nuser interface: Yeah we could look in at that.\nmarketing: and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior.\nproject manager: Or you could do um different, like you get with mobile phones, different fascias. You could have different kind of casings.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and \nmarketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Less chance of it being lost too, it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either. It's easier to bit nice to handle.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah maybe we could come at some say five, six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: that could be the most common design.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: But we can like think of five, six designs.\nproject manager: Okay. Right, I think we have to round it up, um \nmarketing: Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything.\nproject manager: Sure.\nmarketing: So it's no teletext, it's only for T_V_ and by implication video,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control, um something about Videoplus.\nproject manager: That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions, making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date \nmarketing: Right. Right. Right, so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_, a reminder about using Videoplus? So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements, is this just that was an add-on feature?\nproject manager: It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel, things like that.\nmarketing: Uh-huh. Right. Right, so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature?\nproject manager: Um it could be it c It yes,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: it could be uh adv advertisement feature, um rather than design feature,\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: you know, drawing attention to that. And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual, 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful.\nmarketing: Mm, and the rechargeable batteries.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements?\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: Yeah. \nproject manager: We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it, um.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. That's not at the moment a requirement, it's something we're looking at,\nproject manager: Yes. Yes.\nmarketing: what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like.\nproject manager: And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost, um.\nuser interface: For detection, right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible. But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual, I don't know if we deal with that, um. I think \nuser interface: Yep,\nproject manager: Yep,\nuser interface: I think \nproject manager: and different from what's out there. Yep, I think that's us.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: True.\nmarketing: What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting?\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved?\nproject manager: I think you might get guidance, but um I th Instruction manuals, 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing,\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: u um, they're everyone's got like a big pile of them, but no one really uses them.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Um.\nuser interface: Oops.\nmarketing: Whoops, questionnaire four.\nuser interface: We should f\nproject manager: Yes, right. Okay.\nuser interface: I think it's time for us to get back to \nmarketing: 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think.\nproject manager: Right, okay.

{"fname": "product_test_49", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Okay, yeah I'll go first. Can I grab the \nproject manager: Unplug me.\nindustrial designer: Thanks. What do I have to press? Oh, F_ eight?\nproject manager: Um, F_N_ function F_ eight.\nindustrial designer: Oh right, yeah. Okay. Maybe \nuser interface: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yep there we go. Okay this is uh the working design, presented by me, the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: 'Kay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so. What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel um or the volume, everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to. Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really. So um, yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use, wireless and, you don't need to send very much information. Um, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one, I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Could I can I interject to ask a question there,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah sure.\nmarketing: is that appropriate? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it?\nindustrial designer: Um no no, if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in.\nmarketing: Right, the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not, right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the the \nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: They are.\nindustrial designer: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption\nmarketing: Oh I see.\nindustrial designer: and how much you need to send the data across.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um, and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round. Um, now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work, uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose, we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine. And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: It's not a proper circuit, I'm not sure if it'd work or not, I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway, we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver, which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment. And then finally, um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good. Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base, we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about, uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have,\nmarketing: Mm. Mm.\nindustrial designer: I th that was just sort of a general point there.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: And that's uh yeah.\nmarketing: That's a very important part, it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that, whenever you like me to present.\nindustrial designer: Alright okay, and yeah, that's that's what I came up with there,\nproject manager: Okay, thank you very much.\nindustrial designer: so if you wanna \nproject manager: Um, would you like to continue on from that?\nuser interface: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Ooh.\nuser interface: 'Kay. It can be \nproject manager: Or, maybe move the laptop over.\nuser interface: okay, that's okay with me. further. \nproject manager: \nuser interface: Oops. Why's it not working? F_ eight, right?\nproject manager: F_ function.\nindustrial designer: Function F_ eight yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. Mm why's it in the right?\nmarketing: No. The plug hasn't come out at the bottom, has it? No.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's connecting .\nindustrial designer: No, no yeah it's just .\nmarketing: Meter adjusting.\nuser interface: okay.\nproject manager: Oh, there .\nuser interface: Yeah. Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um, I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable. So purpose, as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible. And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it, will this two features together. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user. As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said? Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also, so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. Um, that's so this is if you ask me personally, I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Uh any comments like, if you want?\nproject manager: 'Kay. Um, I think we'll chat about it at the end,\nuser interface: Okay.", "en_query": "What did the group discuss about battery issues and flip top design?", "zh_query": "开发团队就电池问题和翻盖设计展开了怎样的讨论?", "fr_query": "Qu’a dit le groupe concernant les problèmes de batterie et la conception du couvercle rabattable ?", "ukr_query": "Що група обговорювала про проблеми з батареями та дизайн відкидного верху?", "en_summary": "On battery issue, Industrial Designer expressed a desire to minimize the size of the battery.

{"fname": "product_test_51", "dialogue": "marketing: Okay, um, I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research. Um, so that's where we started, we used our our usability lab, the company's usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public, male and female, all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab, just their general use of the remote control, you can see we had a hundred subjects there. Our findings, lots of findings, I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls, so it has obvious design implications there. Um, we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, we were quite surprised by that finding, but um that's quite a high proportion of our our, you know, international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Um, current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping. So again there's power implications there. Um, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, so again a big design issue there. Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier, uh remote controls are often lost in the room, it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing, uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons, they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Um, um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly. Um, that trend reverses in the older age groups. So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features, that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses, they're not so bothered with this. I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you,\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nmarketing: but I think I'll just keep it simple,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: if there's any more information I can email you extra details,\nuser interface: That's fine.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: is that okay?\nproject manager: Right, um\nindustrial designer: Huh.\nproject manager: we have new project requirements, um we're not going to be using teletext,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now. Um our control is only going to be for T_V_, it's not going to be a combined control, which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm, so can we not programme a video with this remote control?\nproject manager: It says for T_V_ only, so looks like it's just \nmarketing: Just channel-hopping.\nproject manager: yeah, I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know, what do you think? It just said, for T_V_ only. But I mean, general T_V_ controls do do video as well.\nmarketing: Would that imply video use?\nindustrial designer: T yeah yeah. I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g\nproject manager: I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. If yeah \nmarketing: Mm-hmm, yes.\nindustrial designer: and if you got if you got a Sky box, they have one of those plus boxes, you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so.\nproject manager: Mm. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming.\nuser interface: Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that?\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons,\nuser interface: Ten perc\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video, fast-forwarding, so on\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Pens\nindustrial designer: and they're not that great anyway.\nmarketing: In fact I've just called up that table there,\nindustrial designer: Alright, okay.\nmarketing: we asked those two questions, the table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate. Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen, that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control?\nindustrial designer: Alright, okay.\nmarketing: So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group, I think that's just general fear of new technology.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: bu\nmarketing: Oh yeah.\nindustrial designer: so I thought that could be quite a \nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves, so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose, you were saying whistling,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote, you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: and you're like oh okay it's over there, something like that,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yes. That's a super idea.\nproject manager: but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. Um so we want logo, we want um fashionable, trendy, I mean what you were talking about with the marketing. Um, people paying more for it to look good. Um, we need to focus on that as well.\nmarketing: Yes, further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African, I dunno,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: you get the idea. It's it's gonna vary around the world. At the end of the day, th the engineering design is one thing, it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So are we talking of a single model or maybe five, six designs?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Sure.\nindustrial designer: Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same.\nuser interface: Right.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: The features could be same and the body could look slightly different.\nindustrial designer: Just \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: What about you were talking about the buttons,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big, rubber buttons, not tiny little one, big, rubber buttons, but what about, I mean, 'cause we got to make it original, what about um you know with the touch screen computers\nindustrial designer: 'Kay. Yeah, yeah that's what I was just yeah.\nproject manager: yeah? Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either, not sure about the \nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: No, well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just \nproject manager: You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking uh young, um office people,\nmarketing: Mm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: trendy kind of a thing.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def\nproject manager: Um, but quite, um, easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations, um \nmarketing: Mm-hmm, mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm. But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs, ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big\nproject manager: Were too big.\nindustrial designer: because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others.\nuser interface: Yeah, uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use, the injuries, maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: So, a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups, you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also, the market.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small, yeah.\nproject manager: I think we have to design one product\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Huh.\nproject manager: and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: in the sense that they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly, um.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same, yes, absolutely.\nproject manager: It's gonna be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities, um.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm concerned, when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again, repetitive strain injury, I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough, I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that. Um, R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I'm j I really can't get my head round this one,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about.\nindustrial designer: I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel\nmarketing: Mm. I know, and it becomes ridiculous, yes I know.\nindustrial designer: and it becomes \nproject manager: Or a speech recognition,\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah, speech recognition,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: which is extremely expensive,\nindustrial designer: but \nproject manager: I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Yes. Mm-hmm. Do we have to initially um, you know looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Do we really have to go for everyone right away? Um.\nuser interface: We could focus on the biggest market.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market?\nindustrial designer: Ge uh \nmarketing: And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people, young people, trendy people.\nproject manager: We are we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well. That they want um it to be fashionable,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Now with the baby boomers, the older generations are actually larger, they have a greater population than us young people,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but I don't think we're focusing on that, I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um, business kind of class type people.\nmarketing: Mm. Mm. I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage, we want to, you know, not waste money, not be profligate\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up, first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this.\nproject manager: Okay, so the remote control functions. Um we've got the T_V_,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: we've got the video, now there's um I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of programme details,\nindustrial designer: Video plus.\nproject manager: yes. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, is that \nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah.\nproject manager: I always found that really easy when I discovered it, um\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on, that's fine, but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to, you put the number in\nindustrial designer: Just whack in the number.\nproject manager: and it's just a number, it's not a date, it's not a time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that,\nindustrial designer: And you w {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it's just a number.\nindustrial designer: yeah. And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that,\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway,\nproject manager: You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Right, I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful.\nproject manager: It is\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: after um if you look in the newspaper, T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five, six digit number afterwards\nindustrial designer: It's not Yeah.\nproject manager: and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth\nmarketing: Ah, hmm.\nproject manager: so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times,\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: um and it has been around for quite a long time.\nindustrial designer: It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things.\nproject manager: No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that \nmarketing: Superb. Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series.\nmarketing: Excellent, mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So that yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: But just to have that function would be would be really good.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Okay so \nmarketing: Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me, I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features, um, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: they'll phone the company, you can use their telephones.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out\nmarketing: Mm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having \nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it. Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing, it's not working, what should I do?\nmarketing: Alright. Yes\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel,\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video,\nproject manager: I think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I mean \nmarketing: we're not gonna put any okay, just a thought.\nproject manager: Um \nindustrial designer: I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that.\nproject manager: Instruction manuals. But I mean they're there's customer service,\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Department, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Sure.\nproject manager: and that way there's no call out charge, there's no extra, t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street, um.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Right.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that.\nindustrial designer: And they're \nmarketing: Not for such simple functions\nindustrial designer: yeah, they should be f yeah.\nmarketing: because we're focusing on that,\nproject manager: Mm. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible\nmarketing: yes okay.\nuser interface: Simple.\nproject manager: because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious, yes.\nproject manager: It does,\nindustrial designer: It's the uh \nproject manager: you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: and then you try and search through it, so that should be something we think about.\nmarketing: Sure, okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um, what other functions? We need I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now, but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries, that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries, what kinda battery is that?\nindustrial designer: Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones, but they come with a charger, I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but \nproject manager: Well they la they they last quite a long time,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, something like that should reduce the size of it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh \nproject manager: Yeah it could be on that yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah on that as well so.\nuser interface: So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote?\nproject manager: S\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: some sort of docking station or \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Rechargeable with a docking station.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: So the rechargeable which would be your field.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time.\nuser interface: Right.\nproject manager: Yes,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: which it is cheaper in the long run as well.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um, th the shape you got trendy. I don't wanna big box with lots of things, you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: um \nmarketing: And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical,\nproject manager: They do.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: these long, brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface. We definitely an ob an obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles, we don't want that.\nproject manager: Okay so we've got a flip-screen.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back. Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box, like a chocolate.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up, so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much, so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing, curled up like a boat.\nmarketing: Slightly curved, curved.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like. So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway.\nuser interface: y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your \nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom, something like that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth.\nproject manager: Can you look into the company logo? Um, things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product.\nuser interface: Current.\nproject manager: I mean for example, if it was a C_ or something like that, you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell, or something,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design,\nmarketing: \nproject manager: while also making it quite different from anything else that's there.\nuser interface: We could look in at that but Mm. What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells,\nmarketing: I mean look at the mobile.\nuser interface: logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model, rather than you know, trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like.\nproject manager: Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different.\nmarketing: I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea,\nuser interface: A sea shell?\nmarketing: I've not come across anything like that before, if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think. I think it's a really nice idea\nuser interface: Yeah we could look in at that.\nmarketing: and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior.\nproject manager: Or you could do um different, like you get with mobile phones, different fascias. You could have different kind of casings.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and \nmarketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Less chance of it being lost too, it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either. It's easier to bit nice to handle.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah maybe we could come at some say five, six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: that could be the most common design.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: But we can like think of five, six designs.\nproject manager: Okay. Right, I think we have to round it up, um ", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion about market research and adjustments due to new project requirements.", "zh_query": "总结有关市场调研以及因新项目需求所进行的调整的讨论。", "fr_query": "Résumez la discussion sur les études de marché et les ajustements dus aux nouvelles exigences du projet.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте обговорення дослідження ринку та коригування у зв’язку з новими вимогами проекту.", "en_summary": "The market research presented by Marketing implicated that the remote control design was expected to be more stylish and less complicated.

{"fname": "product_test_52", "dialogue": "marketing: so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping. So again there's power implications there. Um, fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, so again a big design issue there. Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier, uh remote controls are often lost in the room, it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing, uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons, they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Um, um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light, possibly.

Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design,\nmarketing: \nproject manager: while also making it quite different from anything else that's there.\nuser interface: We could look in at that but Mm. What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells,\nmarketing: I mean look at the mobile.\nuser interface: logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model, rather than you know, trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like.\nproject manager: Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different.\nmarketing: I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea,\nuser interface: A sea shell?\nmarketing: I've not come across anything like that before, if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think. I think it's a really nice idea\nuser interface: Yeah we could look in at that.\nmarketing: and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior.\nproject manager: Or you could do um different, like you get with mobile phones, different fascias. You could have different kind of casings.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and \nmarketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

{"fname": "product_test_55", "dialogue": "project manager: Hi everyone, hope you had a nice lunch. Um.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Alright we're moving on to conceptual design.\nuser interface: 'Scuse me. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Bless you.\nproject manager: Um, I'll just review what we did in our last meeting. Um, under marketing we targeted our audience, and Um, yeah. That was generally how helpful that was.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um, then we considered some design options with how it should look, um, we discussed an iPod-like button system which, uh, we haven't concluded but we're Right, um So, if you all have presentations to do, we can see what where you've come from our last time. Does everyone have presentations?\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: Would anybody like to go first?\nindustrial designer: Sure.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So I've been looking at the components design. Um. Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting. Um, so we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard. Um, I assume we'll be custom designing our case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case, to protect the remote and the locator. And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board, because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time. But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out. Um, standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, um the iPod-style wheel. The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it. Um, we need a radio sender and receiver, those are standard. And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. So we have some material options. Um, we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. Um, I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy. Um, and the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we shouldn't have a rubber case.\nproject manager: And why not wood?\nindustrial designer: And,\nproject manager: And why not wood? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: hmm? Uh, well we can use wood. I don't know why we'd want to. Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button, it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip. We can't use the minimal chip, we need the next higher grade, which is called regular. I don't think it's much more expensive, but it is more expensive. So that's what I've got on design.\nproject manager: 'S good.\nmarketing: Um, can I do next? 'Cause I have to say something about the material\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: which is quite shocking.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ha. Mm. Right, um, I have been searching the current trends, um, both on the web and via fashion-watchers, and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh, fancy look and feel. Um. Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. And th last thing is the easy to use um factor. Um, fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing, but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use. Um, our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want, you know, wh whatever our motto is. Um. For fashion, we go for fashion.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: The fashion in electronics. So we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel, so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer. As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be, should discuss this together, I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go. Um. I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but that's just a personal opinion.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed, so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um, and finally again with the spongy. It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine. Um, yeah, to summarise these are the points that need to be um, touched in order to get a good decision, and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Thank you for your attention.\nuser interface: So.\nproject manager: I think it's the next it's the blue one, yeah.\nuser interface: Oh, uh, there we go. Uh. Okay. Um. Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and and uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Neither was I. Well it's a trend in fashion, in clothing and um fabrics. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So so okay, let me get this right. Okay, uh Okay, alright anyway. Um here we go. Conceptual User Interface. Trying we're gonna try to talk about, um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And, um, basically, so, this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system. Uh, so people are going to be looking at this little screen. Um, kind of I mean I assume, are we still on the screen idea?\nproject manager: Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time.\nuser interface: 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel\nproject manager: You need a screen for it?\nuser interface: you it seems like you would need a screen.\nindustrial designer: You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song, like you know that band or whatever. With T_V_ channels it's, you know, one two three. So \nuser interface: But like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay. So, b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that, aren't you?\nproject manager: We're, um, we're actually not having D_V_D_,\nuser interface: Are we \nproject manager: that was one of th I I was \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: sorry,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I I meant to update you on that. Um.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Alright. Okay.\nmarketing: But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said.\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That correct?\nuser interface: So anyway if well we just we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay. So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? And you're just gonna I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right.\nmarketing: Graphical interface?\nuser interface: Yeah like you're g\nmarketing: Uh on the you can have it on the telly though.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that, I guess. But like choose channel control, like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like, um, you know, channels one two three four five six seven eight nine.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So that  people seems to be well \nproject manager: You've Yeah, I know what you're saying, you have to \nuser interface: You know. But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels. So um I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or \nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: But but imagine someone with s\nindustrial designer: My flatmates actually had one with a wheel, and it it did show up on the T_V_.\nuser interface: I oh yeah?\nproject manager: But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels. Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: 'Cause you'll have to like \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: They have to r wheel really fast.\nuser interface: but you can quickly s you can {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: at least on theirs.\nuser interface: Yeah if you do, it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel, and um So you're either you're you know, th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that, you know, you can like tap for, um, different\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: uh, whatchamacallits, different um, you know, functions like volume or, like you can tap just to get to different channels. Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth\nproject manager: Right.\nuser interface: And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, or if you want to um you know switch around, I don't know, like, these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that,\nproject manager: Yeah I mean with that many options, you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better,\nuser interface: like \nproject manager: because you could have that menu option, sort of \nuser interface: I would think so too, like So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it, you know, because \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that, like, is just there and you're not really using it, that's kind of \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's more expensive according to the design people.\nuser interface: m yeah.\nproject manager: Uh. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, that's the only thing though.\nindustrial designer: You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal.\nuser interface: Yeah. So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing, um \nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: You can get to you know, you can Like maybe it'll be that central button that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and you can just scroll around, like, to do the timer, to do the \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So the T_V_ is the screen, that yeah\nuser interface: yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: So it would have all these different options of changing\nuser interface: Yeah. But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up.\nproject manager: to \nmarketing: Look it even has settings.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Hmm?\nmarketing: On the \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: you can just take theirs and just {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, well we don't want the screen I guess,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: but um 'cause that just it does seem like, it that would be, like, incredibly expensive, but I dunno, and then so, it just im really all you need is, like, this little wheel then, and you can control everything.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: Um, right. What if I mean, if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the a you know, physical attributes,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: um, and you just have this, it's like just a long silver thing,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: or whatever we're thinking. I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? Or \nuser interface: It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_.\nproject manager: Yeah. So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before. I mean \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah definitely.\nproject manager: okay.\nuser interface: Like, I think we're looking at something that could be, like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I mean it it needs to be easy to \nmarketing: Yeah but should be comfortable.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I mean how do how do I'm not really Like when I use an iPod, I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it. So \nproject manager: Yeah, I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb, yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Or your thumb or something. So \nmarketing: Yeah I use it like that.\nindustrial designer: W when we had the wheely remote control, we it was on the top I think, if you held it like that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But, were there buttons on there as well?\nuser interface: Yeah, so \nindustrial designer: Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do.\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So we just used the top part.\nuser interface: Mm yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so but I mean I think it could be pretty small.\nmarketing: Uh.\nuser interface: Like, I d I mean, you you want it to be large enough that you can \nproject manager: What if, um, you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? Like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it.\nuser interface: But can't you just get \nproject manager: Do do you know what I'm talking about though? Like, uh, yeah just something \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of \nuser interface: K\nmarketing: Well you can have it on the settings,\nproject manager: Yeah, that you can flip over, yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: no?\nuser interface: Yeah, But, I mean, do you need that? If if you can get to, you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen.\nproject manager: Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: is is if w I \nuser interface: That keeps it\nproject manager: if we can do this, that'd probably be \nuser interface: really Yeah. Uh you wouldn't I don't I just don't think you would even need it.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: So I guess we have to look into the, um, like, the programming, how this how they actually programme these things, and if that's \nuser interface: Mean \nindustrial designer: Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_?\nproject manager: yeah. I mean it would y would that would be \nindustrial designer: I don't know.\nuser interface: I mean you can do it,\nmarketing: They already do it.\nindustrial designer: I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_, not inside the remote.\nuser interface: you it's it doesn't seem that hard. I mean I've never bought a remote.\nindustrial designer: I'm not sure.\nuser interface: It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well they usually are.\nuser interface: which is a little \nindustrial designer: Well \nuser interface: My I've never bought just a remote, like, so I don't I don't really know.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Huh.\nuser interface: But um \nindustrial designer: I guess that's right. It always comes with the T_V_. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So, um but I mean it's I've never had a hard time with like my remotes, like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever, you know. And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button, 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something. 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Well so So, do we need I dunno. Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That's what it does anyway.\nmarketing: But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out, because the problem with buttons is you like, they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you don't know they mean, yeah, it's like \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and I never get it.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Never ever.\nuser interface: So, but \nmarketing: So \nuser interface: oh, you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen?\nmarketing: Well on the telly.\nindustrial designer: Or on the T_V_ too.\nuser interface: On the telly, okay, yeah. So yeah I think, I mean, I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know, you have your little guide out and you're like, hit this button twice, like to activate the date.\nproject manager: Mm. And it is technologically innovative in a way,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: so that fits with the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. I guess. And it is trendy, the iPods are really hot right now, so \nproject manager: B Yeah.\nmarketing: Did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web?\nuser interface: Um, yeah, by web research, yeah, so \nmarketing: That's quite interesting. What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh god. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh, I was gonna say.\nuser interface: Oh.\nindustrial designer: You said uh people want spongy.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um, one of your \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things. So, that would be spongy.\nuser interface: Oh, okay, that would be cool.\nproject manager: Ah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Just nice feel, but I hate spongy.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, c that's e that would be kind of oh, you know, usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type, you know, thing.\nproject manager: Yeah. I mean definitely the area round it.\nuser interface: But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so you're like {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think it could work.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: we somehow made it tactilely fash you know, we c tapped into that, so like it feels like\nindustrial designer: Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana.\nuser interface: a vegetable. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover.\nproject manager: An orange. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: If it's a small thing, you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: which frankly I'm not particularly fond of,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles.\nindustrial designer: You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine and they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. You could name it after fruits and vegetables, or \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And it could the colour can fit your sitting room,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry, and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know. Um.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So what if what\nuser interface: So I think \nproject manager: this is \nuser interface: yeah, colours.\nproject manager: I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking. If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand, so like what you're feeling is comfortable, and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Is that kind of \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I do I dunno. Um \nproject manager: I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the \nmarketing: Maybe a ball.\nproject manager: A ball?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Know, a squashy ball.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: A relaxing squashy ball. That you can p\nuser interface: That's in the shape of a fruit, like a \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: well I see you're thinking, it's weird, you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um sticker sort of? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, like a \nproject manager: This is just Okay. Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit. Squashy.\nmarketing: Oh, okay, yeah. Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That see I was thinking this s\nmarketing: Which is cheaper.\nproject manager: sorry \nmarketing: Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually.\nproject manager: I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing.\nindustrial designer: Oh. Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there.\nuser interface: Oh I like that shape.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um but \nindustrial designer: I was thinking sort of a single ball shape.\nproject manager: I was thinking if it was like this \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So you're holding a squishy ball\nproject manager: 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy \nindustrial designer: and then it has a Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: It's like it has to be s\nproject manager: It's almost like your thumb is farther up,\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: so if if you could squish it lower then \nindustrial designer: Yeah I guess so.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. So it wouldn't be very big in either like how big? This big, and then you just do that, I suppose.\nproject manager: Yeah, I know what you meant, yeah.\nuser interface: What if, yeah, what if the squishy, oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable, and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing, and then you could have like the banana squishy thing {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and you could get you could have your choice, you know?\nmarketing: Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy, like a a cover.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But well the question is, which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that,\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Oh.\nmarketing: Um. That's nicer. I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Hmm. Well that's not very neat, but \nmarketing: Um.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. I mean I think uh and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part.\nmarketing: If it's a bit like those juggling balls, you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you could squish it.\nmarketing: If it's got sand in it maybe, or something, you it it just moulds to your hand.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. So where are the fruit and vegetables now?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front, or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath.\nuser interface: Fruits and veg.\nmarketing: We we don't know. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: And the rest is the company the company colour's silver?\nproject manager: It was, yeah, silver and yellow. It l it looks like I don't \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We could promote the banana one.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Like mm.\nproject manager: I mean that's another question, where are we gonna we we should have the logo somewhere on it.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Should also fit the batteries, which we haven't \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case.\nuser interface: Oh yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, th and that would that \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Especially if you're switching out the squishy part. Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think, um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit. The part that you, yeah, can change into the different, you know, trendy vegetables and fruits.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But uh it \nindustrial designer: Well I dunno. You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand. Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: No but it does it automatically.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Does it automatically?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't know.\nproject manager: I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But if someone \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: components concept. Question mark. Energy. Question mark.\nindustrial designer: That was me.\nproject manager: Was that you?\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Okay. Oh right right. Yeah. Um, so what d but what do we know about energy? I mean we're gonna use batteries right? And \nindustrial designer: Uh we actually had an option of batteries, solar power, and um a dynamo,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: which is something I don't know what it is. Something to do with torches.\nmarketing: Oh, a dynamo is ah, it's a bicycle. It's a bicycle mechanism. It's the en it's like if if something moves, when it moves, it stores energy.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay. Yeah, the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So I sort of picked battery.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's quite sweet.\nindustrial designer: We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power. Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways.\nproject manager: I think batteries sound good.\nindustrial designer: It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways.\nproject manager: What does everyone else think? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The dynamo would be interesting.\nmarketing: No. But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is, the moment you move it, it c it creates energy on its own.\nproject manager: What about Kryptonite? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh.\nmarketing: Which is quite cool. So if you throw it, it's gonna store loads of energy, and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying. But we need to find cost.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Don't know the cost.\nindustrial designer: Didn't have enough data to actually \nmarketing: Does anyone have costs on the on the web?\nindustrial designer: All it said was it gave sort of relative, some chips are more expensive than others, sort of things. It didn't give me any actual cost.\nmarketing: Okay. Right.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk. So I don't think it's that much of a problem. Like the chip is probably the most expensive part.\nproject manager: What does chip on print mean?\nindustrial designer: Um, for things like remote controls, um, they stamp out a chip,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: calculators too I think. Um, so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: But it's not like a computer, you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls, it's like stamped onto the chip.\nproject manager: Right. So, chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. And case? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about,\nindustrial designer: Case is what we were discussing yeah.\nproject manager: yeah. Casing. Yeah. thinking of like syntactic case and thi\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: um let's see. Is there anything else we need to\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: talk about? Oh when we move on, you two are going to be playing with play-dough.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um, and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design. And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation. So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach.\nmarketing: Oh, thank you. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Cool.\nproject manager: See you soon. Does it matter that I end early?\nmarketing: I it's strange because \nproject manager: How how early is it?

{"fname": "product_test_56", "dialogue": "marketing: Ha. Mm. Right, um, I have been searching the current trends, um, both on the web and via fashion-watchers, and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh, fancy look and feel. Um. Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. And th last thing is the easy to use um factor. Um, fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing, but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use. Um, our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided, well noticed, that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want, you know, wh whatever our motto is. Um. For fashion, we go for fashion.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: The fashion in electronics. So we want to put the fashion electronics, we need to go fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel, so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer. As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be, should discuss this together, I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go. Um. I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but that's just a personal opinion.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed, so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um, and finally again with the spongy. It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine. Um, yeah, to summarise these are the points that need to be um, touched in order to get a good decision, and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Thank you for your attention.\nuser interface: So.\nproject manager: I think it's the next it's the blue one, yeah.\nuser interface: Oh, uh, there we go. Uh. Okay. Um. Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and and uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Neither was I. Well it's a trend in fashion, in clothing and um fabrics. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's quite interesting. What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh god. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh, I was gonna say.\nuser interface: Oh.\nindustrial designer: You said uh people want spongy.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um, one of your \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things. So, that would be spongy.\nuser interface: Oh, okay, that would be cool.\nproject manager: Ah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Just nice feel, but I hate spongy.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, c that's e that would be kind of oh, you know, usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type, you know, thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.

Um. Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting. Um, so we need some custom design parts, and other parts we'll just use standard. Um, I assume we'll be custom designing our case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case, to protect the remote and the locator. And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board, because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time. But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out. Um, standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, um the iPod-style wheel. The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it. Um, we need a radio sender and receiver, those are standard. And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. So we have some material options. Um, we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. Um, I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy. Um, and the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we shouldn't have a rubber case.\nproject manager: And why not wood?\nindustrial designer: And,\nproject manager: And why not wood? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: hmm? Uh, well we can use wood. I don't know why we'd want to. Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button, it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip. We can't use the minimal chip, we need the next higher grade, which is called regular. I don't think it's much more expensive, but it is more expensive.

Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and and uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Neither was I. Well it's a trend in fashion, in clothing and um fabrics. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So so okay, let me get this right. Okay, uh Okay, alright anyway. Um here we go. Conceptual User Interface. Trying we're gonna try to talk about, um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control, based on fruit vegetable design.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And, um, basically, so, this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system. Uh, so people are going to be looking at this little screen. Um, kind of I mean I assume, are we still on the screen idea?\nproject manager: Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time.\nuser interface: 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel\nproject manager: You need a screen for it?\nuser interface: you it seems like you would need a screen.\nindustrial designer: You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song, like you know that band or whatever. With T_V_ channels it's, you know, one two three. So \nuser interface: But like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay. So, b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that, aren't you?\nproject manager: We're, um, we're actually not having D_V_D_,\nuser interface: Are we \nproject manager: that was one of th I I was \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: sorry,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I I meant to update you on that. Um.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Alright. Okay.\nmarketing: But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said.\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That correct?\nuser interface: So anyway if well we just we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay. So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? And you're just gonna I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right.\nmarketing: Graphical interface?\nuser interface: Yeah like you're g\nmarketing: Uh on the you can have it on the telly though.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that, I guess. But like choose channel control, like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like, um, you know, channels one two three four five six seven eight nine.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So that  people seems to be well \nproject manager: You've Yeah, I know what you're saying, you have to \nuser interface: You know. But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels. So um I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or \nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: But but imagine someone with s\nindustrial designer: My flatmates actually had one with a wheel, and it it did show up on the T_V_.\nuser interface: I oh yeah?\nproject manager: But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels. Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: 'Cause you'll have to like \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: They have to r wheel really fast.\nuser interface: but you can quickly s you can {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: at least on theirs.\nuser interface: Yeah if you do, it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel, and um So you're either you're you know, th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that, you know, you can like tap for, um, different\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: uh, whatchamacallits, different um, you know, functions like volume or, like you can tap just to get to different channels. Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth\nproject manager: Right.\nuser interface: And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television, or if you want to um you know switch around, I don't know, like, these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that,\nproject manager: Yeah I mean with that many options, you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better,\nuser interface: like \nproject manager: because you could have that menu option, sort of \nuser interface: I would think so too, like So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it, you know, because \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that, like, is just there and you're not really using it, that's kind of \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's more expensive according to the design people.\nuser interface: m yeah.\nproject manager: Uh. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, that's the only thing though.\nindustrial designer: You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal.\nuser interface: Yeah. So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing, um \nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: You can get to you know, you can Like maybe it'll be that central button that, like, then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and you can just scroll around, like, to do the timer, to do the \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So the T_V_ is the screen, that yeah\nuser interface: yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: So it would have all these different options of changing\nuser interface: Yeah. But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up.\nproject manager: to \nmarketing: Look it even has settings.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Hmm?\nmarketing: On the \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: you can just take theirs and just {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, well we don't want the screen I guess,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: but um 'cause that just it does seem like, it that would be, like, incredibly expensive, but I dunno, and then so, it just im really all you need is, like, this little wheel then, and you can control everything.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So ", "en_query": "What did people decide on screen usage when discussing the necessity of screen?", "zh_query": "在讨论屏幕是否有必要时，开发团队对屏幕的使用做出了什么决定？", "fr_query": "Qu'ont décidé les gens sur l'utilisation de l'écran lorsqu'ils ont discuté de la nécessité d'un écran ?", "ukr_query": "Що люди вирішили з приводу використання екрану, обговорюючи необхідність екрану?", "en_summary": "User Interface assumed they were going to have a screen at first, since User Interface thought a screen was necessary for people to visualize things such as a specific song when looking for one.

I don't have to put it in the report.\nuser interface: Are we doing the the speech recognition? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well.\nproject manager: Okay, but it's still possible uh uh financially. So if you want to, it's okay.\nuser interface: Okay yeah. Well then then we're gonna put it in.\nproject manager: Okay, just \nuser interface: Yeah, just uh we have to design the inside then, but it should be uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah, and Or are we making a slide open, like underneath? Or fold open? I don't know.\nproject manager: Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls.\nindustrial designer: It's probably better. Yeah, s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions.\nuser interface: It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well.\nproject manager: Maybe that's better. Yeah, that's that's a very good point.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay, so when you have a lot of room inside.\nindustrial designer: Think that's better.\nuser interface: So you can make it very easy to use. 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay. So this is okay? \nuser interface: No. Yeah, we're gonna use the advanced chip then.\nproject manager: Okay, so that's Uh I'll just have a look how much that is.\nindustrial designer: The \nproject manager: But um Okay, for the \nuser interface: Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I I think so. I don't know.\nproject manager: No, you have a different chip for speech recognition. So \nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Ah okay.\nproject manager: So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget. So it's okay.\nuser interface: Good.\nproject manager: So you can show your prototype if you want to.\nuser interface: Together?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, it's Let's do it together.\nuser interface: I'll give comments.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Yeah, we just made a Word file with the basic elements. Uh the look-and-feel model. Uh well the form, the case um as drawn there. Simply a square with uh round corners. So that's basically it. Uh the material should be hard plastic. Uh colour changeable, and also transparent.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: And colour and transparent, or just transparent, I don't know. Um then the elements. Uh we have The functions are just basic. Like uh I've pointed them here. Mute function, on-off function, text functions. This uh switch channel.\nproject manager: Okay, cool. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And this is the the num-pad. And the logo is over here, and the mic.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And the scrollwheel, no? You operate that with your pointing finger.\nmarketing: Means \nindustrial designer: So you hold it like this in your right hand and \nproject manager: Mm. So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Speech recognition.\nproject manager: Yeah, speech recognition. Just Only one button to say it's on or off.\nuser interface: Um I didn't have a specification of that. But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something.\nindustrial designer: Uh I dunno.\nuser interface: Um so I've \nindustrial designer: Yeah, maybe maybe uh you have to configure it.\nuser interface: Yes, you need options to configure it, and after that you don't need 'em anymore.\nproject manager: So you can put it on the back as well if you want to.\nuser interface: Yeah, you can put 'em all on the back. That's for sure.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, or or on the slide function, I don't know.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: That's uh \nindustrial designer: Well we haven't had time to design that, the slide pad.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: We also don't know how many buttons are required, or what kind of buttons. But You have a lot of room if you can slide it open.\nproject manager: Yeah, you can put it separate.\nuser interface: You Yeah I know. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. So But it's enough room.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Um the position? Yeah, you write uh \nuser interface: Uh well \nindustrial designer: You wrote this, so.\nuser interface: Well the main, the main zap buttons are most central. That was the the most important thing.\nmarketing: \nuser interface: So uh the best place, the best reach place Um on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are, easy to find. Um the on-off button is a bit bigger, uh so it stands out. That way you don't have to make it red, 'cause it's will uh will show up. Uh scrollwheel is on the left side. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But it's not uh impossible to use it, if you're left handed. So y Because you can use your thumb then.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Just just one thing now. Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine.\nuser interface: Okay yeah, they \nmarketing: But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes.\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. That's that's below that then.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: It's uh twelve buttons.\nindustrial designer: just so you get that.\nmarketing: Okay, but It's rather important. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah okay, just we just missed that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: But um I'll just uh I'll get back to later. F the form well, we've taken that from the iPod, other popular technical device. So um should be popular. Um The f uh the buttons creating? Uh if you That or all round shapes, not uh rounded corners.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So that, you know, you get a bit round feeling. Um we'll use hard plastic. Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons, uh non-rubber buttons. Colour changeable. Well and um the backlight thing, the thing that lights up. We have decided uh in the the channel buttons, there's a little uh colour around it.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: And also in the num-pads, there's also colour light behind it.\nproject manager: And do you still can, do you still can choose what colour, kind of colour you want?\nuser interface: So when you pre Yeah.\nproject manager: How do you want to implement that? Just on the Maybe on the second level as well?\nuser interface: We're going to implement. Yeah. Mm just a little \nindustrial designer: Yeah, these are just basic functions, so \nmarketing: Ah.\nindustrial designer: All the non-basic are in \nproject manager: Okay, just draw draw the second level, because we need that as well.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um \nmarketing: Okay, there is one uh function I use uh daily, and it's not on the basic functions. It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart. Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player.\nindustrial designer: Okay, maybe we use this button for the \nmarketing: That function must be Yeah, maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nproject manager: Yeah, as well.\nuser interface: I um \nproject manager: Just make make a \nuser interface: To your video device.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: A second level?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Like a a new blank one or Or just here?\nproject manager: No no, just on Down there.\nuser interface: Is i Ah okay.\nproject manager: So uh \nindustrial designer: Okay. Yeah.\nmarketing: And h how does the second level come out?\nproject manager: Just uh if you s\nmarketing: Uh it slides uh along?\nuser interface: Um slides I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, y Maybe, yeah.\nuser interface: It's\nmarketing: From from the uh beneath?\nproject manager: For the bottom.\nuser interface: You can do it that it claps open, but I think that's not solid enough.\nproject manager: No, you gotta slide it.\nuser interface: If that breaks then you're screwed.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's right.\nuser interface: So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open. Um \nindustrial designer: So what do we need?\nuser interface: Uh i the the speech functions buttons.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just \nmarketing: Menu?\nuser interface: Menu button. With uh maybe uh arrows. So you can uh\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: scroll in the, navigate the menu. Um \nindustrial designer: God damn it.\nmarketing: Scart?\nuser interface: I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels.\nmarketing: Uh yeah. And so y you keep you keep one, you have one left. Yes. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you have one left for the Right, the video channel, Play Station, etcetera. That's used pretty often.\nindustrial designer: So this is the \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: If you have a Play Station, mm you use it every day.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: It's a f basic uh \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Extern or something.\nuser interface: \nproject manager: You want to save that file as well? The drawing?\nuser interface: That was it.\nindustrial designer: So here are multiple speech buttons, I don't know how many.\nuser interface: Uh \nproject manager: Doesn't really matter. Just just uh \nuser interface: It doesn't really matter.\nindustrial designer: I don't know the functions.\nuser interface: That's Yeah well we don't have any uh \nindustrial designer: Okay. What else?\nuser interface: Hmm?\nindustrial designer: What else?\nuser interface: What else? Uh menu buttons with arrows.\nindustrial designer: Uh menu.\nmarketing: Yeah, to navigate.\nuser interface: S Just uh like \nindustrial designer: Uh With arrows.\nuser interface: Um I think it's best if we do. Mm where do we have Or there.\nindustrial designer: Like a normal um \nuser interface: Like on the normal uh Like this.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, with in the middle um a menu button.\nuser interface: The menu button, yes.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well we don't have any, anything on how many buttons speech requires. So you can't redesign it.\nmarketing: Mm okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Uh and and you can hold it,\nproject manager: \nmarketing: you can hold it, and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Just press it once, the colour should uh switch. Press again, the colour switch again maybe?\nmarketing: okay.\nproject manager: Or we just make it three buttons, all the colours on it. Just red, yel uh red, green and \nmarketing: Okay, yeah. Th Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: If we have enough place, uh then we can do that.\nproject manager: That's that's very easy, yeah.\nindustrial designer: We can put those here.\nmarketing: Colour buttons. And then we choose green, uh blue and red or\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. That's uh Um \nindustrial designer: So did we miss anything?\nuser interface: Yeah, maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel, that it is volume.\nmarketing: It Some text uh buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, but\nproject manager: No, ma on on o on the on the \nuser interface: I just uh The volume logo.\nmarketing: there's one there's one text button I \nindustrial designer: Oh wh Here?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. \nproject manager: Just make it \nindustrial designer: Okay. Yeah, or th or the \nmarketing: There's one text button I prefer. That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page, uh like seven hundred, uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred, you will switch to your television and back to text.\nuser interface: Yeah, we have that on the the text button.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Do you do you \nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: Did you think of that?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext. You just switch it off and then \nuser interface: Uh why not?\nproject manager: Yeah, just put it on those extra f extra function as well.\nmarketing: Ex Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: No Whoa \nindustrial designer: Well w we thought of a text button. And if you press it again, you get the the the\nuser interface: I think um \nmarketing: The sta the state you \nproject manager: Oh just three stages, you \nindustrial designer: through view.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, the three stages. Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, b but but if you're in the second stage, the third stage is switch teletext off.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So you can switch back from second to w first.\nuser interface: No, it doesn't have to turn it off. Just don't \nmarketing: No. Just remember where it was.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page. If you if you turn teletext on, you you set the seven hundred, and you turn it off, then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on seven hundred?\nproject manager: Yes, that's to remember.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, but that's that's uh \nmarketing: But maybe it's not the way \nuser interface: I dunno if \nproject manager: That's a functionality for the television. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, I think as well, but Uh yeah.\nmarketing: Mm. That's maybe one thing we can discuss about.\nindustrial designer: Yeah mm nee uh No, if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred, page seven hundred to the television. Th th th if you switch it on.\nuser interface: Yeah, in thi the the remote control in the\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah, but you have to search every time again.\nuser interface: the chip.\nindustrial designer: Th i\nproject manager: That's what what happening if you do it like that. But it's still the television that has to do that.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's true.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I dunno. Okay.\nuser interface: So yeah. Um do we need to fix that or \nproject manager: No, that's what the television does.\nmarketing: Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, those memory functions.\nmarketing: But uh not not every every television, so \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, it's cool.\nindustrial designer: Was uh this logo for uh volume?\nproject manager: Yeah, that's fine.\nindustrial designer: Okay. So that's it?\nproject manager: Is this prich pretty much it, yeah?\nmarketing: Yeah, I I thought about one thing. Uh the buttons? Uh from which material are they now?\nindustrial designer: Mm. No no\nuser interface: Just like your telephone, hard plastic.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Just hard plastic. So \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway.\nmarketing: Because um if you use it a couple of years, some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away, are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons?\nuser interface: I think just on the buttons.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think just um \nuser interface: If you do it abo above or below, it takes uh more space.\nmarketing: Well yeah. That's too much place.\nuser interface: I don't think the space is worth it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but \nmarketing: Okay, just leave it. Just leave it.\nindustrial designer: I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons.\nmarketing: Yeah, and i The most time Yeah, with rubber buttons. Yeah, okay. Okay. Fine.\nproject manager: Yeah? Okay, cool. Mm mm mm mm mm. Yeah, I don't know what this means. But I think we just evela evaluated this one.\nmarketing: Yeah, I made some criteria uh, so we can uh ev evaluate our model.\nproject manager: Oh okay, you made some criteria. Okay, cool. Okay.\nmarketing: I d d d I don't think if it's right. That shall show it.\nproject manager: You have some usability criteria or \nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Uh no, uh all criterias we just argue about. Uh \nindustrial designer: In the bottom.\nmarketing: Oh.\nproject manager: Look-and-feel?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: No, evaluation is \nmarketing: Evaluation crit Yeah, evaluation presentation. It's not in. Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pages or something. Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy, or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market. The Italians uh, how they think about it. And The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff. I made some criteria, and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. We sh we we we can give it uh a number, and then we can give ourself an average for our\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: um model.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: And this These are all I I I found, or I wrote down. And um we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven.\nproject manager: Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea. It quite beautiful.\nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: It's \nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: We are actu We are the \nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something. And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff.\nproject manager: Flashy.\nuser interface: Okay. Well I think we do \nmarketing: The LEDs.\nuser interface: If it's really uh, if you can if you can get the iPod look, then it's beautiful, I think.\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: But uh \nmarketing: And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of?\nindustrial designer: Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste.\nuser interface: Hmm?\nmarketing: The basic colours are black or green or yellow?\nuser interface: Um basic colours,\nmarketing: Or you haven't thought about \nuser interface: um yeah. Well you didn't say.\nmarketing: Ho how do we make uh \nuser interface: Maybe um company colours?\nproject manager: It's black.\nuser interface: Black.\nmarketing: Black and yellow.\nproject manager: Yeah, yellow light.\nuser interface: A bit a bit of yellow.\nmarketing: Can \nproject manager: Do we have yellow light? No, not really, but it's possible.\nuser interface: Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow.\nproject manager: It's \nmarketing: Black white, maybe?\nuser interface: Like white, also ni or uh always nice.\nindustrial designer: And what colours should the buttons be?\nmarketing: Uh Because um \nproject manager: Yeah, different colours. This is \nuser interface: Just um \nproject manager: Oh, the same as th th the cover. But also th the light behind it.\nuser interface: Yes.\nindustrial designer: But can you change those too, with uh the switch?\nproject manager: No, no. Make them No, just make them black or grey or something.\nuser interface: Yeah, grey. Just dark grey I think.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful? Beautiful is uh really subjective, uh because it has to do lots with the colours.\nuser interface: Well we have changeable fronts, so \nmarketing: Changeable fronts, so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful.\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: Yeah, just give it a one. It's okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's perfect. I think it's just what you want. Or not? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's hard to decide for us, but yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. It's ju so subjective.\nuser interface: It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls.\nproject manager: Okay, just give it a two. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. A two. Okay. The fancy look-and-feel. That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. And we can change the colours, so that's uh really fancy I think.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: One more thing.\nmarketing: So \nindustrial designer: Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too? Or n no back light?\nmarketing: Slide panel?\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nproject manager: No. No, it's only on the number, behind the numbers\nuser interface: Mm. Not needed .\nproject manager: and uh \nuser interface: Yeah, not needed I think.\nindustrial designer: And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too?\nproject manager: That as well, yeah.\nmarketing: Oh, you mean th this here?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but that's unnecessary.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: What do I think is necessary necessary item?\nmarketing: It's pretty cool. If you slide it open, it lights up. That's that's really fancy, but I don't know if it's reachable.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Of course it's reachable.\nproject manager: It doesn't make \nmarketing: Then we do it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, maybe just some light uh to to light it all up.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can see what's really there. Not just not re on the buttons or something.\nproject manager: No. Yeah.\nuser interface: Just a green light or some blue light. To light it all up.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: But Yeah. Mayb Okay.\nmarketing: but \nindustrial designer: Yeah, just backlight. Not not the buttons.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons, but behind the buttons. So the buttons are just grey.\nuser interface: Well yeah. Uh semi-transparent.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, just only Yeah, that's right.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, fine. So I I think it's very fancy.\nproject manager: So Yeah, that's how I think.\nuser interface: Yeah, w we've done a a lot of detail in light, so \nmarketing: So I'll give it a \nproject manager: Ye\nmarketing: Yeah, and you can uh also choose your light, so \nproject manager: Yeah, this It is a one.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's okay. It's cool.\nmarketing: I think it's one. Okay, next.\nproject manager: This is a difficult one, because we we don't Yeah, we don't know it about the \nmarketing: Learnable? Easy to use? Yeah, we shall test it But uh \nproject manager: Uh it's it's very easy to use, but uh the second layer is not easy to use.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's That's \nindustrial designer: No, but you don't have to use that.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer.\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it.\nuser interface: So I think it's easy to use, but And learnable is a bit \nmarketing: Learnable? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control.\nindustrial designer: Well, I think it is.\nmarketing: Because because I think I think the scroll wheel, uh it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel.\nuser interface: Well y just uh f\nmarketing: I think uh you must uh seek for it, and up or down or\nproject manager: But the rest of it is very easy,\nmarketing: Uh then the re\nproject manager: because there are so so n\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's very clear what it all does.\nindustrial designer: So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: But the second parts, uh like speech, etcetera, that will be harder to learn.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: It's Yeah it's \nmarketing: But \nproject manager: And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well, if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device.\nmarketing: Yeah. But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things, huh?\nuser interface: Device.\nmarketing: And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls. So we h we have speech, uh the scroll wheel, and um the the the slide. You must slide it. And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls.\nproject manager: But yeah.\nmarketing: 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Because easy to use comes after learnable.\nproject manager: Okay, just Easy to use is very cool,\nmarketing: I I think it a three or something.\nproject manager: so just give it a two.\nuser interface: Maybe three then. Learnable's \nproject manager: No, but definitely better, much better than uh than uh than avera average, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm uh. The normal.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know \nuser interface: Yep, true. Then a two.\nmarketing: Oh. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: New features. Techno technological innovative?\nindustrial designer: The speech function and the colour. Colour.\nmarketing: The speech function is new.\nuser interface: And the scrollwheel, backlights, slide.\nmarketing: The scrollwheel and the slide. Uh I think the slide is pretty new.\nproject manager: Slide is not n is is not new. No. I already have a \nmarketing: Uh I only saw it in a telephone, not in an remote control.\nproject manager: Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight. And they all have a slide in it.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So that's not new.\nuser interface: But also slide that buttons come out, as well?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, and the the the lightning?\nproject manager: That's cool.\nmarketing: Is that new?\nproject manager: Yeah for a Uh for a f\nmarketing: The lighting's new.\nuser interface: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Mm it's pretty new, I think.\nmarketing: Scrollwheel. Speech?\nindustrial designer: Speech is new.\nuser interface: Different colours, so \nmarketing: Yeah, different fronts for a remote control, I think that's new too.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we have a pretty new uh \nproject manager: There are no games on it, that's that's It's not a one, it's a two again.\nuser interface: That would And we didn't uh \nmarketing: It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something.\nuser interface: But then we also have the the home station.\nproject manager: If you have \nuser interface: We are forgetting about that now, but \nproject manager: Yeah. Oh yeah, that's right. Rechargeable.\nmarketing: Uh-oh.\nuser interface: We don't\nmarketing: Home-station.\nuser interface: recharge.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we didn't draw that too, but \nuser interface: But that's more like uh now.\nproject manager: Yeah, just draw it afterwards. \nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's just a normal th s simple thing.\nuser interface: I don't know.\nproject manager: If you Can you save it on the same, in the same map as the other ones? In the the project uh map?\nuser interface: Uh Just save, save as?\nproject manager: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh save as? No, that's not in the project.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well it's a already in the folder. L like number seven.\nproject manager: Oh yeah, okay. Smart board.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but this one.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: This one is not yet in the Oh oh.\nindustrial designer: I think it is.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it is.\nindustrial designer: No, I think it is.\nuser interface: Uh untitled?\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Yeah, it doesn't matter. Save.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: But you still have to draw the resi the recharger.\nmarketing: Uh all the the seven, uh all the seven.\nproject manager: Okay. And new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? No, I think i if you have games on it, then then you give you have a one. But not \nmarketing: No, we are not extraordinary new or something.\nproject manager: No, just so it's still a two.\nuser interface: N\nindustrial designer: Mm two, I think.\nmarketing: Tha tha that \nproject manager: Targeted audience. Uh we are the targeted audience? Do we like it?\nmarketing: No, we we we searched for uh um a young group, audience, beneath f forty.\nproject manager: Yeah, but l younger than forty. So we we are exactly the targeted group.\nmarketing: Yes. Yeah, but did we reach, um with our uh style, the targeted audience?\nproject manager: I think so, yeah.\nmarketing: Th that's my question.\nproject manager: You get the fancy things for younger people. And you get the the aesthetic things for older people.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: So you want \nindustrial designer: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel, and that's what attracts the young audience. So\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: think that's a two or a one.\nmarketing: Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh  That's that's That's this question.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but s it That's basically not not handy. And I don't thi I don't see \nmarketing: Yeah, this.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we targeted it? But we didn't follow the latest trends.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. No. Yeah, you could make a a front\nuser interface: Mm. I think we followed the latest trends.\nindustrial designer: a front that's that's like uh like a banana, or something.\nmarketing: Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer.\nuser interface: Oh right. Well uh fruit and vegetables, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, you get different colours.\nuser interface: You can different front uh \nmarketing: Uh yeah, th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh \nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Like a a f banana kind of front.\nmarketing: Oh yeah. But spongy will never be. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: So we give ourself a three or something.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: \nproject manager: Oh.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So that's eleven.\nmarketing: That's uh \nproject manager: It's \nmarketing: What's the average?\nindustrial designer: Eleven divided by six.\nproject manager: Yeah, it is one point eight three.\nmarketing: A perfect score. No, I don't know.\nindustrial designer: We're not too hard on ourselves. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: This is a a power indicator. So you can see how far it's charged up.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: And and you need n uh a button to call it, to let it beep.\nuser interface: To call.\nproject manager: Oh yeah, that's still {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: Call \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but uh we have to make a speaker then too. If you want to make it beep.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe we have to skip that one.\nuser interface: Okay. No no, I want that in.\nmarketing: That's Yeah, but it {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo.\nmarketing: No, we need that. That's usable. That's really usable.\nindustrial designer: If you do uh \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, th the speaker is very small as well, right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: It's uh \nproject manager: So I just got a financial um \nuser interface: Yes uh.\nproject manager: You s saved it or \nmarketing: Yeah. I did save it.\nproject manager: No. Okay, let's have a look at this one here, the production cost of it. If I forgot anything, just say it to me. It just is a battery. Yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. But okay. So I think we are pretty much in the right direction, because it's twelve point three Euros. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm okay.\nmarketing: That's fine.\nindustrial designer: But uh is uh uh \nproject manager: So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So that's both.\nmarketing: Come on, it's perfect. Uh twelve point three point three.\nproject manager: Yeah, and single curved curved.\nindustrial designer: But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or \nproject manager: No, that's not on the list. But that shouldn't be .\nindustrial designer: Can we make that for uh h twenty cents? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, we can uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Probably. I just The b the button supplements, I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure.\nuser interface: Um different fronts, but standard front won't be, yeah.\nproject manager: See it's I think it's okay like this.\nmarketing: Special form, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's hard to say. But maybe we have to um Yeah, okay. Special colour, you can skip this one, because it's all quite normal.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: We get different ones, that's all. So you can put a recharger in it as well.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But this is expensive, the sample speaker.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: This?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's four.\nmarketing: Four. It's four Euros.\nuser interface: Oh, them. Is that uh included? In the twelve Euro or\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's included.\nmarketing: So we are \nuser interface: Okay, then we then we need to use it.\nindustrial designer: It's kind of weird that we we get this information now, afterwards. Because \nproject manager: Yeah, no.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, so this is uh pretty much it this .\nuser interface: Damn, solar cells are uh expensive.\nproject manager: So I just want you Yeah, we just made it. So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay. We can do some discussion about this. Was there room for creativity?\nindustrial designer: Sure.\nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Paul, was there room for crea creativity?\nindustrial designer: Beautiful.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm uh i Yeah, I think so. I think uh everyone uh already. So \nindustrial designer: Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Or a different style.\nindustrial designer: then there we probably have been creative.\nuser interface: I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it. So \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. We could make a lot of different uh remote controls.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So it's creativity.\nindustrial designer: Huh.\nproject manager: Okay, so the leadership Was there a leadership and \nuser interface: Of course there was.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What do you have to say about that?\nindustrial designer: No, I think \nmarketing: Who was the leader? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Just normal discussion, I think. Not\nuser interface: Yeah. \nindustrial designer: one leader or something.\nuser interface: One leader to check the time, etcetera.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. And make notes. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, I know.\nuser interface: So more like a secretary.\nproject manager: Okay, next one.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh team work um The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard. We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with .\nmarketing: Yeah yeah. We were not finished.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, w we had so much information, that we get through email and just \nproject manager: We're not finished.\nmarketing: Uh.\nuser interface: Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. I think that was the m biggest problem.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Like uh the prices. If we knew that before, we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, th that's weird.\nmarketing: Yeah, because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now.\nuser interface: Yeah, and if you had uh fifteen Euros, then we would it.\nmarketing: And then {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We had to \nindustrial designer: Hmm hmm yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, finance.\nindustrial designer: So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: But the teamwork was okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, uh everybody could speak their uh opinion. And uh \nuser interface: I think uh everyone listen to each other.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design.\nproject manager: Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah, what I have to say about uh means. The smart board is okay. Digital pen is horrible. I dunno if you use it. But if you want to download it to your computer, it's doesn't work.\nuser interface: It was \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Just doesn't work.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with, if it worked really well.\nmarketing: Digital pen or \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Just not work too slow.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, i if if it would be faster, it would be great.\nmarketing: Yeah, the drawings are are hard to make, I think.\nuser interface: Yeah, more accurate. Yeah, it's i It should be more accurate.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Precise.\nuser interface: And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from, just with a mouse, from where you're sitting.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Not just pointing out on it.\nproject manager: It's the same for the presenta for the presentations. You can do it from here. That's much easier than standing there.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And so you've \nindustrial designer: Yeah, and p just point with a mouse.\nuser interface: No use to draw on the board itself. It's just slows down.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: But you might as well do it in normal computer style.\nproject manager: like .\nuser interface: Yeah, even harder to draw like this than black board style.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. And it's far too slow this way.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: You cou You could draw on it, but not as main function.\nindustrial designer: No.\nproject manager: I think Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Digital pen.\nproject manager: So we made it in time. And we made a remote control.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We did it.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: In the budget, yeah.\nuser interface: New ideas found.\nmarketing: New ideas.\nuser interface: Oh \nindustrial designer: What's that?\nmarketing: For for for \nproject manager: I don't know what it mean. Just \nuser interface: I just think if we uh \nmarketing: To gather, or to uh work together, uh or new ideas for \nproject manager: For remote control probably.\nuser interface: I dunno.\nproject manager: No, for the project. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: For remote control, a favourite for your text.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: No, for the prototype. New ideas.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but still, you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this. Because we don't have any sizes and \nproject manager: Yeah. But it's for the next team. We don't have to do that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time, I think.\nuser interface: That's for . Yeah, this this is just the idea phase, the \nindustrial designer: Yeah, just brainstorming basically.\nuser interface: Yeah. Details uh \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So are we finished?\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: Yes, I think just I just write a final report.\nuser interface: Quite early.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Yeah.\nproject manager: No, we have only four minutes left. Uh it's okay.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay.\nuser interface: Oh, what do we have to do now. Do we uh I thought we were done at four o'clock?\nindustrial designer: It's now quarter past three. So \nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: I should take some pictures uh.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm we can do it afterwards, so \nmarketing: Yes. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Let's play minesweeper.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I found it as well.\nmarketing: Ti-din ti-din.\nuser interface: One two three four five six seven cameras. Mm not bad.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So that was it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Now we can look at this.\nuser interface: This is \nindustrial designer: We're probably not supposed to look at this, but \nuser interface: The old versions.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, from the previous group. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: They went for uh for a universal device.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The touchscreen, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but also a different device .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Here are the basic functions in here, the selecting dev devices.\nuser interface: Yeah, and touch screens for all our stuff, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: I do agree with that. Yeah, tu-dum. English is not so hard by the way.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: I'm breaking a world record here.\nuser interface: Well, leader? Project Manager?\nmarketing: Oh shit. We've got a problem, Paul.\nuser interface: You do? Yeah, you have to make a choice.\nmarketing: Yes. No it's your choice.\nuser interface: Wow, that's pretty quick.\nmarketing: Tu-dum. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh uh um \nmarketing: Just pick one.\nuser interface: You have to decide. It's the lower one.\nmarketing: What's this? A bomb or not a bo\nuser interface: No no, the upper one is the bomb.\nmarketing: This the bomb?\nuser interface: Yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Wrong. Shit.\nuser interface: I knew it.\nmarketing: I knew it. Four in a row.\nuser interface: No. That's too much work.\nmarketing: Uh. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Come on.\nmarketing: Is that previous work?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, this one.\nuser interface: I challenge you.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh, that's so stupid. No, that doesn't work.\nuser interface: No, you gotta use the magic pen. Hmm. What if I put one there?\nmarketing: That's stupid.\nuser interface: We'll see.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: I don't agree.\nmarketing: Mm. Sorry.\nuser interface: Yeah, you had two choices. That's gonna be draw. Or not.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Too bad.\nuser interface: I'll put it here. You are going to put it there.\nmarketing: Yeah, then I put it there. No one wins.\nuser interface: It's a difficult choice, either here or there.\nindustrial designer: This is a very interesting design.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Ugly.\nmarketing: It's just the same as normal.\nuser interface: Oh a pen.\nindustrial designer: Well it has a L_C_D_, I think.\nuser interface: Yeah, but \nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Then do it correctly.\nmarketing: Stupid design. Stupid. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And what else do we have?\nuser interface: Stupid, the L_C_D_ screen.\nmarketing: 'Kay wait, I'm going to draw something and you must y {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: What? Okay, I'm going to guess what you're drawing.\nmarketing: Okay, blank.\nuser interface: No no, the new one.\nmarketing: Oh. \nuser interface: Uh they just don't save it.\nmarketing: Um I know uh.\nuser interface: A house? Yeah, you have to use the pen s stupid.\nproject manager: You have to save everything, you know that, huh?\nuser interface: No, not everything.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, everything.\nmarketing: Oh.\nuser interface: Pen, select select pen.\nmarketing: Pen.\nindustrial designer: It wants to know what we do in our spare time.\nuser interface: Okay. It's a house. A plant?\nmarketing: No, it's Only you can know it.\nuser interface: Oh yeah, I can know it. It's a \nmarketing: It's uh very hard to draw.\nuser interface: Okay, that makes it easier. I think I know. No, wrong.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: I think I know what you're trying to draw, but it's wrong already.\nmarketing: It's very \nuser interface: Yeah, you missed the right side.\nmarketing: Fuck. F\nuser interface: No, you're wrong, you're wrong\nmarketing: A little bit maybe, but \nuser interface: See where you're wrong now? The entrance.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Warning. Finish meeting now.\nuser interface: Alright.\nmarketing: Okay, the entrance is uh more to the left.\nindustrial designer: Warning. Warning.\nuser interface: You're correct.\nmarketing: Okay. But but but I think this part \nuser interface: Yeah, but I think \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh no you made another mistake.\nmarketing: Oh. Yeah, there are a lot of mistakes, because the walls are thick like this.\nuser interface: No I w Okay, I'm not that whiny. But uh there was a big hole here as well, and there as well.\nmarketing: Oh, that's true. Uh here. Yeah, they're walking behind the walls.\nuser interface: That's a kinda big mistake. Warning, finish meeting now. Guys, I think we have to finish the meeting.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Kay this is a hard one.\nuser interface: Uh?\nindustrial designer: Boom-boa-ring-bing.\nuser interface: What does it say?\nindustrial designer: Fill in the questionnaire. What now?\nuser interface: Come on. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, yeah.\nuser interface: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: No more chit-chat.\nuser interface: Oh you gotta finish\nmarketing: Che-che-che-che.\nuser interface: over there? In your own room?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: I'm gonna be so lonely.\nmarketing: Tu-dumm.

Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy, or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market. The Italians uh, how they think about it. And The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff. I made some criteria, and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. We sh we we we can give it uh a number, and then we can give ourself an average for our\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: um model.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: And this These are all I I I found, or I wrote down. And um we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven.\nproject manager: Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea. It quite beautiful.\nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: It's \nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: We are actu We are the \nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something. And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff.\nproject manager: Flashy.\nuser interface: Okay. Well I think we do \nmarketing: The LEDs.\nuser interface: If it's really uh, if you can if you can get the iPod look, then it's beautiful, I think.\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: But uh \nmarketing: And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of?\nindustrial designer: Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste.\nuser interface: Hmm?\nmarketing: The basic colours are black or green or yellow?\nuser interface: Um basic colours,\nmarketing: Or you haven't thought about \nuser interface: um yeah. Well you didn't say.\nmarketing: Ho how do we make uh \nuser interface: Maybe um company colours?\nproject manager: It's black.\nuser interface: Black.\nmarketing: Black and yellow.\nproject manager: Yeah, yellow light.\nuser interface: A bit a bit of yellow.\nmarketing: Can \nproject manager: Do we have yellow light? No, not really, but it's possible.\nuser interface: Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow.\nproject manager: It's \nmarketing: Black white, maybe?\nuser interface: Like white, also ni or uh always nice.\nindustrial designer: And what colours should the buttons be?\nmarketing: Uh Because um \nproject manager: Yeah, different colours. This is \nuser interface: Just um \nproject manager: Oh, the same as th th the cover. But also th the light behind it.\nuser interface: Yes.\nindustrial designer: But can you change those too, with uh the switch?\nproject manager: No, no. Make them No, just make them black or grey or something.\nuser interface: Yeah, grey. Just dark grey I think.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful? Beautiful is uh really subjective, uh because it has to do lots with the colours.\nuser interface: Well we have changeable fronts, so \nmarketing: Changeable fronts, so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful.\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: Yeah, just give it a one. It's okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's perfect. I think it's just what you want. Or not? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's hard to decide for us, but yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. It's ju so subjective.\nuser interface: It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls.\nproject manager: Okay, just give it a two. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. A two. Okay. The fancy look-and-feel. That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. And we can change the colours, so that's uh really fancy I think.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: One more thing.\nmarketing: So \nindustrial designer: Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too? Or n no back light?\nmarketing: Slide panel?\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nproject manager: No. No, it's only on the number, behind the numbers\nuser interface: Mm. Not needed .\nproject manager: and uh \nuser interface: Yeah, not needed I think.\nindustrial designer: And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too?\nproject manager: That as well, yeah.\nmarketing: Oh, you mean th this here?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but that's unnecessary.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: What do I think is necessary necessary item?\nmarketing: It's pretty cool. If you slide it open, it lights up. That's that's really fancy, but I don't know if it's reachable.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Of course it's reachable.\nproject manager: It doesn't make \nmarketing: Then we do it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, maybe just some light uh to to light it all up.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can see what's really there. Not just not re on the buttons or something.\nproject manager: No. Yeah.\nuser interface: Just a green light or some blue light. To light it all up.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: But Yeah. Mayb Okay.\nmarketing: but \nindustrial designer: Yeah, just backlight. Not not the buttons.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons, but behind the buttons. So the buttons are just grey.\nuser interface: Well yeah. Uh semi-transparent.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, just only Yeah, that's right.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, fine. So I I think it's very fancy.\nproject manager: So Yeah, that's how I think.\nuser interface: Yeah, w we've done a a lot of detail in light, so \nmarketing: So I'll give it a \nproject manager: Ye\nmarketing: Yeah, and you can uh also choose your light, so \nproject manager: Yeah, this It is a one.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's okay. It's cool.\nmarketing: I think it's one. Okay, next.\nproject manager: This is a difficult one, because we we don't Yeah, we don't know it about the \nmarketing: Learnable? Easy to use? Yeah, we shall test it But uh \nproject manager: Uh it's it's very easy to use, but uh the second layer is not easy to use.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's That's \nindustrial designer: No, but you don't have to use that.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer.\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it.\nuser interface: So I think it's easy to use, but And learnable is a bit \nmarketing: Learnable? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control.\nindustrial designer: Well, I think it is.\nmarketing: Because because I think I think the scroll wheel, uh it's very handy, but the first time you get this thing in your hands, it's not to use the scroll wheel.\nuser interface: Well y just uh f\nmarketing: I think uh you must uh seek for it, and up or down or\nproject manager: But the rest of it is very easy,\nmarketing: Uh then the re\nproject manager: because there are so so n\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's very clear what it all does.\nindustrial designer: So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: But the second parts, uh like speech, etcetera, that will be harder to learn.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: It's Yeah it's \nmarketing: But \nproject manager: And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well, if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device.\nmarketing: Yeah. But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things, huh?\nuser interface: Device.\nmarketing: And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls. So we h we have speech, uh the scroll wheel, and um the the the slide. You must slide it. And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls.\nproject manager: But yeah.\nmarketing: 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Because easy to use comes after learnable.\nproject manager: Okay, just Easy to use is very cool,\nmarketing: I I think it a three or something.\nproject manager: so just give it a two.\nuser interface: Maybe three then. Learnable's \nproject manager: No, but definitely better, much better than uh than uh than avera average, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm uh. The normal.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know \nuser interface: Yep, true. Then a two.\nmarketing: Oh. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: New features. Techno technological innovative?\nindustrial designer: The speech function and the colour. Colour.\nmarketing: The speech function is new.\nuser interface: And the scrollwheel, backlights, slide.\nmarketing: The scrollwheel and the slide. Uh I think the slide is pretty new.\nproject manager: Slide is not n is is not new. No. I already have a \nmarketing: Uh I only saw it in a telephone, not in an remote control.\nproject manager: Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight. And they all have a slide in it.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So that's not new.\nuser interface: But also slide that buttons come out, as well?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, and the the the lightning?\nproject manager: That's cool.\nmarketing: Is that new?\nproject manager: Yeah for a Uh for a f\nmarketing: The lighting's new.\nuser interface: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Mm it's pretty new, I think.\nmarketing: Scrollwheel. Speech?\nindustrial designer: Speech is new.\nuser interface: Different colours, so \nmarketing: Yeah, different fronts for a remote control, I think that's new too.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we have a pretty new uh \nproject manager: There are no games on it, that's that's It's not a one, it's a two again.\nuser interface: That would And we didn't uh \nmarketing: It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something.\nuser interface: But then we also have the the home station.\nproject manager: If you have \nuser interface: We are forgetting about that now, but \nproject manager: Yeah. Oh yeah, that's right. Rechargeable.\nmarketing: Uh-oh.\nuser interface: We don't\nmarketing: Home-station.\nuser interface: recharge.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we didn't draw that too, but \nuser interface: But that's more like uh now.\nproject manager: Yeah, just draw it afterwards. \nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's just a normal th s simple thing.\nuser interface: I don't know.\nproject manager: If you Can you save it on the same, in the same map as the other ones? In the the project uh map?\nuser interface: Uh Just save, save as?\nproject manager: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh save as? No, that's not in the project.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well it's a already in the folder. L like number seven.\nproject manager: Oh yeah, okay. Smart board.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but this one.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: This one is not yet in the Oh oh.\nindustrial designer: I think it is.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it is.\nindustrial designer: No, I think it is.\nuser interface: Uh untitled?\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Yeah, it doesn't matter. Save.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: But you still have to draw the resi the recharger.\nmarketing: Uh all the the seven, uh all the seven.\nproject manager: Okay. And new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? No, I think i if you have games on it, then then you give you have a one. But not \nmarketing: No, we are not extraordinary new or something.\nproject manager: No, just so it's still a two.\nuser interface: N\nindustrial designer: Mm two, I think.\nmarketing: Tha tha that \nproject manager: Targeted audience. Uh we are the targeted audience? Do we like it?\nmarketing: No, we we we searched for uh um a young group, audience, beneath f forty.\nproject manager: Yeah, but l younger than forty. So we we are exactly the targeted group.\nmarketing: Yes. Yeah, but did we reach, um with our uh style, the targeted audience?\nproject manager: I think so, yeah.\nmarketing: Th that's my question.\nproject manager: You get the fancy things for younger people. And you get the the aesthetic things for older people.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: So you want \nindustrial designer: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel, and that's what attracts the young audience. So\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: think that's a two or a one.\nmarketing: Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh  That's that's That's this question.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but s it That's basically not not handy. And I don't thi I don't see \nmarketing: Yeah, this.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we targeted it? But we didn't follow the latest trends.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. No. Yeah, you could make a a front\nuser interface: Mm. I think we followed the latest trends.\nindustrial designer: a front that's that's like uh like a banana, or something.\nmarketing: Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer.\nuser interface: Oh right. Well uh fruit and vegetables, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, you get different colours.\nuser interface: You can different front uh \nmarketing: Uh yeah, th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh \nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Like a a f banana kind of front.\nmarketing: Oh yeah. But spongy will never be. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: So we give ourself a three or something.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: \nproject manager: Oh.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So that's eleven.\nmarketing: That's uh \nproject manager: It's \nmarketing: What's the average?\nindustrial designer: Eleven divided by six.\nproject manager: Yeah, it is one point eight three.\nmarketing: A perfect score. No, I don't know.\nindustrial designer: We're not too hard on ourselves. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: This is a a power indicator. So you can see how far it's charged up.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: And and you need n uh a button to call it, to let it beep.\nuser interface: To call.\nproject manager: Oh yeah, that's still {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: Call \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but uh we have to make a speaker then too. If you want to make it beep.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe we have to skip that one.\nuser interface: Okay. No no, I want that in.\nmarketing: That's Yeah, but it {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo.\nmarketing: No, we need that. That's usable. That's really usable.\nindustrial designer: If you do uh \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, th the speaker is very small as well, right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: It's uh \nproject manager: So I just got a financial um \nuser interface: Yes uh.\nproject manager: You s saved it or \nmarketing: Yeah. I did save it.\nproject manager: No. Okay, let's have a look at this one here, the production cost of it. If I forgot anything, just say it to me. It just is a battery. Yeah, there are some that they didn't mention, because recharge is not on the list. But okay. So I think we are pretty much in the right direction, because it's twelve point three Euros. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm okay.\nmarketing: That's fine.\nindustrial designer: But uh is uh uh \nproject manager: So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So that's both.\nmarketing: Come on, it's perfect. Uh twelve point three point three.\nproject manager: Yeah, and single curved curved.\nindustrial designer: But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or \nproject manager: No, that's not on the list. But that shouldn't be .\nindustrial designer: Can we make that for uh h twenty cents? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, we can uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Probably. I just The b the button supplements, I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure.\nuser interface: Um different fronts, but standard front won't be, yeah.\nproject manager: See it's I think it's okay like this.\nmarketing: Special form, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's hard to say. But maybe we have to um Yeah, okay. Special colour, you can skip this one, because it's all quite normal.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: We get different ones, that's all. So you can put a recharger in it as well.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But this is expensive, the sample speaker.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: This?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's four.\nmarketing: Four. It's four Euros.\nuser interface: Oh, them. Is that uh included? In the twelve Euro or\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's included.\nmarketing: So we are \nuser interface: Okay, then we then we need to use it.\nindustrial designer: It's kind of weird that we we get this information now, afterwards. Because \nproject manager: Yeah, no.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, so this is uh pretty much it this .\nuser interface: Damn, solar cells are uh expensive.\nproject manager: So I just want you Yeah, we just made it. So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay. We can do some discussion about this. Was there room for creativity?\nindustrial designer: Sure.\nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Paul, was there room for crea creativity?\nindustrial designer: Beautiful.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm uh i Yeah, I think so. I think uh everyone uh already. So \nindustrial designer: Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Or a different style.\nindustrial designer: then there we probably have been creative.\nuser interface: I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it. So \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. We could make a lot of different uh remote controls.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So it's creativity.\nindustrial designer: Huh.\nproject manager: Okay, so the leadership Was there a leadership and \nuser interface: Of course there was.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What do you have to say about that?\nindustrial designer: No, I think \nmarketing: Who was the leader? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Just normal discussion, I think. Not\nuser interface: Yeah. \nindustrial designer: one leader or something.\nuser interface: One leader to check the time, etcetera.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.

If we knew that before, we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, th that's weird.\nmarketing: Yeah, because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now.\nuser interface: Yeah, and if you had uh fifteen Euros, then we would it.\nmarketing: And then {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We had to \nindustrial designer: Hmm hmm yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, finance.\nindustrial designer: So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: But the teamwork was okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, uh everybody could speak their uh opinion. And uh \nuser interface: I think uh everyone listen to each other.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design.\nproject manager: Yeah.

Yeah, it's i It should be more accurate.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Precise.\nuser interface: And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from, just with a mouse, from where you're sitting.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Not just pointing out on it.\nproject manager: It's the same for the presenta for the presentations. You can do it from here. That's much easier than standing there.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And so you've \nindustrial designer: Yeah, and p just point with a mouse.\nuser interface: No use to draw on the board itself. It's just slows down.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: But you might as well do it in normal computer style.\nproject manager: like .\nuser interface: Yeah, even harder to draw like this than black board style.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. And it's far too slow this way.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: You cou You could draw on it, but not as main function.\nindustrial designer: No.\nproject manager: I think Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Digital pen.\nproject manager: So we made it in time.

Any ideas?\nindustrial designer: It's about \nuser interface: One point four or something like that.\nindustrial designer: mm, mm yeah.\nmarketing: Seventeen.\nuser interface: One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, something like that,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so that \nproject manager: D fifteen?\nindustrial designer: yeah about seventeen, seventeen Pounds, something like that.\nproject manager: Seventeen.\nmarketing: Seventeen Pounds.\nproject manager: Okay, that's expensive.\nmarketing: Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later can't we?\nproject manager: I think so, I think so,\nindustrial designer: But \nproject manager: I'll be able to um pull it up,\nmarketing: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: or I could put it in the shared folder or something.\nindustrial designer: Havi having said that though, if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So, it'd still be \nproject manager: Really?\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: yeah, we had to buy one.\nmarketing: So\nproject manager: Mm. I think \nmarketing: so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price, we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option?\nproject manager: Yeah, um production cost's at twelve fifty, so\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: Okay, pretty huge margin.\nproject manager: half of the selling price is taken up by building it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Um, and profit aim is fifty million Euros,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: which is uh \nmarketing: In our first year?\nproject manager: Yi yes, um yeah, I presume so. Um \nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So then \nmarketing: You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: just t we're not focusing on business market, any particular thing, it's everyone\nproject manager: No, yeah.\nmarketing: user-friendly to everyone. Okay.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Big target group.\nproject manager: yes, yes, I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that, um making that a key point,\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia, America, things like that.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay. What are your experiences with remote controls? I mean I've got we got um we had three videos, a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: so we got one of the universal remote controls, um that you programme each of your things into,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: that c\nproject manager: but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again. I think it was quite a cheapie as well, so that might have had something to do with it,\nindustrial designer: Yeah uh.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but that was quite good, the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you.\nindustrial designer: Use all the ones at the same time.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Okay, you wanna integrate everything into one like \nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause you \nmarketing: My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy, not doing any tampering with it and programming, using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things. But basically on, off, volume up and down, channel one, two, th that basic functions,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: I don't think I could go any further with it than that, so, I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well.\nproject manager: Yeah, the main that's the main stuff anyway, I mean\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm. And symbols that you don't necessarily understand,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: symbols you're meant to understand that you don't.\nuser interface: So simplification of symbols you could think of.\nproject manager: Um. When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording, things like that inside it.\nmarketing: Oh yeah. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: it's obvious what you're doing, um.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Actually that just raises a point, I wonder what our design people think, but you know on a mobile phone, you can press a key and it gives you a menu, it's got a menu display,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Menu, alright.\nmarketing: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Uh uh \nmarketing: so you've got a little L_C_D_ display.\nuser interface: Right, I was thinking on the same lines you, instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user, may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that, like a mobile, yeah and with menus.\nmarketing: With menus, yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: What about the older generation? What about granny and grandads?\nuser interface: You mean to save it lesser number.\nproject manager: Um, my grandad can answer his mobile phone, but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too?\nuser interface: Right.\nproject manager: I don't think they tape things,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext, so {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I don't think they use \nmarketing: Right. Right. So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps,\nproject manager: Mm, yeah, the age gap.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing, 'cause I mean, menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: I don't know, I d\nindustrial designer: But I don't know how \nproject manager: I don't like the, you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: I find it really confusing, I kept getting lost in the phone, I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost, but that's just me.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I don't I don't know how for twenty fi, or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway, I'd assume.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books?\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Teletext has got that option as well.\nmarketing: Obviously it displays less on the screen, it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing.\nproject manager: Yeah. Or what about kind of a dual function? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play, volume, programme things\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.\nmarketing: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. The other thing is, just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again, it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top, your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm, okay. S\nproject manager: I think that's a cost thing, I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about \nindustrial designer: Y\nuser interface: It might\nmarketing: Yeah?\nuser interface: it might save a b bit of space, it's i instead of looking bulky, it might look small.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yes, no that's important.\nuser interface: But it might have its cost implications.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, like smaller.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone, it can still be lightweight plastic, you know?\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Right.\nmarketing: Something that's easily moulded and produced.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um, right, okay\nindustrial designer: No uh uh \nproject manager: we've got half an hour before the next meeting, so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things. Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Just just a quick thing about the um {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Sure.\nindustrial designer: about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics, so I think think the whole design thing might be qui\nmarketing: Ah right.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I mean you don't you you can still have plastic\nmarketing: Sure b y yeah.\nindustrial designer: and it'd look quite good but \nmarketing: But yeah, I mean it doesn't have to be that, you know th that was my main point,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: we don't have to use metal, I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: I presume it would.\nproject manager: I would \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: it would probably. I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything. They're kind of moulded and look a bit different, and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic, which looks a bit smarter,\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay, so let's break it up there.

{"fname": "product_test_75", "dialogue": "project manager: So let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision. So I will first uh \nmarketing: No y you do the minutes first, or?\nproject manager: What?\nmarketing: No?\nproject manager: I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first, Mister David Jordan.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: So, we'll S\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: technical accessoire?\nuser interface: No no no.\nproject manager: Interface?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: This.\nuser interface: Mm. So uh first I will present the concept of user interface. Um there's three concepts in the user interface. So first one it's a Google controller. The second is a fancy controller. The last one is uh intelligent controller. So there are three concepts in our controller. Um n next I will explain one by one, the first is Google controller. Um, so I want the controller to be easy to use, but with sophisticated functions. So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions. Uh this is a first concept of our controller. The second concept is a fancy controller, um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive, um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products, so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute, very very g um\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: A nice one.\nuser interface: attractive. Such like this, there are several uh examples in the slides.\nproject manager: I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very, you know\nproject manager: It's very big,\nuser interface: if you're \nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it. Or to recognise it,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, why not. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: We'll have big discussion I suppose after that,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: so.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So the last uh concept is intelligent. We want uh we want our controller to be smart,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: so maybe we should uh use um uh technology, such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology, so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition. Um With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user.\nproject manager: Okay. Something else?\nuser interface: Okay. No. There this is the three concepts of our controller.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: I just have one question, because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition,\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: but as the um expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. Do you think they will be able to use gestures?\nuser interface: Yeah, so \nproject manager: Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that?\nuser interface: Y\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Maybe.\nproject manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while. You don't think so?\nuser interface: Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button.\nproject manager: Yeah, sure.\nuser interface: For example, if you cannot find your uh controller, you can just uh just just uh speak something such as, yeah, one two.\nproject manager: I\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, that's a good that's a good point, so.\nproject manager: That's true. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: One and \nproject manager: Yeah, but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So you can use your gesture. That's no problem. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition?\nproject manager: Broken arm?\nuser interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very \nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, but suppose you have a family watching T_V_, and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yep. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But this this but this would never happen anyway.\nproject manager: Why?\nuser interface: Yeah, they cannot speak at the same time.\nproject manager: If you have one brother and one sister\nmarketing: Yeah \nproject manager: and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme,\nmarketing: Yeah, but the \nproject manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time,\nindustrial designer: Yeah but Yeah\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very interesting. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah but this \nproject manager: so.\nindustrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because the \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nmarketing: I don't think it \nproject manager: but you have the remote control, so maybe you can keep it f with you.\nindustrial designer: That's right.\nproject manager: You're not you're not obliged to share it.\nmarketing: Oh, okay, okay, you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff.\nproject manager: Yeah, we can yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three,\nindustrial designer: It's it's {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: so it's c come to channel three,\nmarketing: No, but this is disadvant disadvantage.\nuser interface: I don't have to \nproject manager: Yeah, I think it's a disadvantage.\nuser interface: It's advantage.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to\nproject manager: Yeah, but one other question.\nindustrial designer: manual controllers, eh.\nproject manager: How how much will it cost?\nindustrial designer: No, more expensive maybe.\nuser interface: How much?\nproject manager: Yeah. Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working.\nuser interface: No no we we d we we just are use um \nproject manager: Some some efficient.\nmarketing: Uh if you if if you use the basic \nuser interface: No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute, we don't have to do some basic research on this field.\nproject manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us? Or?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition, it's very \nproject manager: Yeah, but uh uh \nuser interface: it's uh yeah. It's \nmarketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built. Because then you need uh I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition, for example.\nindustrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem,\nuser interface: No it's uh Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the \nindustrial designer: you know when you \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: 'Cause it it have to be universal,\nproject manager: Yeah. I agree with uh \nindustrial designer: so.\nuser interface: The vocabulary is very small, so that's not a problem.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: remote control. We need something that is international. Suppose we're we want to sell it in France.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: The recognition system will be able to understand French. If you want to go to England, it will be able to understand English,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: so.\nuser interface: Yeah, the key, the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation\nmarketing: Yeah, this could be downloaded by the web maybe, or \nindustrial designer: Yeah but you know. The product The pro\nuser interface: mechanism. It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese. It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French.\nindustrial designer: It's a very smart, it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm, okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nproject manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control?\nuser interface: it's \nindustrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. But \nuser interface: Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed.\nproject manager: Yeah, but how will you \nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller, you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world, the same one.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: If you have the language, you have to develop for each country.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Oh n Yeah, yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but for each country you have to do one,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to \nindustrial designer: Oh really? That's {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: Seems to be quite complex.\nmarketing: but then w Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Comple\nuser interface: No, it's not so complex.\nmarketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros\nproject manager: And what about voice recognition, do we have microphones?\nmarketing: problem.\nproject manager: And where will be they? Do you think if we're far from television it will work?\nuser interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone. It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller.\nproject manager: Yeah, but where is the controller?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Where is the controller?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It's in your family, in your home. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but we're \nmarketing: No, but then it's it's like this uh \nproject manager: here it's uh an object. But here you say you want to use i uh s technology.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here.\nindustrial designer: A microphone maybe.\nproject manager: Yeah, but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this, if you have an object. If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free, without any object.\nindustrial designer: To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe.\nproject manager: You just want to interact with television.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here, then you\nindustrial designer: I if you say one, he switch to channel,\nuser interface: you use your command\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: and you do s your gesture.\nproject manager: but you can lose it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No no it's n y if you lose it \nindustrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box\nindustrial designer: Devic\nproject manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control.\nproject manager: Ah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But you would still have the buttons. Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons?\nuser interface: think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think \nmarketing: Okay, so you \nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: yeah.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: You can see they can switch form one modality to another.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, I dunno. It's a bit risky risky.\nproject manager: I think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: No,\nproject manager: And maybe it will be quite \nuser interface: that's quite inter quite attractive.\nindustrial designer: But I think that, you know, switching from one country to to another will be a problem, so although y y\nuser interface: Well, if you do language adaptation, there should be no problem. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah but i i {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I dunno.\nuser interface: We should have confidence in technology. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we should. Uh.\nproject manager: Hmm. So, what do you think? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: What?\nproject manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use, you as a remote control user?\nmarketing: If if I mean, uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price, he's happy to have recognition.\nuser interface: More features, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but \nmarketing: But if if if it like doubles uh\nindustrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable,\nmarketing: no one would would be interested.\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller. Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller? Hmm?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller, easy to use, sophisticated and fancy. You think it's possible?\nuser interface: Yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts. So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market? There's no k features of our controller, so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. No,\nuser interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that \nmarketing: I mean \nindustrial designer: It's not really the we\nmarketing: Y\nindustrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet, so or something like that. But uh I think a user need \nuser interface: Yeah, you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller, that's a function of T_V_. You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function,\nmarketing: No,\nuser interface: but \nmarketing: but you need you need new remote controller then. Because if you wanna browse internet or, I don't know, if you wanna type something,\nindustrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: or \nindustrial designer: if we can send email from it.\nuser interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller, it's it's also the issue of the T_V_.\nmarketing: No. No.\nindustrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if \nmarketing: Cause for example yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but uh we want so\nuser interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it, your mobile, but you when you choose a new mobile, you choose the one with voice recognition.\nmarketing: Yeah, you wou you would \nuser interface: That's \nmarketing: True.\nuser interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable, but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products.\nproject manager: Yeah, but w we we want something th that works all the time, every day, every hour, for everyone.\nindustrial designer: Yeah \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe,\nuser interface: Yeah, uh \nproject manager: You don't need to tune it.\nindustrial designer: so, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable, would you replace it with another one?\nproject manager: Yeah, why not? If it's \nmarketing: I mean, for example the goo y\nindustrial designer: Because you have new \nmarketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google. Google is is simple, works fine,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic, simple and works fine, it's already a lot.\nuser interface: Yeah. Oh yes, but there's no big difference between the traditional controller.\nmarketing: Uh thi this I mean, the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition\nuser interface: The then nn\nmarketing: or \nuser interface: no.\nmarketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy, looks nice and it's easy easy to use, easy to use.\nuser interface: Tha\nproject manager: Not too expensive too.\nuser interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller.\nmarketing: See \nuser interface: That's the same \nmarketing: That's the problem,\nuser interface: yeah.\nmarketing: yeah. I mean, I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever.\nindustrial designer: Ye {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But you have to think, the user is the one who gonna buy the product\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and so.\nproject manager: Okay. So\nmarketing: I mean, that's the point.\nproject manager: let's go to the Industrial Designer.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that, so.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Two?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, participant two um \nproject manager: Working?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, working design,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So I think \nproject manager: I can \nindustrial designer: Can you go to the next one? I uh it's not this one.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: It's uh oth the oth so I \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's the working design. Sorry. Component design.\nproject manager: It's okay {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: What? Are you inst\nproject manager: Uh I think there's something wrong with your \nuser interface: It did didn't r receive it.

Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh. Nope. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Dunno.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay. Yes.\nproject manager: It seems that we have a problem with the \nmarketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or \nindustrial designer: I can say it to you without.\nproject manager: Yeah, so \nuser interface: Yeah, maybe we can first come to\nproject manager: No, I think it will be more interesting to start with uh \nuser interface: uh to Frahan. With Frahan, then you can prepare your slides,\nmarketing: I think it's more interesting what he says,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nuser interface: then present it later.\nmarketing: okay.\nindustrial designer: exac\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You will had s some more information in \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, true.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: In fact, I don't know,\nproject manager: So. Okay.\nindustrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, never mind.\nindustrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: of the remote control. So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: and so. So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one. So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so it can be some, you know, classic pushbutton like this one, or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know, the button the buttons are unlighted during the night,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: or, you know, you can see them in the darkness.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation, electric alimentation do you want to have, so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: or will it be a battery like the classical battery so. And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them, so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from, you know, the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal, so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation, you just, when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it, for example.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think it's an added value to the remote control\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah mm.\nproject manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers\nindustrial designer: Ecologists, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery, would it be something really that will increase the price of production more,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: no?\nindustrial designer: Alrigh In fact, having them both will if we want to have battery, regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price,\nproject manager: So.\nindustrial designer: but it will be an added value also that will be compensated,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so hmm.\nproject manager: And what tha what about the uh materials?\nindustrial designer: And the materials, it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common\nproject manager: Impersonal, mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it's very resistant but, you know, something wooden will be like, I don't know high cl so a special high class,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Special for \nindustrial designer: or you know, you can have some \nproject manager: Yeah, and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, even if it is not completely wood, but just a part of the, you know, will be wooden, in wood\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm.\nindustrial designer: and it can be interesting.\nproject manager: Mm okay, seems to be interesting, mm.\nindustrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits, chips, or do you have low level or or very very expensive, it depends, but I think that low level will be, you know, it is an interim module.\nproject manager: Yeah, we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And you think that we will be \nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think it will fit on the price we want, twel twelve Euros,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: So wood.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: And what about the buttons?\nindustrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer, you know, the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because, you know, it's I don't know um yeah, in the dark, it's fashion\nproject manager: No it's fashion, yeah.\nindustrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost, you know in the darkness it's very easy so, right.\nmarketing: What about the touch scr touch screen? For example. It's it's expensive I I guess.\nindustrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: But And it is a kind of other design, I mean. It can also be interesting to have this kind of \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you got email?\nproject manager: I dunno. I think we have only uh five minutes left.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Participant four? Functional requirements?\nmarketing: Uh no, trend watching. The other one. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: This one?\nmarketing: Yeah. Uh, I think so, just Yeah, so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market, so next.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So again, it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting. Um user really really want a fancy look and feel. They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel, okay. Like the one you've shown, David, with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: but it's it's not what they want and uh So, second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative, so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: At the same time, it's important that it's easy to use. So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Now i if we look at fashion in general um Okay. Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables,\nindustrial designer: Ah yes.\nmarketing: okay, so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah.\nmarketing: 'Cause it's it's really what people want. Even if it's in general fashion, we want it to be in the remote control. And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points, fancy look and feel has, on a score of seven would have six as importance. Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative, it's three. Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one, and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris\nindustrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah.\nmarketing: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables. And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch,\nindustrial designer: Spongy 'Kay.\nmarketing: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design.\nindustrial designer: Okay, yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy?\nmarketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like um\nindustrial designer: Pla S\nmarketing: plastic-like, but rubber, mayb maybe, you know, rubber-like uh\nindustrial designer: Very stuff Okay, rubber rubber desi okay, yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: device, so um\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, tha tha that was the main point, I think, from the trend in fashion.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts, about the energy. So, as you say you want something technologically innovative, maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Solar.\nmarketing: Yeah, so when I think it's \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: maybe will attract\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm\nindustrial designer: It will be a \nproject manager: pro-ecology consumers.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Case.\nuser interface: Later? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So you think case. Something spongy. Someth no wood.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No wood but Plastic?\nmarketing: Maybe not no wood, but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know.\nindustrial designer: Would some \nuser interface: Pla\nproject manager: Maybe you \nindustrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and, you know. It depends on the design we want,\nmarketing: Yeah, maybe the base.\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: It's it's natural.\nmarketing: But still y\nproject manager: Th The feeling is natural,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's natural\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and i\nproject manager: so maybe we can stay with wood.\nindustrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy, solar energy, so for the marketing aspect, you know, saying that it's ecol\nmarketing: Yeah, I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view.\nindustrial designer: Mm, yeah, it's not right, so.\nproject manager: But it's still fashion.\nmarketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: or\nproject manager: Yeah,\nmarketing: I dunno.\nproject manager: something that you can into it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh and what about the user interface concept?\nindustrial designer: Google and \nproject manager: Google and fancy?\nindustrial designer: and fancy, f how about the the voice? And {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this.\nindustrial designer: Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested\nuser interface: Uh yes.\nindustrial designer: and how It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: The smart controller. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_, so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually,\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice.\nindustrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control, so.\nproject manager: That's true.\nmarketing: Yeah d\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller,\nmarketing: I dunno.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood.\nuser interface: Yeah. It's good.\nproject manager: And L_C_D_ buttons.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And pf what can we think a supplement to \nmarketing: What interface?\nproject manager: Yeah, for the interface something added value.\nindustrial designer: I think the supplement can be the voice. It is just, you know, it is not the most important, but it can be a part of \nproject manager: With a module? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: commands, words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: To push button, yeah, yeah. Even it is for s just some kids, you know, switching channels one two three four.\nproject manager: Turning the T_V_ o on o or off.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, turning yeah, yeah. Not very complex commands, but easy commands,\nproject manager: So,\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: adding some vocal commands.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Simple ones?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, simple ones for \nproject manager: Okay. So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction. So you will have to work on the look and feel design, to have the easy to use, powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yep. Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh you will have to work more, Baba, on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah, to make some new \nproject manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too.\nmarketing: Yeah, no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay, fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: If possible.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: And remember as as I said last meeting, we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control.\nindustrial designer: Need it to be, okay.\nproject manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: so you will have to model model something.\nuser interface: Okay. Yep\nproject manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: no more questions, we can close the session.\nindustrial designer: Sounds good, mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, cool.\nmarketing: Okay.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "This meeting was about conceptual design. The user interface designer first introduced three concepts in the user interface - Google controller, fancy controller, and intelligent controller. The first two were approved by the project manager, but the last one was seriously questioned. The group finally decided to mix the Google controller and fancy controller with some simple vocal commands. The discussion about product industrial design covered three aspects —material, alimentation, and chip. The industrial designer suggested using wood and having buttons with LCD, applying the classical battery and solar energy alimentation, and using low level chips, which was agreed by the group. The marketing expert gave three points from the market analysis. Users would like to have a fancy look and feel and the product should be technologically innovative. At the same time, being user-friendly was also important. Then the group discussed how to make these requirements into practice.", "zh_summary": "这次会议是关于概念设计的。用户界面部首先在用户界面中引入了三个概念—遥控器应该功能齐全，外观时尚，且设计智能。前两个得到了项目经理的批准，但最后一个受到了严重的质疑。团队最终决定采用功能齐全且外观时尚的设计，并加入一些简单的语音命令。团队从材料、电池补给、芯片三个方面对产品设计进行了探讨。产品设计部建议使用木质材料以及带液晶显示器（LCD）的按钮，应用传统的电池和太阳能来供电，并使用入门级芯片，这得到了团队的同意。市场专家从市场分析中给出了三点建议，用户希望遥控器精美时尚，技术创新，同时，方便用户使用也很重要。然后团队讨论了如何将这些要求付诸实践。", "fr_summary": "Cette réunion portait sur le design conceptuel.

Le groupe a finalement décidé de mélanger le contrôleur Google et le contrôleur de fantaisie avec quelques commandes vocales simples. La discussion sur le design industriel des produits a porté sur trois aspects : le matériau, l'alimentation et la puce. Le designer industriel a suggéré d'utiliser du bois et d'avoir des boutons avec LCD, d'appliquer l'alimentation classique par batterie et énergie solaire, et d'utiliser des puces de bas niveau, ce qui a été accepté par le groupe. L'expert en marketing a donné trois points de l'analyse du marché. Les utilisateurs aimeraient avoir un look et une sensation de fantaisie et le produit doit être technologiquement innovant.

Розробник інтерфейсу користувача вперше представив три концепції в інтерфейсі користувача: контролер Google, модний контролер і інтелектуальний контролер. Перші два були схвалені менеджером проекту, але останній залишився під великим питанням. Нарешті група вирішила поєднати контролер Google і модний контролер із простими голосовими командами. Обговорення промислового дизайну продукту охоплювало три аспекти — матеріал, живлення та чіп. Промисловий дизайнер запропонував використовувати деревину і мати кнопки з РК-екраном, застосувати класичне живлення від батареї та сонячної енергії, а також використовувати чіпи низького рівня, з чим група погодилася. Маркетолог представив три пункти з аналізу ринку. Користувачі бажають привабливий вигляд і відчуття, а продукт повинен бути технологічно інноваційним. У той же час зручність використання також важлива. Потім група обговорила, як реалізувати ці вимоги на практиці."}
{"fname": "product_test_76", "dialogue": "user interface: Mm. So uh first I will present the concept of user interface. Um there's three concepts in the user interface. So first one it's a Google controller. The second is a fancy controller. The last one is uh intelligent controller. So there are three concepts in our controller. Um n next I will explain one by one, the first is Google controller. Um, so I want the controller to be easy to use, but with sophisticated functions. So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions. Uh this is a first concept of our controller. The second concept is a fancy controller, um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive, um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products, so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute, very very g um\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: A nice one.\nuser interface: attractive. Such like this, there are several uh examples in the slides.\nproject manager: I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very, you know\nproject manager: It's very big,\nuser interface: if you're \nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it. Or to recognise it,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, why not. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: We'll have big discussion I suppose after that,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: so.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So the last uh concept is intelligent. We want uh we want our controller to be smart,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: so maybe we should uh use um uh technology, such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology, so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition. Um With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user.\nproject manager: Okay. Something else?\nuser interface: Okay. No. There this is the three concepts of our controller.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: I just have one question, because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition,\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: but as the um expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. Do you think they will be able to use gestures?\nuser interface: Yeah, so \nproject manager: Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that?\nuser interface: Y\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Maybe.\nproject manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while. You don't think so?\nuser interface: Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button.\nproject manager: Yeah, sure.\nuser interface: For example, if you cannot find your uh controller, you can just uh just just uh speak something such as, yeah, one two.\nproject manager: I\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, that's a good that's a good point, so.\nproject manager: That's true. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: One and \nproject manager: Yeah, but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So you can use your gesture. That's no problem. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition?\nproject manager: Broken arm?\nuser interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very \nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, but suppose you have a family watching T_V_, and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yep. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But this this but this would never happen anyway.\nproject manager: Why?\nuser interface: Yeah, they cannot speak at the same time.\nproject manager: If you have one brother and one sister\nmarketing: Yeah \nproject manager: and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme,\nmarketing: Yeah, but the \nproject manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time,\nindustrial designer: Yeah but Yeah\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very interesting. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah but this \nproject manager: so.\nindustrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because the \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nmarketing: I don't think it \nproject manager: but you have the remote control, so maybe you can keep it f with you.\nindustrial designer: That's right.\nproject manager: You're not you're not obliged to share it.\nmarketing: Oh, okay, okay, you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff.\nproject manager: Yeah, we can yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three,\nindustrial designer: It's it's {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: so it's c come to channel three,\nmarketing: No, but this is disadvant disadvantage.\nuser interface: I don't have to \nproject manager: Yeah, I think it's a disadvantage.\nuser interface: It's advantage.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to\nproject manager: Yeah, but one other question.\nindustrial designer: manual controllers, eh.\nproject manager: How how much will it cost?\nindustrial designer: No, more expensive maybe.\nuser interface: How much?\nproject manager: Yeah. Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working.\nuser interface: No no we we d we we just are use um \nproject manager: Some some efficient.\nmarketing: Uh if you if if you use the basic \nuser interface: No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute, we don't have to do some basic research on this field.\nproject manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us? Or?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition, it's very \nproject manager: Yeah, but uh uh \nuser interface: it's uh yeah. It's \nmarketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built. Because then you need uh I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition, for example.\nindustrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem,\nuser interface: No it's uh Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the \nindustrial designer: you know when you \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: 'Cause it it have to be universal,\nproject manager: Yeah. I agree with uh \nindustrial designer: so.\nuser interface: The vocabulary is very small, so that's not a problem.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: remote control. We need something that is international. Suppose we're we want to sell it in France.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: The recognition system will be able to understand French. If you want to go to England, it will be able to understand English,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: so.\nuser interface: Yeah, the key, the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation\nmarketing: Yeah, this could be downloaded by the web maybe, or \nindustrial designer: Yeah but you know. The product The pro\nuser interface: mechanism. It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese. It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French.\nindustrial designer: It's a very smart, it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm, okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nproject manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control?\nuser interface: it's \nindustrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. But \nuser interface: Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed.\nproject manager: Yeah, but how will you \nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller, you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world, the same one.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: If you have the language, you have to develop for each country.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Oh n Yeah, yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but for each country you have to do one,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to \nindustrial designer: Oh really? That's {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: Seems to be quite complex.\nmarketing: but then w Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Comple\nuser interface: No, it's not so complex.\nmarketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros\nproject manager: And what about voice recognition, do we have microphones?\nmarketing: problem.\nproject manager: And where will be they? Do you think if we're far from television it will work?\nuser interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone. It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller.\nproject manager: Yeah, but where is the controller?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Where is the controller?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It's in your family, in your home. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but we're \nmarketing: No, but then it's it's like this uh \nproject manager: here it's uh an object. But here you say you want to use i uh s technology.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here.\nindustrial designer: A microphone maybe.\nproject manager: Yeah, but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this, if you have an object. If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free, without any object.\nindustrial designer: To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe.\nproject manager: You just want to interact with television.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here, then you\nindustrial designer: I if you say one, he switch to channel,\nuser interface: you use your command\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: and you do s your gesture.\nproject manager: but you can lose it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No no it's n y if you lose it \nindustrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box\nindustrial designer: Devic\nproject manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control.\nproject manager: Ah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But you would still have the buttons. Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons?\nuser interface: think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think \nmarketing: Okay, so you \nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: yeah.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: You can see they can switch form one modality to another.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, I dunno. It's a bit risky risky.\nproject manager: I think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: No,\nproject manager: And maybe it will be quite \nuser interface: that's quite inter quite attractive.\nindustrial designer: But I think that, you know, switching from one country to to another will be a problem, so although y y\nuser interface: Well, if you do language adaptation, there should be no problem. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah but i i {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I dunno.\nuser interface: We should have confidence in technology. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we should. Uh.\nproject manager: Hmm. So, what do you think? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: What?\nproject manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use, you as a remote control user?\nmarketing: If if I mean, uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price, he's happy to have recognition.\nuser interface: More features, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but \nmarketing: But if if if it like doubles uh\nindustrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable,\nmarketing: no one would would be interested.\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller. Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller? Hmm?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller, easy to use, sophisticated and fancy. You think it's possible?\nuser interface: Yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts. So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market? There's no k features of our controller, so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. No,\nuser interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that \nmarketing: I mean \nindustrial designer: It's not really the we\nmarketing: Y\nindustrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet, so or something like that. But uh I think a user need \nuser interface: Yeah, you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller, that's a function of T_V_. You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function,\nmarketing: No,\nuser interface: but \nmarketing: but you need you need new remote controller then. Because if you wanna browse internet or, I don't know, if you wanna type something,\nindustrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: or \nindustrial designer: if we can send email from it.\nuser interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller, it's it's also the issue of the T_V_.\nmarketing: No. No.\nindustrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if \nmarketing: Cause for example yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but uh we want so\nuser interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it, your mobile, but you when you choose a new mobile, you choose the one with voice recognition.\nmarketing: Yeah, you wou you would \nuser interface: That's \nmarketing: True.\nuser interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable, but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products.\nproject manager: Yeah, but w we we want something th that works all the time, every day, every hour, for everyone.\nindustrial designer: Yeah \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe,\nuser interface: Yeah, uh \nproject manager: You don't need to tune it.\nindustrial designer: so, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable, would you replace it with another one?\nproject manager: Yeah, why not? If it's \nmarketing: I mean, for example the goo y\nindustrial designer: Because you have new \nmarketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google. Google is is simple, works fine,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic, simple and works fine, it's already a lot.\nuser interface: Yeah. Oh yes, but there's no big difference between the traditional controller.\nmarketing: Uh thi this I mean, the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition\nuser interface: The then nn\nmarketing: or \nuser interface: no.\nmarketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy, looks nice and it's easy easy to use, easy to use.\nuser interface: Tha\nproject manager: Not too expensive too.\nuser interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller.\nmarketing: See \nuser interface: That's the same \nmarketing: That's the problem,\nuser interface: yeah.\nmarketing: yeah. I mean, I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever.\nindustrial designer: Ye {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But you have to think, the user is the one who gonna buy the product\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and so.\nproject manager: Okay. So\nmarketing: I mean, that's the point.\nproject manager: Uh and what about the user interface concept?\nindustrial designer: Google and \nproject manager: Google and fancy?\nindustrial designer: and fancy, f how about the the voice? And {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this.\nindustrial designer: Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested\nuser interface: Uh yes.\nindustrial designer: and how It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: The smart controller. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_, so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually,\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice.\nindustrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control, so.\nproject manager: That's true.\nmarketing: Yeah d\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller,\nmarketing: I dunno.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood.\nuser interface: Yeah. It's good.\nproject manager: And L_C_D_ buttons.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And pf what can we think a supplement to \nmarketing: What interface?\nproject manager: Yeah, for the interface something added value.\nindustrial designer: I think the supplement can be the voice. It is just, you know, it is not the most important, but it can be a part of \nproject manager: With a module? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: commands, words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: To push button, yeah, yeah. Even it is for s just some kids, you know, switching channels one two three four.\nproject manager: Turning the T_V_ o on o or off.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, turning yeah, yeah.

{"fname": "product_test_78", "dialogue": "project manager: I just have one question, because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition,\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: but as the um expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. Do you think they will be able to use gestures?\nuser interface: Yeah, so \nproject manager: Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that?\nuser interface: Y\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Maybe.\nproject manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while.

You have a mute remote controller.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: So you can use your gesture. That's no problem. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition?\nproject manager: Broken arm?\nuser interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very \nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, but suppose you have a family watching T_V_, and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yep. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But this this but this would never happen anyway.\nproject manager: Why?\nuser interface: Yeah, they cannot speak at the same time.\nproject manager: If you have one brother and one sister\nmarketing: Yeah \nproject manager: and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme,\nmarketing: Yeah, but the \nproject manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time,\nindustrial designer: Yeah but Yeah\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very interesting. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah but this \nproject manager: so.\nindustrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because the \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nmarketing: I don't think it \nproject manager: but you have the remote control, so maybe you can keep it f with you.\nindustrial designer: That's right.\nproject manager: You're not you're not obliged to share it.\nmarketing: Oh, okay, okay, you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff.\nproject manager: Yeah, we can yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three,\nindustrial designer: It's it's {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: so it's c come to channel three,\nmarketing: No, but this is disadvant disadvantage.\nuser interface: I don't have to \nproject manager: Yeah, I think it's a disadvantage.\nuser interface: It's advantage.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to\nproject manager: Yeah, but one other question.\nindustrial designer: manual controllers, eh.\nproject manager: How how much will it cost?\nindustrial designer: No, more expensive maybe.\nuser interface: How much?\nproject manager: Yeah. Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working.\nuser interface: No no we we d we we just are use um \nproject manager: Some some efficient.\nmarketing: Uh if you if if you use the basic \nuser interface: No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute, we don't have to do some basic research on this field.\nproject manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us? Or?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition, it's very \nproject manager: Yeah, but uh uh \nuser interface: it's uh yeah. It's \nmarketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built. Because then you need uh I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition, for example.\nindustrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem,\nuser interface: No it's uh Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the \nindustrial designer: you know when you \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: 'Cause it it have to be universal,\nproject manager: Yeah. I agree with uh \nindustrial designer: so.\nuser interface: The vocabulary is very small, so that's not a problem.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: remote control. We need something that is international. Suppose we're we want to sell it in France.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: The recognition system will be able to understand French. If you want to go to England, it will be able to understand English,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: so.\nuser interface: Yeah, the key, the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation\nmarketing: Yeah, this could be downloaded by the web maybe, or \nindustrial designer: Yeah but you know. The product The pro\nuser interface: mechanism. It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese. It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French.\nindustrial designer: It's a very smart, it's a very smart controller maybe {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm, okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nproject manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control?\nuser interface: it's \nindustrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. But \nuser interface: Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed.\nproject manager: Yeah, but how will you \nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller, you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world, the same one.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: If you have the language, you have to develop for each country.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Oh n Yeah, yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but for each country you have to do one,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because uh the for example for Se {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to \nindustrial designer: Oh really? That's {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: Seems to be quite complex.\nmarketing: but then w Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Comple\nuser interface: No, it's not so complex.\nmarketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros\nproject manager: And what about voice recognition, do we have microphones?\nmarketing: problem.\nproject manager: And where will be they? Do you think if we're far from television it will work?\nuser interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone. It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller.\nproject manager: Yeah, but where is the controller?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Where is the controller?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It's in your family, in your home. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but we're \nmarketing: No, but then it's it's like this uh \nproject manager: here it's uh an object. But here you say you want to use i uh s technology.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here.\nindustrial designer: A microphone maybe.\nproject manager: Yeah, but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this, if you have an object. If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free, without any object.\nindustrial designer: To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe.\nproject manager: You just want to interact with television.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here, then you\nindustrial designer: I if you say one, he switch to channel,\nuser interface: you use your command\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: and you do s your gesture.\nproject manager: but you can lose it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No no it's n y if you lose it \nindustrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box\nindustrial designer: Devic\nproject manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control.\nproject manager: Ah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But you would still have the buttons.

It's a bit risky risky.\nproject manager: I think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: No,\nproject manager: And maybe it will be quite \nuser interface: that's quite inter quite attractive.\nindustrial designer: But I think that, you know, switching from one country to to another will be a problem, so although y y\nuser interface: Well, if you do language adaptation, there should be no problem. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah but i i {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I dunno.\nuser interface: We should have confidence in technology. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we should.

So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so it can be some, you know, classic pushbutton like this one, or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know, the button the buttons are unlighted during the night,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: or, you know, you can see them in the darkness.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation, electric alimentation do you want to have, so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: or will it be a battery like the classical battery so. And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them, so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from, you know, the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal, so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation, you just, when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it, for example.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think it's an added value to the remote control\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah mm.\nproject manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers\nindustrial designer: Ecologists, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery, would it be something really that will increase the price of production more,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: no?\nindustrial designer: Alrigh In fact, having them both will if we want to have battery, regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price,\nproject manager: So.\nindustrial designer: but it will be an added value also that will be compensated,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so hmm.\nproject manager: And what tha what about the uh materials?\nindustrial designer: And the materials, it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common\nproject manager: Impersonal, mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it's very resistant but, you know, something wooden will be like, I don't know high cl so a special high class,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Special for \nindustrial designer: or you know, you can have some \nproject manager: Yeah, and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, even if it is not completely wood, but just a part of the, you know, will be wooden, in wood\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm.\nindustrial designer: and it can be interesting.\nproject manager: Mm okay, seems to be interesting, mm.\nindustrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits, chips, or do you have low level or or very very expensive, it depends, but I think that low level will be, you know, it is an interim module.\nproject manager: Yeah, we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And you think that we will be \nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think it will fit on the price we want, twel twelve Euros,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: So wood.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: And what about the buttons?\nindustrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer, you know, the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because, you know, it's I don't know um yeah, in the dark, it's fashion\nproject manager: No it's fashion, yeah.\nindustrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost, you know in the darkness it's very easy so, right.\nmarketing: What about the touch scr touch screen? For example. It's it's expensive I I guess.\nindustrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: But And it is a kind of other design, I mean. It can also be interesting to have this kind of \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you got email?\nproject manager: I dunno.

Um so this is our functional design meeting, we're going to consider um user needs, technical effects, and the working design of our remote control.

Um I I'll get the ones up for next time, um they're not finished yet. Right.

Okay. Um, how do I put this \nindustrial designer: Just uh \nmarketing: I'll just put the cable in.\nproject manager: Oh yeah, sorry.\nmarketing: Is that it? Can you see? Oh, here. Okay. So what happens it doesn't work?\nproject manager: It sh it takes a few seconds I think.\nindustrial designer: You may need to \nuser interface: Who's that? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: But sometimes you have to do it \nmarketing: Is it in the right thing?\nindustrial designer: it's like a three set setting cycle, so press it a couple times, hold down function and then press F_ eight.\nmarketing: Oh wait, um. Uh. You need to help me. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-huh, and then press function.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and F_ eight.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Could you just plug it back into hers because she had \nmarketing: Oh, wait.\nuser interface: oh.\nmarketing: That's is that it?\nindustrial designer: Adjusting.\nproject manager: Here we are. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The cable might be a little loose or something. Oh, you got it.\nmarketing: Right here we are.\nproject manager: Oh. Is it on?\nmarketing: We're here.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, um. In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out. Um, the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about. Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look, they don't like the way they feel, they don't think they match their operating behaviour, and an example is what we were talking about, the buttons, they only use ten per cent of the buttons, so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons. Easy to lose, and R_S_I_. I don't know what R_S_I_ means. Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did, I don't have a clue.\nproject manager: Hm.\nmarketing: Um, according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons, I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance. So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour. And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently, so this is the order. Channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. The other ones are the settings, and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings, and then, just one, and then from there go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television. Um, about the screen, and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. And if we look at the market, f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds, I don't really know how to describe this, um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product, while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent, so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing. Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is, but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um, most likely, but we should discuss this together. And that's all I have to say about the matter, um.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Shall I what do I do? Do I give this to someone else?\nproject manager: Yeah. Just move right on.\nuser interface: Right. So get this. Okay so now I need to press F_ eight, what is it?\nproject manager: Uh function F_ eight.\nmarketing: Function F_ eight.\nuser interface: 'Kay. What's function?\nproject manager: It's the little blue w it's the one th\nuser interface: Oh function, I see it.\nproject manager: yeah. Yeah should be \nuser interface: There we go. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It should be yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. Um. This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user. So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way. Um so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way, uh or um maybe that making 'em the same colour, keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum, and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about, I would, about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing, um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_. Does it have like capacity to change the channels? Um does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_? And then, is it findable, and uh how do we wanna do that? And um I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring, um I dunno if this will work but And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those. Just I mean I like the one on the right better, just because it does have fewer buttons, uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size, shapes, that sort of thing, to best fit the user. That concludes my presentation.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Okay. You need the little thingy. Ooh.\nindustrial designer: How do I um \nmarketing: S That's on view.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Okay so this is on the working design, which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote, um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting. Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions, the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_. And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote, um input which would probably be buttons, although um we just talked about voice recognition, processor to take the information, um something to transmit it to the T_V_, and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration. And also you need a sender for location signal, which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall. And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works. Power comes from the battery, goes to the chip, um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_. And then for the location function, you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal, um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead. That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it, and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up. Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh, battery for the energy source, that way you wouldn't have to plug it in, um a button pad for input, um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff, I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_, that's just sort of standard, um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver. Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself. So that concludes my presentation.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nuser interface: Do you know about like \nindustrial designer: Mm?\nuser interface: I dunno, you seem like you know about {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh I d I was an engineer before I came here.\nuser interface: Okay. Cool. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Well thank you everybody. Um we have we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in. Um, teletext is apparently outdated, so due to internet popularity, so that's off the list. Um,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: also our remote should be used only for television, um, no extra internet kinda fancy things, just the remote and the television. Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this, so um the phrase is, we put fashion in electronics, so let's be fashionable I guess. Um if we have something I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours, so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw, and yellow writing, something like that. Okay. Um. So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions. Um, yeah. Do Let's \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming, see what we can \nuser interface: Like in terms of\nmarketing: How it looks or \nuser interface: how it looks, or like what it does?\nproject manager: wha what um well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing. So.\nuser interface: Yeah. Okay. So Is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button?\nproject manager: I think that seems to yeah. Mm.\nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: It's easy to implement.\nuser interface: Okay. So the \nmarketing: the the buzzer you mean,\nuser interface: yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Locator.\nmarketing: yeah, for sure, yeah.\nuser interface: So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range,\nproject manager: Yeah, teenagers and young professionals.\nuser interface: what was it?\nmarketing: Well that's for speech recognition.\nproject manager: Oh, uh.\nindustrial designer: Well \nuser interface: Oh.\nmarketing: And screen. That's only for speech recognition and screen.\nindustrial designer: I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and also, if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking, and if somebody says like one, then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one,\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: or it seems like a silly,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I mean \nindustrial designer: I'm not sure how you would implement it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I just put the values in.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And if if you consider our budget, it probably \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But um the screen is the same as what, \nindustrial designer: It's a cool idea but {vocalsound}\nproject manager: if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, I'm happy with that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right so um yeah.\nuser interface: Hu yeah.\nmarketing: Completely.\nuser interface: Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself.\nindustrial designer: Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you click the button, it's gonna send out a signal, and I was thinking, I_R_ is line of sight, so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work, um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone.\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably.\nuser interface: Alright.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can \nindustrial designer: It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote.\nproject manager: right. Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_, this thing?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote, click the button.\nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: So it's now like a two-part thing.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so it would be a two part package.\nuser interface: Okay. Alright.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: So we get to design that too.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Make it fashionable. Um, okay.\nproject manager: So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think so.\nmarketing: Yeah. Just there.\nproject manager: Huh. Okay.\nmarketing: Mm. Are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now?\nproject manager: We probably leave that. I mean I guess one takes care of the other, like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's \nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah. Then it can live anywhere.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. For the so you have that button, that so there's is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio?\nindustrial designer: Um on the T_V_ or on the phone?\nmarketing: Are we just having a radio? On the phone.\nindustrial designer: Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me,\nuser interface: T\nmarketing: You don't need a light. Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think that's what the phone has,\nmarketing: Yeah yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I mean when you need to find your phone, you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever.\nproject manager: And like if the if the phone's under the couch, you might not see the light, so\nmarketing: You can hear it's under the couch yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: So i Yeah.\nmarketing: Um, So need the other buttons. So we have this mm.\nproject manager: So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them, yeah you you did um,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That was that was me.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: they're I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing, and the other looked like just television.\nuser interface: I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes.\nproject manager: Oh really. 'Cause that that is something we have to decide, is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities.\nuser interface: And uh\nindustrial designer: Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: They're not no.\nmarketing: They're not, no.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s.\nuser interface: S\nproject manager: Yeah, that's right, yeah.\nmarketing: It not V_H_S_ here?\nproject manager: But D_V_D_ probably is.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, other than that region and coding thing.\nuser interface: Um \nproject manager: And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type, that's the the technology these days.\nmarketing: But V_C_R_s Yeah. Yeah, for sure.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah. So. Okay, let's see if I can I think still though, it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button, that works like with a you know, or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Well for sure we need the um I think we can just design the channels? I mean power's just a button, and it's not used that much,\nproject manager: S\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Huh.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: s and it's usually that red\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: You know, I've seen some remotes that where you just hold one, like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on. So you don't actually have a separate power button, it's just \nmarketing: Oh okay, yeah.\nuser interface: It seems like that would be hard though.\nproject manager: But \nuser interface: I mean, like because unless you know \nproject manager: It might be confusing. Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah. Just 'cause I wouldn't I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Besides you like to be able to go power.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I never think to hold something down. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I have the power {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. B Yeah.\nproject manager: I guess. So we definitely want a power button and numbers. Right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Well even um iPod thing, like um, I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number, of buttons, instead of having like one to nine, have a sort of\nuser interface: That sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah.\nmarketing: scrolling I don't know.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. Because people li seem now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no Know you don't have one two three four five \nuser interface: Yeah, yeah. I think that's an interesting idea, 'cause it's cool,\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: it's it's funny like you f like I just I don't have an iPod but like I, you know, I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day, and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily, like it's not that hard, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah, it's just and it's one thing which has everything.\nuser interface: Yeah, and it is yeah. It is really but do you need a screen then, do you have to have a screen then?\nmarketing: Well can't it tell the like can't you if you \nindustrial designer: Yeah, you can have the number going around in the corner.\nuser interface: Yeah. Okay.\nmarketing: you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button.\nproject manager: Oh that's gonna Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of \nuser interface: Like a disc. Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad.\nproject manager: okay. I've never used one. No.\nmarketing: It's like l this like that, and then you do that.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah and then.\nmarketing: And then you can have um if you actually just want to zap, you can have like a thing like that, and that, and then it can just be plus and minus.\nuser interface: Okay. So like it's like a little part of the circle that Or it oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can \nmarketing: Yeah, you can \nproject manager: Well i\nuser interface: zap.\nmarketing: Yeah, click o actually click on to have \nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: We could we could even have four buttons, like, if that's the if that's the mouse, you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. So volume could be like the top it and the bottom So do you need to \nindustrial designer: Doesn't it rotate though,\nuser interface: okay.\nindustrial designer: so it'll be moving around.\nuser interface: Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like \nmarketing: What do you mean the function?\nuser interface: I mean like okay, 'cause so I dunno, I guess Okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it, it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise. That that means you're gonna go up the channels, and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: But then \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way, that's that way and volume is up and down.\nmarketing: Yeah but it knows for some reason.\nuser interface: It just \nmarketing: The iPod knows.\nuser interface: It just kno the iPod knows. S\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: If it works on an iPod then it works.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Huh.\nuser interface: Yeah. So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want.\nindustrial designer: I don't have one.\nmarketing: Well for the volume you have to press the middle, and then go up.\nuser interface: Okay. That's what I mean. Okay. Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up, go up and down.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nproject manager: So it's like holding \nmarketing: And then well if you do that it goes, but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here, that I've seen.\nproject manager: You can o And you you is there an extra actual button? Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down.\nmarketing: Well what you \nproject manager: Like \nuser interface: It's like a b\nmarketing: for the iPod you press an w right if you're on the channel let's say, then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up, and if you do that it goes down.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here, I'm pretty sure \nproject manager: Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels, right, then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Like you could just have \nmarketing: I don't know,\nproject manager: Oh, like \nmarketing: you could click and then have it up and down,\nproject manager: Oh you could actually \nuser interface: Like \nmarketing: but I think \nuser interface: I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: But the only thing is like, iPods are so expensive, like, it has to be is that part of \nproject manager: Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of \nindustrial designer: I don't think so.\nuser interface: yeah, I dunno, I dunno.\nproject manager: they have so much memory though, that's it's \nuser interface: You don't think so? Okay.\nindustrial designer: I don't think it's the wheel dealy.\nmarketing: I think it \nproject manager: Yeah. I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah..\nuser interface: Yeah. I'm thinking we could if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know.\nindustrial designer: And they're re-programmable aren't they?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: You can put on your songs and then put on a different set,\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: that's probably why they're expensive, they're like little computers.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: S\nuser interface: Yeah. Well like since it just has the circle thing, you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape, like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah. Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass. Because, the other thing, I didn't tell you all my presentation, is that people find it find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and that's another thing they complained about.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um, what other buttons were there? Volume oh we've ts just said that.\nuser interface: So okay.\nmarketing: Channel selection.\nuser interface: This is just for T_V_, it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with \nproject manager: Um \nindustrial designer: I A D_V_D_ is simple, you just have play, pause, eject,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: You know actually our our new project requirements, I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things.\nuser interface: So how do you switch \nmarketing: Menu.\nindustrial designer: and menu maybe. Oh yeah.\nproject manager: So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next \nuser interface: Okay. So like if we had that \nproject manager: But we'll hold off on that 'cause \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: But s yeah uh.\nmarketing: But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote.\nuser interface: That's true, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So, I know I'm not c really clear on what \nindustrial designer: But it's cool to have it all on one, because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume, and then you wanna go to the menu, so you don't wanna switch.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm. Mm.\nuser interface: So you'd have to have like \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think you would have to have like a function switch button, you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T_V_, you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_, or you're like. So \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nmarketing: Yeah, it is only fun\nuser interface: but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc, the touch pad.\nproject manager: But i Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Oh. But I think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna \nuser interface: Yeah but it it would be \nindustrial designer: but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch.\nuser interface: So but I'm saying like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button, so like you're if you're on T_V_, like you can switch channels, but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know, to different I mean do we need to think about that,\nproject manager: Um, yeah, let's think about it\nuser interface: that like \nindustrial designer: Yes we can try that.\nproject manager: 'cause we need to wrap up.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "The meeting started by discussing the functional design of the remote control.

{"fname": "product_test_86", "dialogue": "project manager: 'Kay so we'll try to zip through this, since we're short on time. Welcome everybody. Um hope your sessions went well. Um so this is our functional design meeting, we're going to consider um user needs, technical effects, and the working design of our remote control. Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings, and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there. Um I I'll get the ones up for next time, um they're not finished yet. Right. Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this \nmarketing: And I can start if you want. Mm.\nproject manager: sure.\nmarketing: Is there an order? No.\nproject manager: Hm?\nmarketing: We haven't decided on an order.\nproject manager: No, any any order's fine. Yeah.\nmarketing: First. Okay. Um, how do I put this \nindustrial designer: Just uh \nmarketing: I'll just put the cable in.\nproject manager: Oh yeah, sorry.\nmarketing: Is that it? Can you see? Oh, here. Okay. So what happens it doesn't work?\nproject manager: It sh it takes a few seconds I think.\nindustrial designer: You may need to \nuser interface: Who's that? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: But sometimes you have to do it \nmarketing: Is it in the right thing?\nindustrial designer: it's like a three set setting cycle, so press it a couple times, hold down function and then press F_ eight.\nmarketing: Oh wait, um. Uh. You need to help me. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-huh, and then press function.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and F_ eight.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Could you just plug it back into hers because she had \nmarketing: Oh, wait.\nuser interface: oh.\nmarketing: That's is that it?\nindustrial designer: Adjusting.\nproject manager: Here we are. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The cable might be a little loose or something. Oh, you got it.\nmarketing: Right here we are.\nproject manager: Oh. Is it on?\nmarketing: We're here.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, um. In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out. Um, the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about. Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look, they don't like the way they feel, they don't think they match their operating behaviour, and an example is what we were talking about, the buttons, they only use ten per cent of the buttons, so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons. Easy to lose, and R_S_I_. I don't know what R_S_I_ means. Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did, I don't have a clue.\nproject manager: Hm.\nmarketing: Um, according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons, I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance. So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour. And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently, so this is the order. Channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. The other ones are the settings, and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings, and then, just one, and then from there go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television. Um, about the screen, and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. And if we look at the market, f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds, I don't really know how to describe this, um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product, while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent, so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing. Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is, but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um, most likely, but we should discuss this together. And that's all I have to say about the matter, um.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Shall I what do I do? Do I give this to someone else?\nproject manager: Yeah.

Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably.\nuser interface: Alright.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can \nindustrial designer: It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote.\nproject manager: right. Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_, this thing?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote, click the button.\nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: So it's now like a two-part thing.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so it would be a two part package.\nuser interface: Okay.

I searched the web, uh and uh I searched uh on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market. It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe, I forget it. Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. So it's very important for us to create something new. So what Michael just said, it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. Uh this uh aspect is the most important one. Uh it came out of the research. It uh is twice important as the following. The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative. Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features. And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion, because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: But um this is the second uh important uh aspect, and I think uh we must use some of the new technology, to be uh innovative.\nproject manager: But we already have the flashing flashing light on the \nmarketing: Uh maybe maybe something new.\nuser interface: Yeah, more.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: We have to discuss about it s uh Okay, uh \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Well, I'll I'll get back on it.\nmarketing: features not uh do not exist in current remote controls. And that's very hard I think. Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. But uh that was an overall uh point. We already discussed that. Um I've got one picture. Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So I took uh that part of the webpage. And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy, yeah, uh have detected the following trends. This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us, maybe. But it's about uh clothes and shoes.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nmarketing: But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy.\nuser interface: Spongy.\nmarketing: But spongy, what what does spongy says?\nindustrial designer: Spongy.\nuser interface: Spongy, like sponge.\nmarketing: Spongy. Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So rubber, kind of.\nuser interface: Uh soft materials.\nproject manager: But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. So it has to be flexible.\nuser interface: Yeah, but Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah, it's something that uh it stand there. But I didn't knew uh knew what it means. So spongy means y Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's like a sponge.\nuser interface: Soft, sponge.\nmarketing: So it's also a stress-ball.\nproject manager: That's a good That's a good idea. If it's de like that. That's good, a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, somewhat like \nuser interface: Yeah, but Yeah.\nproject manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control?\nuser interface: How are you gonna make it?\nproject manager: R_ soft.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: Uh \nindustrial designer: I've some uh material uh information, but I'll give you it later in my presentation.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What do I think? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control, I think about changeable fronts.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front. Because it's uh it's hot.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And uh some basic uh colour fronts. Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something. Uh maybe an extraordinary shape, like a sponge. Uh or uh, yeah, just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Just uh something round in it, or uh maybe not uh not uh Yeah, I dun dunno. We have to discuss about that. Uh y yeah. Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative. Yeah, how do we do that? Maybe speech? We ma must have some kind of gadget.\nuser interface: Yeah, I'll get back on that.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: It's very uh difficult to to to do it.\nmarketing: Intro\nproject manager: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Well,\nmarketing: Yeah, that's the problem. That's the main problem.\nuser interface: I got f also an email from the the technology department.\nmarketing: So Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations.\nuser interface: They have done uh research about it, and uh even more possibilities now with speech. So they recommended using it.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Well \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: I'll check what they exact mean.\nmarketing: Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then.\nuser interface: So uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah, well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. But maybe it's cheap\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: and it's easy to implement.\nuser interface: th that's the only problem. I d They don't say how much it will cost, so Um but uh\nmarketing: \nuser interface: if we implement uh speech recognition, I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well.\nmarketing: Oh. It's mass production. So you can say, you can \nuser interface: Since you have to uh configure speech thing.\nproject manager: But that's definitely more expensive than {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, that's that's something I dunno.\nmarketing: Yeah. But how uh we we're gonna make many of those. So we can start a mass production, and then the cost will still will be .\nproject manager: Yeah, but a telephone  Okay, yeah. But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros.\nuser interface: Yeah, so uh we gotta de\nproject manager: So uh \nuser interface: We have to decide on that.\nmarketing: Yeah. Okay. That was this?\nuser interface: Mm uh \nindustrial designer: Oh I got an email uh And it says uh the chip can be uh simple, regular or advanced. And Um They say uh a display requires an advanced chip. And this is more expensive than all the other chips. So\nuser interface: L_D_C_ doesn't require \nindustrial designer: it's m the most expensive. Yeah, it says in the email. The display requires an advanced chip.\nuser interface: Okay. And speech recognition?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, probably too.\nuser interface: Advanced . Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition, but \nuser interface: I'll I'll give you my design.\nindustrial designer: Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip, we need. If we're doing uh if we're doing a display.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. So we Well we can I had uh to make a sort of a design. So I did some searching on the internet. I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls. I think we should um This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players. Mobile phones.\nproject manager: Yeah, just modern modern but still uh basic.\nuser interface: More modern. Y yes. Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller. 'Cause remote con control, you can see it here, you have to bo reach both out both sides. And here you just have one, few buttons. So that's that's the main difference. But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this. And then changeable fonts, so \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: It's the most important part, I think. But And the home base is something like that, something simple. Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit. Uh basic buttons. On-off, mute. And th maybe two others, I dunno. Text buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe the teletext tel\nuser interface: Yeah, text button, maybe there and there. And then the colour buttons, if we want it on. I don't find it very usable,\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: but it's \nmarketing: No, I don't uh I don't like it.\nuser interface: Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well. So \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: and then yeah we saw the the pla display, in the the iPod. They can put the basic buttons, one, two, three, four. And uh f above ten. And I think \nindustrial designer: But it That's on on the display.\nuser interface: No no. That th there is no display there. But it's on the place of the display. And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So the focus is on these two parts.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So you don't see all the buttons you else need.\nproject manager: But it sounds very difficult to use. Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it.\nuser interface: Uh well um \nproject manager: So you can't use your thumb for it.\nuser interface: This is how it is now. Um Here uh Well we have volume.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: I think it is on uh on the bottom too.\nproject manager: down there. But it's not not the best best.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well here we have also side scrolls. I dunno if we can use that. Do we want to use \nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, for volume. For volume, or a channel.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I've I've got something of that uh too.\nproject manager: Yeah, why not.\nuser interface: For volume? Well then we can even simplify it more.\nindustrial designer: Scroll.\nuser interface: By just putting the volume on the side.\nproject manager: And the channels as well.\nuser interface: And and just channel buttons here.\nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: But I think uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah, or uh maybe uh The channel buttons are often used. And you can't use them now with your thumb, because the thing is not, it's not easy to control.\nuser interface: Well. Yeah, well it's Basically it's it's here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah okay, m maybe we cho should put that on top, and buttons we we don't use on, in the bottom.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's better.\nuser interface: They're on top?\nproject manager: Yeah, just th th th other buttons like text T_V_. Put that on the button bottom.\nindustrial designer: Because uh you can't hold it. You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons.\nuser interface: You mean uh these to the low?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Except from the on-off button.\nuser interface: Oh okay. Well, yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons, like one two three. So maybe we can put that on the bottom.\nuser interface: Mm Maybe. I dunno, but yeah we'll \nindustrial designer: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time.\nuser interface: Yeah, maybe it's not easy if it's below. It's harder to zap. So I think uh it should be should be easy to . I think it's pretty standard, these rubber buttons on the top.\nindustrial designer: Yeah okay.\nuser interface: And uh if you don't light 'em up, they don't uh you don't see 'em very good.\nindustrial designer: That's that's good, but \nuser interface: I think it's modern to light this area up, and to light this area up. So the focus gets on these parts and not on there.\nindustrial designer: Yeah okay.\nuser interface: But uh the position of course can be different. It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use, and how it's easier to use.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So we can uh switch these to \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: I dunno if it l will look good, if you put those on t on the bottom half.\nindustrial designer: No, I think th the the top buttons are okay. They sh Those should be on top.\nuser interface: Okay. Yeah, maybe {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But uh we we can switch those two,\nuser interface: Those two, yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: And uh, yeah, you have to make sure it's easy to uh Yes, it has to be big enough so you can hold it, right. \nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Well that's that's my findings. So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look. M_P_ three player. And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something, we I don't think we should put it on top then. I think that, if we're gonna put in more technology, that you need to be able to uh switch it open.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.\nuser interface: To use \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So if you put in uh speech recognition, you need so more uh many more buttons. Which won't look good on the front side I think.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: So that's something we have to decide on.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we have to keep it simple.\nproject manager: We have to decide this this lecture, or this this this uh fifty minutes, yeah, how it is gonna look.\nuser interface: Yeah. What we're gonna do. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay, the component design. I looked at uh some similar devices, and uh my own common knowledge. So uh this was on the web site. If you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green, blue, red. So flashy kinda colours. Uh shapes should be curved, so round shapes. Not Nothing square-like.\nproject manager: Okay, so Hmm, okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah well uh iPod is trendy. And it is well curved square.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Square. Like.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but mm is uh has round corners I think.\nuser interface: Okay. So not {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. Not uh the old uh box look.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. And um sports and gaming device style characteristics. I don't know exactly what that means, but it should be, well yeah, popular kind of\nproject manager: Yeah, we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control.\nindustrial designer: looking, I think.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So the colours also.\nuser interface: Mm Yeah, it's \nproject manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black, black, yellow.\nuser interface: Black yellow control. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, mm n Not that weird, because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy, to attract a young public.\nuser interface: Yeah, but uh I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together. But \nproject manager: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front.\nindustrial designer: No, okay. That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes, but \nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: We have to use uh kind of flashy colours, I think.\nuser interface: Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts, with all with the the logo on it? Can we do that? So \nproject manager: Yeah, it's cool. Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue\nproject manager: And still trans\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: Still still transparent.\nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: and \nmarketing: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. But with all with logo on it.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Well this is a remote control, a very old one. Um Then the components. The case has just a Here's black.\nproject manager: Yeah, we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material. Uh I'm not sure.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I dunno.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe. But anyways uh it should be transparent. We decided that, huh?\nuser interface: Well one of the options.\nindustrial designer: S\nuser interface: You can Just like a mobile phone, you can make um different fronts on it.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: So you can just replace them I think. That was the idea,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we could do that.\nuser interface: or just uh release one.\nproject manager: Yeah. Just give five with them, just in a box. Five different \nuser interface: Yeah, uh Or just uh sell different ones.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent.\nproject manager: Yeah. Cool.\nindustrial designer: So you can still th look through it.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um the buttons. Normal rubber I think. Like normal ordinary buttons. Soft.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I uh I dunno.\nproject manager: It it could be like a Nokia, like plastic.\nuser interface: A more Yeah, just uh \nmarketing: Uh uh \nproject manager: That's better prob\nindustrial designer: With the hard hard buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think uh rubber really has an odd look.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah. The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls, uh the buttons are part of the uh the style, I think is part of the remote control itself.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape. Uh it's n doesn't Is uh a button uh um How do you say it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's it's all on one level.\nmarketing: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, on one level.\nmarketing: It is in uh the c a remote control uh \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I know what you mean. So we have to keep it on the one level. Like th the top it's \nuser interface: Yeah,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: like mobile phones. Like uh the iPod.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Uh just \nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's cool.\nindustrial designer: Okay, it's chos So that should be hard plastic. Then the buttons?\nuser interface: I dunno what uh kind of material it is.\nindustrial designer: I think. Or maybe \nuser interface: But \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material. Just only the basic uh\nuser interface: Oops.\nproject manager: basic remote control from normal plastic,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: the rounds of it from softer s\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And um Then the L_E_D_. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I dunno.\nindustrial designer: The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient. And back light L_E_D_s.\nproject manager: Y\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Cool.\nindustrial designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent, otherwise the back light won't work.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So if you put \nproject manager: Y i if you The numbers could be can be \nuser interface: Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh \nproject manager: Yeah, that's right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Or it runs the whole \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we can still make it transparent. So \nproject manager: They can choose.\nuser interface: Yeah, you can halfs transparent,\nindustrial designer: Or no\nuser interface: or just that it's comes out a bit.\nindustrial designer: Yeah okay. Good. And in green colour, the back lights\nuser interface: Different, I think, also.\nindustrial designer: or \nproject manager: Blue. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nuser interface: Blue or red.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Whatever you want it, I think.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Uh depends on the colour of the \nproject manager: Yeah, but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it.\nmarketing: Uh i {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You have to choose \nuser interface: Yeah, that's true. But \nindustrial designer: No, but I think there are multiple colour LEDs. So \nproject manager: Is it Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: I I know I dunno. Is \nmarketing: but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control?\nuser interface: Yeah, it can.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well.\nmarketing: You \nindustrial designer: Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive.\nproject manager: Maybe put some different ones in it. Doesn't matter. It's just No, just some LED.\nuser interface: I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone.\nindustrial designer: I think it's \nuser interface: And I can change the colour of it.\nproject manager: Okay, cool. Just make it some different colours. Blue, red and green, or something.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I dunno. Maybe it's too expensive, but it I th I don't think so.\nuser interface: Well, we don't put put in any fancier technology yet. So \nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Then uh some more technical things.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't know what it is, but it should be there I think.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um this is the normal circuit board, like a chip board in in a lot of uh things.\nproject manager: Yeah, we have to hurry up a bit, so {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators. There's all these kind of things.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls.\nuser interface: I'm sure we can fit in.\nindustrial designer: So I guess we j we just need that.\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't know what they do or \nuser interface: Yeah okay.\nmarketing: Okay yeah,\nuser interface: We just \nmarketing: you can you can change Yeah. No.\nindustrial designer: Nah, but they just said we need it.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh the battery contacts, like normal batteries ca you can put in.\nproject manager: Yeah, a recharger maybe.\nuser interface: Yeah, we have to make sure to uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah okay.\nproject manager: We still want to have a recharger, don't we?\nindustrial designer: Yeah but \nproject manager: Is that still the \nuser interface: Yes. Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it? Accu.\nproject manager: A recha Oh no. Uh Battery. It's just a battery. Yeah.\nuser interface: Re recharger. Base station.\nindustrial designer: Y uh just just batteries, rechargeable batteries.\nuser interface: Yeah, batteries. Yes, rechargeable batteries, I think's best.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Not a separate \nproject manager: No, just rechargeable batteries.\nindustrial designer: Okay. And uh a chip, that's this one.\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: Then uh I received some possibilities. Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch. So it operates on your wrist kinda.\nmarketing: Ah cool. Okay.\nproject manager: But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch.\nuser interface: So if you hold it, it gets powered.\nindustrial designer: If you hold it. Yeah, I don't think it will work, and Or we can also use solar cells. But you mostly use it indoors,\nproject manager: It's dark in the room. No.\nuser interface: \nproject manager: It's just batteries,\nindustrial designer: so \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: that's cheaper .\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and and we can use the home station kind of thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um cases, flat, so uncurved. Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back. And three D_ curved is also in depth.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So that's possible. Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls, we must use rubber buttons.\nuser interface: Mm. So\nindustrial designer: So we can't use the flat buttons.\nuser interface: we need uh two D_.\nproject manager: Yeah. Definitely.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think. Um these kinda materials can be used.\nproject manager: But it doesn't really matter, we just make it plastic.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think so too.\nproject manager: The scroll wheels, that's cool. That's for the volume.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, scroll wheels um \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's good. We can use multiple scroll wheels, w if we want to.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I think just the volume is enough.\nuser interface: Uh For channels it's not handy,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: because you scroll too fast.\nindustrial designer: And uh the L_C_D_. So we need uh the expensive, most expensive chip, if we use an L_C_D_.\nmarketing: Mm \nproject manager: I don't think that's an opportunity. Just skip it. Because we don't have time for that to to put it in.\nindustrial designer: Okay, then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip. So th so the regular chip. Because we use scroll wheels.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And um Yeah, that was it I guess.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh are are we using a a rubber case, or \nproject manager: Oh just sk\nindustrial designer: We haven't decided yet.\nproject manager: Maybe you have to skip that one as well. It's \nuser interface: Uh I don't think a rubber case looks \nindustrial designer: L\nmarketing: Uh but we have to do something about the trend.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, i it it should be soft. You said so?\nmarketing: The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay. That Uh fruit and veg, or \nmarketing: And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two.\nuser interface: Yeah, fruit and veg can be just the covers.\nmarketing: Uh yeah i Just Just on front.\nuser interface: So you can the the spongy yeah, I dunno. I can't imagine a soft remote control.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Neith uh I don't like it uh neither.\nproject manager: No. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I just can't imagine it.\nindustrial designer: So just hard plastic?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Titanium. It's mentioned here uh.\nindustrial designer: Titanium, uh I think it's too expensive.\nproject manager: But maybe the form has to be a bit different. Not the sh the square form. Just a bit\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: more rounded.\nindustrial designer: you can make it curved or mm round. But just in two D_, not in depth.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, that's right.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. What exactly. Because we have to know it. So the energy uh is the recharger.\nuser interface: \nproject manager: We already know that. Just a normal battery.\nuser interface: Yeah. We have batteries.\nproject manager: Okay. The chip-on-print is a normal one.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Regular.\nproject manager: Okay, the case is just a plastic one.\nindustrial designer: Yeah th yeah, the chip is the the regular one.\nproject manager: Yeah, re Yeah, regular. Yeah, okay. Yeah, regular.\nindustrial designer: You have the simple one, regular and advanced. So it's b should be regular uh the second.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I think I'll just check it.\nproject manager: And we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel. \nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: That's pretty much it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And a flashy light.\nuser interface: User interface concept.\nproject manager: So uh I'm not sure. But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment. But \nuser interface: I dunno either.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Or should we do it in the next meeting?\nuser interface: Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board.\nproject manager: Yeah. That's for the next one.\nindustrial designer: So we should did it here?\nproject manager: That's for th\nuser interface: So we're staying here?\nproject manager: Uh that I think that's the next next meeting.\nindustrial designer: Or should we do it in the next meeting? Okay.\nproject manager: But you definitely get a specific instruction. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But th think about something that's more rounded. Just And more It has to be \nuser interface: Yeah, uh I dunno. But the iPod and etcetera, M_P_ three players, mobile phones.\nproject manager: Uh a bit. Just just on the top or on the bottom.\nuser interface: Just a bit cur Okay, I'll see if I can see any of those.\nproject manager: Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this. O um if you draw it like this, you get a What the fuck is it? Okay. Mm Doesn't work. You see what I mean?\nindustrial designer: What?\nproject manager: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh. Okay.\nproject manager: Nah okay. Just . Maybe you can make it like this. And this is all the wheel for volume. So that you just um It's all rounded, so you can do uh turn this one.\nindustrial designer: Like a very big scroll-wheel. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but just not on the top, but uh on the side of it.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Maybe, I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Okay, so we have this at the moment.\nindustrial designer: I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted.\nuser interface: Yeah, you \nproject manager: Okay, so\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: we'd have this. Is that okay?\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: that's a little problem, of course, as well.\nindustrial designer: I think it's probably better.\nproject manager: And \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but maybe we can make a a plastic, so that you i if you like drop it, it won't change the volume. Only if you use your finger.\nuser interface: Yeah, maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy.\nproject manager: Like this. And uh what's the channel choose? Where do we uh put that? Still on the bottom\nindustrial designer: I think in middle.\nproject manager: or \nuser interface: Uh wh what is the middle part?\nproject manager: That's the numbers.\nuser interface: Numbers, okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle.\nuser interface: Yeah, I agree as well.\nproject manager: It doesn't make a difference, if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other.\nuser interface: Use the dz\nproject manager: Because you already have the volume here, so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there. Next to each other. back and forth.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's right.\nproject manager: So you can also can put it all on the top, and this, you keep this empty. Because you have to hold it as well.\nindustrial designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below.\nproject manager: But that's not want to zap very quick, so \nuser interface: Yeah, I think uh zapping is the highest priority.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah? Is this a opportunity,\nuser interface: And then you use those uh \nproject manager: or you don't want a different \nuser interface: Yeah, of course uh.\nindustrial designer: Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other, so \nproject manager: Why?\nindustrial designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up \nproject manager: But still the next It's still the next one. Doesn't make \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up, and down button is If you put them \nproject manager: Yeah, but fo from left to right is exactly the same. It ma it doesn't make a big difference.\nuser interface: Yeah. I I think it's It's it's obvious, I think.\nindustrial designer: But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with uh channel changing.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's not not It's not al uh always the same.\nproject manager: But it's exactly th\nindustrial designer: In uh On most on most remote controls.\nmarketing: Every remote control's uh different.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think \nindustrial designer: So so if we use that, they will probably have a long learning uh time.\nproject manager: I dunno. I You already have the volume on the side,\nuser interface: No, uh I think \nproject manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So it's uh \nuser interface: I think it's s so simple\nindustrial designer: I dunno.\nuser interface: you just \nproject manager: So but that's for that's for you,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: 'cause it's \nuser interface: Yeah, okay I'll d I'll take a look at it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, so hmm. What did What else we have to discuss about? I dunno.\nuser interface: Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again?\nmarketing: Yeah, we have to care that it r uh looks really new. Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside.\nproject manager: And the LED.\nuser interface: No, you have uh It is \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but i i it should be round in in shape.\nuser interface: Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic.\nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: You have to look at that image of the iPod.\nmarketing: Yes. Okay.\nuser interface: More that uh kind of style.\nmarketing: And a bit uh \nuser interface: Not not the old grey black \nproject manager: Uh Yeah.\nmarketing: Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Where you can put a ve Uh we have If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo.\nproject manager: Yeah. Uh the logo was has to be on there. Yeah, that's right.\nmarketing: Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then? Uh five or something?\nproject manager: Yeah, five. Let's give five.\nuser interface: \nmarketing: Or more or \nuser interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh \nmarketing: And um uh uh buy the product. You buy, you get one. And uh basic.\nuser interface: Yeah. Um\nmarketing: Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project.\nuser interface: I think Yeah. That's your choice, I think huh.\nindustrial designer: No, tha that will be \nproject manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? Is that is that a good good opportunity?\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: So you could put it like that,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so top down.\nproject manager: okay.\nindustrial designer: Hmm?\nmarketing: Yeah, you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station.\nindustrial designer: Do we have to design that w as well?\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh I'm not sure.\nindustrial designer: The docking station?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think so.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: But th Yeah, that can be very simple. Least.\nmarketing: Yeah, we can b It c it could be just just a square, just a packet.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just a recharger.\nuser interface: Yeah, just where you're around something. Li Yeah, we had one example.\nindustrial designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well.\nuser interface: Mm. Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: Which w\nmarketing: but that's a round one. Maybe we can choose then.\nuser interface: Here you see one that's very round.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, okay.\nuser interface: So I think that can be all kind of shapes.\nproject manager: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. That's all.\nindustrial designer: Of the remote control?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah \nproject manager: Just round it up .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod . But \nproject manager: No. Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: More rounded. Yeah, I think it will just look like more like this one. Since it's This is also rounded.\nproject manager: No, just just the corners.\nuser interface: I think i\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Yeah okay, tho those are al already a bit cornered. Mm \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes.\nproject manager: Shapes.\nuser interface: Yeah okay, but then we have to think of something totally new.\nindustrial designer: Not in depth. Yeah, but Yeah, if if we want to make it kind of, yeah, new.\nuser interface: I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones. And all curves have already been done.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's a bit annoying, isn't it?\nmarketing: Yeah. What do we do wrong? Hmm. Just just more like this and not uh a square.\nuser interface: Yeah okay, yeah well \nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. I would do it \nuser interface: Yeah. I know we can do a lot more, but \nmarketing: Yeah, it \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Like in this kind of shape or \nmarketing: Uh it's very annoying. Okay.\nindustrial designer: I dunno. I dunno if it's handy.\nuser interface: I think it will only look more like the old remote controls.\nmarketing: Uh \nindustrial designer: This?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Curves, curves.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: You've more there as well.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: It wasn't very small one. very simple.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: That is for elderly.\nproject manager: So we have to make a decision, what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I don't know.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think if w My opinion. If we just uh take the iPod, and the same look.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: So uh light or just whatever colour, but the same light colours. And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: No rubber buttons or something. Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look. More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And you have the scroll button inside. Okay.\nuser interface: Yes. Just a simple scrollb\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? Of Skip that one as well.\nuser interface: Doesn't have to be.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah, it's cool.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, though that's a trend. If we want to make it. But yeah, I'm not a Trendwatcher, you are. So \nmarketing: Uh the t the trend is\nproject manager: Rubber spongy.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: spongy and fruity.\nuser interface: Yeah. No. Spongy\nmarketing: But yeah.\nindustrial designer: Spongeball kinda.\nuser interface: and \nmarketing: It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh \nproject manager: Okay, so we have s still one minute left. So just \nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Yeah,\nmarketing: It The th th\nindustrial designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But I I think it's still for older people. You j still have older people. It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that, like f Whatever. Just you have a normal \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we're we're aiming at a young public.\nmarketing: There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original, and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself. It must have uh uh uh a very different \nuser interface: Yeah, idea. But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now \nproject manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy. Because of the lights on the bottom of it. That's already fancy.\nuser interface: And if you make it look like the iPod \nmarketing: Yeah, they're all the same.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. So that's already a very big change\nproject manager: Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel. Make it in in yellow or something. Just like the colours of Real Reaction.\nuser interface: compared to \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: Ye yeah. Well uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah, we could do that.\nuser interface: Could.\nmarketing: Uh yeah, but uh if you the f uh front, the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: No, I think Oh.\nproject manager: It's right.\nuser interface: Think the scroll wheel won't be very big. Since if you put it uh somewhere, the chances that it will scroll are too big.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it will just be a small small scroll wheel. So it won't uh stick out much.\nproject manager: Yeah. Maybe the ones we are going to draw there. Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this. Because it doesn't work properly. So maybe you have to ask her.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. Well,\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: maybe we can just open images there, and I'll paint and paint.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah. That's probably \nuser interface: I'll be able to do a better job.\nmarketing: If you set the pen yeah, he will draw here. Doesn't work.\nproject manager: Okay, so just finish it. So we make it a bit like m that one probably. Yeah. Is that okay?\nmarketing: Yeah, I'll see it.\nuser interface: Bu Yeah, I agree more like iPod .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, only the colour and the flashy light and the \nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition.\nuser interface: Just a Speech. Yeah, do we s keep that? Yeah, I think \nproject manager: Or keep that? It's okay. But you'd definitely need a\nindustrial designer: S {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well uh\nproject manager: advanced chip.\nuser interface: then it w {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think so.\nmarketing: Uh \nindustrial designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and \nuser interface: Well that's very easy. We already have uh the beeping of the home station,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and I do I don't know anything about that.\nuser interface: so \nindustrial designer: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition,\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Uh strange that I received the information about that.\nindustrial designer: so \nmarketing: Oh that's hard. But \nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said. We have to be original and uh technological innovative. Becau\nproject manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well,\nmarketing: Yeah. But \nproject manager: okay?\nuser interface: So\nmarketing: Ma\nuser interface: shall we it open then?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So we can put all the \nproject manager: The function of that in there. Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then.\nindustrial designer: Fine. Yeah, we probably do.\nproject manager: But it doesn't say anything about it,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: does it?\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: Oh yeah, I \nmarketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost.\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: We started with information about the cost was now th\nuser interface: I just I just received the \nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh I have I have some some information about the cost. But just a about the chip.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: And how much is the chip? The the the \nindustrial designer: I don't know how much, but \nuser interface: Yeah, our division has developed a new speech recognition feature, the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit.\nindustrial designer: Just in inexpensive or \nuser interface: This is a very small electronic unit, will give a standard answer after it recognise a question.\nmarketing: And how how does it work? Is it \nuser interface: Doesn't say. Just You say record, followed by your question sample, and after a few seconds the answer uh sample. Because uh So it works like uh good morning remote control, and then the remote control says good morning.\nproject manager: It doesn't has to say anything. Just You have to just talk to \nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Yeah uh th that's just It's a \nmarketing: Does it say does it say something back?\nproject manager: Okay, we have to stop it now. So just \nuser interface: No. Yeah, it Well that's integrated in the chip, so if you use the speech recognition, that's in it.\nproject manager: Okay, that's a r That's that's a advanced \nindustrial designer: But i it's a separate chip.\nuser interface: I dunno, but if we use speech recognition, that will be in it as well.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I don't know anything about this,\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: Yeah, we just decide not to put it in,\nindustrial designer: but Nah.\nproject manager: because it's too difficult.\nindustrial designer: I dunno. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well it it would be would be a good feature feature.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, we just put it in, because it's a good feature.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We have to stop now.\nuser interface: No no worries about the cost, etcetera.\nproject manager: Okay, just \nuser interface: And there's a chip in it that will \nproject manager: We have to stop it now.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Fine.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "This meeting was about the functional design of the remote control.

Uh normally I was one of them.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Come on.\nproject manager: Hello.\nmarketing: Check check check check.\nproject manager: Oop.\nuser interface: Why won't it wake up? Is it on?\nmarketing: The power light doesn't work. You turned it off.\nuser interface: But how? Ah, there it is.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh.\nindustrial designer: I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials. So I'll discuss them with you.\nproject manager: Okay, we're just going to the later.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I received an email as well.\nproject manager: So we're going to talk about the conceptual model.\nmarketing: Oh.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: Hmm.\nuser interface: Which one was mine?\nproject manager: So that's me.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh okay. So Uh okay. Okay, so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes, minute. What's it called, I dunno. Whatever.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The minutes.\nproject manager: Okay, so we just talked about uh Oh you want me to show that there or \nuser interface: No,\nindustrial designer: Mm no.\nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: Okay,\nuser interface: just tell us.\nproject manager: we just talked about it looks. Has to look nice. Usability is very important. People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. Um It has to be very basic, not too many buttons. Light switches on if you use a button. Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility. And it has to be easy to learn. That were the things I uh make minutes of. And the functions are volume, channel to choose channels, an on-off, a mute uh button, and a text T_V_ button. That are the functions. That right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: So I just want to give you uh Mike again, the first uh presentation of your \nmarketing: Shall I start?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: No. Okay well I received an email Okay. I searched the web, uh and uh I searched uh on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market. It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe, I forget it. Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. So it's very important for us to create something new. So what Michael just said, it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. Uh this uh aspect is the most important one. Uh it came out of the research. It uh is twice important as the following. The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative. Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features. And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion, because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: But um this is the second uh important uh aspect, and I think uh we must use some of the new technology, to be uh innovative.\nproject manager: But we already have the flashing flashing light on the \nmarketing: Uh maybe maybe something new.\nuser interface: Yeah, more.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: We have to discuss about it s uh Okay, uh \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Well, I'll I'll get back on it.\nmarketing: features not uh do not exist in current remote controls. And that's very hard I think. Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. But uh that was an overall uh point. We already discussed that. Um I've got one picture. Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So I took uh that part of the webpage. And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy, yeah, uh have detected the following trends. This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us, maybe. But it's about uh clothes and shoes.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nmarketing: But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy.\nuser interface: Spongy.\nmarketing: But spongy, what what does spongy says?\nindustrial designer: Spongy.\nuser interface: Spongy, like sponge.\nmarketing: Spongy. Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So rubber, kind of.\nuser interface: Uh soft materials.\nproject manager: But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. So it has to be flexible.\nuser interface: Yeah, but Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah, it's something that uh it stand there. But I didn't knew uh knew what it means. So spongy means y Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's like a sponge.\nuser interface: Soft, sponge.\nmarketing: So it's also a stress-ball.\nproject manager: That's a good That's a good idea. If it's de like that. That's good, a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, somewhat like \nuser interface: Yeah, but Yeah.\nproject manager: Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control?\nuser interface: How are you gonna make it?\nproject manager: R_ soft.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: Uh \nindustrial designer: I've some uh material uh information, but I'll give you it later in my presentation.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What do I think? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control, I think about changeable fronts.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front. Because it's uh it's hot.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And uh some basic uh colour fronts. Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something. Uh maybe an extraordinary shape, like a sponge. Uh or uh, yeah, just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Just uh something round in it, or uh maybe not uh not uh Yeah, I dun dunno. We have to discuss about that. Uh y yeah. Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative. Yeah, how do we do that? Maybe speech?

That's the main problem.\nuser interface: I got f also an email from the the technology department.\nmarketing: So Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations.\nuser interface: They have done uh research about it, and uh even more possibilities now with speech.

{"fname": "product_test_94", "dialogue": "user interface: Well, we don't put put in any fancier technology yet.

No.\nindustrial designer: Nah, but they just said we need it.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh the battery contacts, like normal batteries ca you can put in.\nproject manager: Yeah, a recharger maybe.\nuser interface: Yeah, we have to make sure to uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah okay.\nproject manager: We still want to have a recharger, don't we?\nindustrial designer: Yeah but \nproject manager: Is that still the \nuser interface: Yes. Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it? Accu.\nproject manager: A recha Oh no. Uh Battery. It's just a battery. Yeah.\nuser interface: Re recharger. Base station.\nindustrial designer: Y uh just just batteries, rechargeable batteries.\nuser interface: Yeah, batteries. Yes, rechargeable batteries, I think's best.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Not a separate \nproject manager: No, just rechargeable batteries.\nindustrial designer: Okay. And uh a chip, that's this one.\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: Then uh I received some possibilities. Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch. So it operates on your wrist kinda.\nmarketing: Ah cool. Okay.\nproject manager: But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch.\nuser interface: So if you hold it, it gets powered.\nindustrial designer: If you hold it. Yeah, I don't think it will work, and Or we can also use solar cells. But you mostly use it indoors,\nproject manager: It's dark in the room. No.\nuser interface: \nproject manager: It's just batteries,\nindustrial designer: so \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: that's cheaper .\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and and we can use the home station kind of thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um cases, flat, so uncurved. Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back. And three D_ curved is also in depth.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So that's possible. Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls, we must use rubber buttons.\nuser interface: Mm. So\nindustrial designer: So we can't use the flat buttons.\nuser interface: we need uh two D_.\nproject manager: Yeah. Definitely.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think. Um these kinda materials can be used.\nproject manager: But it doesn't really matter, we just make it plastic.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think so too.\nproject manager: The scroll wheels, that's cool. That's for the volume.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, scroll wheels um \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's good. We can use multiple scroll wheels, w if we want to.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I think just the volume is enough.\nuser interface: Uh For channels it's not handy,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: because you scroll too fast.\nindustrial designer: And uh the L_C_D_. So we need uh the expensive, most expensive chip, if we use an L_C_D_.\nmarketing: Mm \nproject manager: I don't think that's an opportunity. Just skip it. Because we don't have time for that to to put it in.\nindustrial designer: Okay, then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip. So th so the regular chip. Because we use scroll wheels.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And um Yeah, that was it I guess.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh are are we using a a rubber case, or \nproject manager: Oh just sk\nindustrial designer: We haven't decided yet.\nproject manager: Maybe you have to skip that one as well. It's \nuser interface: Uh I don't think a rubber case looks \nindustrial designer: L\nmarketing: Uh but we have to do something about the trend.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, i it it should be soft. You said so?\nmarketing: The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay. That Uh fruit and veg, or \nmarketing: And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two.\nuser interface: Yeah, fruit and veg can be just the covers.\nmarketing: Uh yeah i Just Just on front.\nuser interface: So you can the the spongy yeah, I dunno. I can't imagine a soft remote control.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Neith uh I don't like it uh neither.\nproject manager: No. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I just can't imagine it.\nindustrial designer: So just hard plastic?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Titanium. It's mentioned here uh.\nindustrial designer: Titanium, uh I think it's too expensive.\nproject manager: But maybe the form has to be a bit different. Not the sh the square form. Just a bit\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: more rounded.\nindustrial designer: you can make it curved or mm round. But just in two D_, not in depth.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, that's right.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. What exactly. Because we have to know it. So the energy uh is the recharger.\nuser interface: \nproject manager: We already know that. Just a normal battery.\nuser interface: Yeah. We have batteries.\nproject manager: Okay. The chip-on-print is a normal one.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Regular.\nproject manager: Okay, the case is just a plastic one.\nindustrial designer: Yeah th yeah, the chip is the the regular one.\nproject manager: Yeah, re Yeah, regular. Yeah, okay. Yeah, regular.\nindustrial designer: You have the simple one, regular and advanced. So it's b should be regular uh the second.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I think I'll just check it.\nproject manager: And we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel. \nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: That's pretty much it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And a flashy light.\nuser interface: User interface concept.\nproject manager: So uh I'm not sure. But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment. But \nuser interface: I dunno either.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Or should we do it in the next meeting?\nuser interface: Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board.\nproject manager: Yeah. That's for the next one.\nindustrial designer: So we should did it here?\nproject manager: That's for th\nuser interface: So we're staying here?\nproject manager: Uh that I think that's the next next meeting.\nindustrial designer: Or should we do it in the next meeting? Okay.\nproject manager: But you definitely get a specific instruction. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But th think about something that's more rounded. Just And more It has to be \nuser interface: Yeah, uh I dunno. But the iPod and etcetera, M_P_ three players, mobile phones.\nproject manager: Uh a bit. Just just on the top or on the bottom.\nuser interface: Just a bit cur Okay, I'll see if I can see any of those.\nproject manager: Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this. O um if you draw it like this, you get a What the fuck is it? Okay. Mm Doesn't work. You see what I mean?\nindustrial designer: What?\nproject manager: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh. Okay.\nproject manager: Nah okay. Just . Maybe you can make it like this. And this is all the wheel for volume. So that you just um It's all rounded, so you can do uh turn this one.\nindustrial designer: Like a very big scroll-wheel. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but just not on the top, but uh on the side of it.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Maybe, I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Okay, so we have this at the moment.\nindustrial designer: I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted.\nuser interface: Yeah, you \nproject manager: Okay, so\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: we'd have this. Is that okay?\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: that's a little problem, of course, as well.\nindustrial designer: I think it's probably better.\nproject manager: And \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but maybe we can make a a plastic, so that you i if you like drop it, it won't change the volume. Only if you use your finger.\nuser interface: Yeah, maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy.\nproject manager: Like this. And uh what's the channel choose? Where do we uh put that? Still on the bottom\nindustrial designer: I think in middle.\nproject manager: or \nuser interface: Uh wh what is the middle part?\nproject manager: That's the numbers.\nuser interface: Numbers, okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle.\nuser interface: Yeah, I agree as well.\nproject manager: It doesn't make a difference, if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other.\nuser interface: Use the dz\nproject manager: Because you already have the volume here, so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there. Next to each other. back and forth.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's right.\nproject manager: So you can also can put it all on the top, and this, you keep this empty. Because you have to hold it as well.\nindustrial designer: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below.\nproject manager: But that's not want to zap very quick, so \nuser interface: Yeah, I think uh zapping is the highest priority.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah? Is this a opportunity,\nuser interface: And then you use those uh \nproject manager: or you don't want a different \nuser interface: Yeah, of course uh.\nindustrial designer: Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other, so \nproject manager: Why?\nindustrial designer: Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up \nproject manager: But still the next It's still the next one. Doesn't make \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up, and down button is If you put them \nproject manager: Yeah, but fo from left to right is exactly the same. It ma it doesn't make a big difference.\nuser interface: Yeah. I I think it's It's it's obvious, I think.\nindustrial designer: But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with uh channel changing.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's not not It's not al uh always the same.\nproject manager: But it's exactly th\nindustrial designer: In uh On most on most remote controls.\nmarketing: Every remote control's uh different.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think \nindustrial designer: So so if we use that, they will probably have a long learning uh time.\nproject manager: I dunno. I You already have the volume on the side,\nuser interface: No, uh I think \nproject manager: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So it's uh \nuser interface: I think it's s so simple\nindustrial designer: I dunno.\nuser interface: you just \nproject manager: So but that's for that's for you,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: 'cause it's \nuser interface: Yeah, okay I'll d I'll take a look at it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, so hmm. What did What else we have to discuss about? I dunno.\nuser interface: Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again?\nmarketing: Yeah, we have to care that it r uh looks really new. Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside.\nproject manager: And the LED.\nuser interface: No, you have uh It is \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but i i it should be round in in shape.\nuser interface: Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic.\nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: You have to look at that image of the iPod.\nmarketing: Yes. Okay.\nuser interface: More that uh kind of style.\nmarketing: And a bit uh \nuser interface: Not not the old grey black \nproject manager: Uh Yeah.\nmarketing: Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Where you can put a ve Uh we have If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo.\nproject manager: Yeah. Uh the logo was has to be on there. Yeah, that's right.\nmarketing: Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then? Uh five or something?\nproject manager: Yeah, five. Let's give five.\nuser interface: \nmarketing: Or more or \nuser interface: Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh \nmarketing: And um uh uh buy the product. You buy, you get one. And uh basic.\nuser interface: Yeah. Um\nmarketing: Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project.\nuser interface: I think Yeah. That's your choice, I think huh.\nindustrial designer: No, tha that will be \nproject manager: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? Is that is that a good good opportunity?\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: So you could put it like that,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so top down.\nproject manager: okay.\nindustrial designer: Hmm?\nmarketing: Yeah, you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station.\nindustrial designer: Do we have to design that w as well?\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh I'm not sure.\nindustrial designer: The docking station?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think so.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: But th Yeah, that can be very simple. Least.\nmarketing: Yeah, we can b It c it could be just just a square, just a packet.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just a recharger.\nuser interface: Yeah, just where you're around something. Li Yeah, we had one example.\nindustrial designer: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well.\nuser interface: Mm. Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: Which w\nmarketing: but that's a round one. Maybe we can choose then.\nuser interface: Here you see one that's very round.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, okay.\nuser interface: So I think that can be all kind of shapes.\nproject manager: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. That's all.\nindustrial designer: Of the remote control?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah \nproject manager: Just round it up .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod . But \nproject manager: No. Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: More rounded. Yeah, I think it will just look like more like this one. Since it's This is also rounded.\nproject manager: No, just just the corners.\nuser interface: I think i\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Yeah okay, tho those are al already a bit cornered. Mm \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes.\nproject manager: Shapes.\nuser interface: Yeah okay, but then we have to think of something totally new.\nindustrial designer: Not in depth. Yeah, but Yeah, if if we want to make it kind of, yeah, new.\nuser interface: I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones. And all curves have already been done.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's a bit annoying, isn't it?\nmarketing: Yeah. What do we do wrong? Hmm. Just just more like this and not uh a square.\nuser interface: Yeah okay, yeah well \nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. I would do it \nuser interface: Yeah. I know we can do a lot more, but \nmarketing: Yeah, it \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Like in this kind of shape or \nmarketing: Uh it's very annoying. Okay.\nindustrial designer: I dunno. I dunno if it's handy.\nuser interface: I think it will only look more like the old remote controls.\nmarketing: Uh \nindustrial designer: This?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Curves, curves.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: You've more there as well.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: It wasn't very small one. very simple.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: That is for elderly.\nproject manager: So we have to make a decision, what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I don't know.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think if w My opinion. If we just uh take the iPod, and the same look.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: So uh light or just whatever colour, but the same light colours. And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: No rubber buttons or something. Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look. More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And you have the scroll button inside. Okay.\nuser interface: Yes. Just a simple scrollb\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? Of Skip that one as well.\nuser interface: Doesn't have to be.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah, it's cool.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, though that's a trend. If we want to make it. But yeah, I'm not a Trendwatcher, you are. So \nmarketing: Uh the t the trend is\nproject manager: Rubber spongy.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: spongy and fruity.\nuser interface: Yeah. No. Spongy\nmarketing: But yeah.\nindustrial designer: Spongeball kinda.\nuser interface: and \nmarketing: It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh \nproject manager: Okay, so we have s still one minute left. So just \nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Yeah,\nmarketing: It The th th\nindustrial designer: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But I I think it's still for older people. You j still have older people. It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that, like f Whatever. Just you have a normal \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we're we're aiming at a young public.\nmarketing: There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original, and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself. It must have uh uh uh a very different \nuser interface: Yeah, idea. But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now \nproject manager: But i it is it is it is already fancy. Because of the lights on the bottom of it. That's already fancy.\nuser interface: And if you make it look like the iPod \nmarketing: Yeah, they're all the same.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. So that's already a very big change\nproject manager: Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel. Make it in in yellow or something. Just like the colours of Real Reaction.\nuser interface: compared to \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: Ye yeah. Well uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah, we could do that.\nuser interface: Could.\nmarketing: Uh yeah, but uh if you the f uh front, the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: No, I think Oh.\nproject manager: It's right.\nuser interface: Think the scroll wheel won't be very big. Since if you put it uh somewhere, the chances that it will scroll are too big.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it will just be a small small scroll wheel. So it won't uh stick out much.\nproject manager: Yeah. Maybe the ones we are going to draw there. Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this. Because it doesn't work properly. So maybe you have to ask her.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. Well,\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: maybe we can just open images there, and I'll paint and paint.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah. That's probably \nuser interface: I'll be able to do a better job.\nmarketing: If you set the pen yeah, he will draw here. Doesn't work.\nproject manager: Okay, so just finish it. So we make it a bit like m that one probably. Yeah. Is that okay?\nmarketing: Yeah, I'll see it.\nuser interface: Bu Yeah, I agree more like iPod .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, only the colour and the flashy light and the \nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition.\nuser interface: Just a Speech. Yeah, do we s keep that? Yeah, I think \nproject manager: Or keep that? It's okay. But you'd definitely need a\nindustrial designer: S {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well uh\nproject manager: advanced chip.\nuser interface: then it w {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think so.\nmarketing: Uh \nindustrial designer: And we we have to build in a microphone and \nuser interface: Well that's very easy. We already have uh the beeping of the home station,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and I do I don't know anything about that.\nuser interface: so \nindustrial designer: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition,\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Uh strange that I received the information about that.\nindustrial designer: so \nmarketing: Oh that's hard. But \nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said. We have to be original and uh technological innovative. Becau\nproject manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well,\nmarketing: Yeah. But \nproject manager: okay?\nuser interface: So\nmarketing: Ma\nuser interface: shall we it open then?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So we can put all the \nproject manager: The function of that in there. Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then.\nindustrial designer: Fine. Yeah, we probably do.\nproject manager: But it doesn't say anything about it,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: does it?\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: Oh yeah, I \nmarketing: But we don't have any f information about the cost.\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: We started with information about the cost was now th\nuser interface: I just I just received the \nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh I have I have some some information about the cost. But just a about the chip.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: And how much is the chip? The the the \nindustrial designer: I don't know how much, but \nuser interface: Yeah, our division has developed a new speech recognition feature, the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit.\nindustrial designer: Just in inexpensive or \nuser interface: This is a very small electronic unit, will give a standard answer after it recognise a question.\nmarketing: And how how does it work? Is it \nuser interface: Doesn't say. Just You say record, followed by your question sample, and after a few seconds the answer uh sample. Because uh So it works like uh good morning remote control, and then the remote control says good morning.\nproject manager: It doesn't has to say anything. Just You have to just talk to \nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Yeah uh th that's just It's a \nmarketing: Does it say does it say something back?\nproject manager: Okay, we have to stop it now. So just \nuser interface: No. Yeah, it Well that's integrated in the chip, so if you use the speech recognition, that's in it.\nproject manager: Okay, that's a r That's that's a advanced \nindustrial designer: But i it's a separate chip.\nuser interface: I dunno, but if we use speech recognition, that will be in it as well.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I don't know anything about this,\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: Yeah, we just decide not to put it in,\nindustrial designer: but Nah.\nproject manager: because it's too difficult.\nindustrial designer: I dunno. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well it it would be would be a good feature feature.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, we just put it in, because it's a good feature.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We have to stop now.\nuser interface: No no worries about the cost, etcetera.\nproject manager: Okay, just \nuser interface: And there's a chip in it that will \nproject manager: We have to stop it now.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Fine.", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion about remote control features.", "zh_query": "总结有关遥控器特点的讨论。", "fr_query": "Résumez la discussion sur les fonctions de contrôle à distance.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте обговорення функцій пульту дистанційного керування.", "en_summary": "The group decided to have the normal batteries, the scroll wheel with rubber buttons together with back-lights, the beeping of the home station, the round shape as well as the speech recognition with an advanced chip.

If we're doing uh if we're doing a display.\nuser interface: Yeah okay. So we Well we can I had uh to make a sort of a design. So I did some searching on the internet. I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls. I think we should um This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players. Mobile phones.\nproject manager: Yeah, just modern modern but still uh basic.\nuser interface: More modern. Y yes. Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller. 'Cause remote con control, you can see it here, you have to bo reach both out both sides. And here you just have one, few buttons. So that's that's the main difference. But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this. And then changeable fonts, so \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: It's the most important part, I think. But And the home base is something like that, something simple. Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit. Uh basic buttons. On-off, mute. And th maybe two others, I dunno. Text buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe the teletext tel\nuser interface: Yeah, text button, maybe there and there. And then the colour buttons, if we want it on. I don't find it very usable,\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: but it's \nmarketing: No, I don't uh I don't like it.\nuser interface: Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well. So \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: and then yeah we saw the the pla display, in the the iPod. They can put the basic buttons, one, two, three, four. And uh f above ten. And I think \nindustrial designer: But it That's on on the display.\nuser interface: No no. That th there is no display there. But it's on the place of the display. And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So the focus is on these two parts.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So you don't see all the buttons you else need.\nproject manager: But it sounds very difficult to use.

Is that correct?\nindustrial designer: That's correct.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here. Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan, uh and we will have a discussion. Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes, so we should keep that in mind.\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um is there any room for a little presentation? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section?\nproject manager: There is? Yeah, there is.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: No problem.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um okay, this new product we are are g are going to develop, um it's a remote control, a television remote control. Um and first of all it should be original, it should be trendy and user-friendly. Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals, um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop. Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: The market, we should have a look at the market. Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development, um which consists of three different design stages. Uh the functional design, the conceptual design and the detailed design, um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work, prepare, and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the  the the progressions, yes.\nuser interface: Progressions. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um the first stage, the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements, and we will um make a specific uh specification of that. Um the second is the technical functional design, um what effect should the remote have? Well in this case control t the the television I think.\nuser interface: It's for the vision. Yeah.\nproject manager: Um and the last one is the working design. How exactly does it work in the technical sense. Um the other design stages, uh we will discuss that later. So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design. Okay, um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here. Um as you see now I can give a presentation. Um it's also possible to use this one as well. You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to. Um to um presentate, to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder, which is on your desktop, at least it should be. Um then we have this electronic white-board system. Um yeah, I will show that now. Um you can draw on the board using this pen. There are little um uh\nuser interface: Sensors.\nproject manager: sensors, so do not grab it here, but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end. Um well, it it's on the um eraser now, so we click the pen button. Okay, so not too fast writing. Um you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button. It's quite the same. Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file. So do not m make a new file. Just use this one uh during the day. Um you can use the eraser to make something go away.\nuser interface: But we all use the same white-board file\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: So we can work together on it while we're \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings?\nproject manager: Yeah, in the meetings, only in the meetings.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard.\nuser interface: Yeah, alright. Yep.\nproject manager: Um you can choose the format, um sorry. Uh Let me see. Um Well I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected. Yep. Current colour, you can choose another colour. And um for example black, and you c I can choose the line width. Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour. Okay. Quite easy, if you uh do have any questions, just c ask me. Um to um oh well, I'm I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us. Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay. Um green.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: An animal. Okay. Um \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh a wee rabbit.\nuser interface: It's a bunny. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: A rabbit. Okay, well great.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um Roo, could you do the same please? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width.\nuser interface: But of course, Flores.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Blank.\nproject manager: Sebastian is thinking about the animal.\nindustrial designer: I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, I'm think about it too. Format . Well, it looked more than a bunny than a cat, but it works,\nindustrial designer: Well, I'll give it a try. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: It it should be a cat.\nuser interface: right?\nproject manager: Okay?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: I'm guessing a horse.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Very good. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: With a very small legs. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I was very good in drawing. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You should feed that uh that animal. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, I guess you uh get the idea. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes, okay. Beautiful.\nindustrial designer: Beautiful.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to. Um any questions well, just just let me know. Um okay, back to our project. Um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros. Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros, which is quite a number. Um\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we uh we will focus this internationally, so the product will be sold um, if there is market uh interest, uh in in more than one country. And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty, so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development, um because uh, well, those are important numbers. Um then the discussion, maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation.\nindustrial designer: Yes, um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion, because uh there might be some uh\nproject manager: Limitations.\nindustrial designer: influations influences.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay, great.\nindustrial designer: Okay? Okay. Um first about my role, role of the Industrial Designer. I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things, and the technical possibilities and impossibilities. So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas, uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions, but uh there might be some impossibilities. So that's one. Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that, but well, these are quite the same. Sorry about that. Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion. One thing about uh interopera operability. Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment. Uh for instance, uh D_V_D_ players, cell phones, video and audio equipment. So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment.\nuser interface: And for a cell phone?\nindustrial designer: Well, there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think it could come in handy. We should discuss that. Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other. We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore, so infrared is not uh\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore. But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth.\nuser interface: But Yeah, but the infrared, it's uh, well, a little bit old-fashioned, if you would call it like that.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared, so\nindustrial designer: But it's cost-effective. Yes. Mm-hmm. Well, not all, not all.\nuser interface: y you you can Most of them.\nindustrial designer: So that's the point.\nuser interface: Or you shou sh use a \nindustrial designer: So \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote.\nindustrial designer: Maybe, but that's uh something we should discuss\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and uh about every everybody should think about it. So that's just my role, I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input, and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but take these things into account when you start the discussion.\nproject manager: Okay, so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability,\nindustrial designer: Yes,\nproject manager: and \nindustrial designer: so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment,\nproject manager: Okay, and and uh \nindustrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay, good.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Um that was your presentation? Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: That's it.\nproject manager: Um okay. Great. Um I'll go back to my own presentation. Um Mm. Okay. Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications. Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy, which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role. Um the way how it should be controlled by the user, which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part. Um so let's start with you.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: H how do you think the remote should um function for the user?\nuser interface: Well, I had a few uh things in mind. Um well, the interoperability, just like uh Sebastian said, um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um Yeah uh, what is it, devices?\nproject manager: Yep.\nuser interface: Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store.\nindustrial designer: Yes, I think it should be something like that.\nuser interface: It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product,\nproject manager: Okay, so we're we're going business to consumer,\nuser interface: right?\nproject manager: not we're we're it's not a \nuser interface: Yeah, I do I don't know that. It's no I have uh don't have the information for it.\nindustrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor, are we?\nproject manager: No. No.\nindustrial designer: No,\nuser interface: No, okay.\nindustrial designer: we're just developing this product, and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public, so it should fit to every device.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh Ruud, y do you agree?\nmarketing: Yeah, I think I think they're right, yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: Um Well, the techni fu technical function uh  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_. That's just the basic f technical function.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So that was my really my part for uh this session. Um \nproject manager: So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um \nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well, that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do, wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: It just should change the T_V_'s state.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So that's it. Um but furthermore \nindustrial designer: And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this?\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah, with buttons.\nindustrial designer: Or are there any o other controls?\nuser interface: Yeah, or maybe you want a touch-screen or \nindustrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well, {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But \nindustrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward, sidewords.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: You know these things. And um it's very easy for a user to to switch \nuser interface: They're very vu vulnerable.\nindustrial designer: w yes,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_, on on a chapters, you know, on a D_V_D_ player. So maybe that's an idea,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't know.\nuser interface: And for other user interface I had um, well, it's more industrial thing. Uh point at a T_V_, I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: so you must point everywhere, so maybe infrared is \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Maybe not even pointed. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, just don't even point it, so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that.\nproject manager: Okay\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Uh \nindustrial designer: Uh is that uh are there restriction for the range, the operating range too? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited.\nuser interface: Yeah, if you g if you go to radio or or yeah. For T_V_, you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_, so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: but if you want to uh get it working with a radio, and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker, then maybe the range should be uh \nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay, gentlemen, um uh just a reminder, we d we have five minutes left for this meeting\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: But Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: um \nuser interface: Two more things.\nproject manager: okay.\nuser interface: Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons, so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand.\nproject manager: Okay, s yeah.\nuser interface: You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are, so it should be visible al um in dark too.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So when it's dark \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Those are two really uh user interface \nproject manager: Uh I'll write down glow in the dark. Is tha {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.  That's perfect. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay, um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting.\nindustrial designer: Do do you \nproject manager: Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product?\nmarketing: Uh I think most most things have already been said, like uh control multiple devices.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: And uh, yeah, infrared might be an issue.\nproject manager: Because?\nmarketing: Uh well, he said about n abo what he said about pointing.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But uh lots of devices already use infrared. So we'll probably have to implement that.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay. Okay, Sebastian, did you have any other ideas?\nindustrial designer: Um well yes, I had, uh about three minutes ago,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them. Um oh yes, I remember. Um you said something about visibility in the dark.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control, on which you can see functions? Which makes it easier to operate it.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well, maybe I um but it it can be quite simple,\nindustrial designer: I I don't know.\nuser interface: you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nuser interface: The uh the the digits in black.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh then it's already visible in dark. So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: well, it can be for design, of course.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah, okay, because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product. So \nindustrial designer: Yes, but there's a cost limitation too.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Well, that's more \nproject manager: twelve Euro fifty, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So that's a big problem, I think. I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: The cost price is very low.\nuser interface: Just remind something.\nindustrial designer: Um \nuser interface: The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade.\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nuser interface: You have a m uh \nindustrial designer: Okay. Very good point. Yeah.\nuser interface: Always have s the soft buttons, always uh clear the the the paint on it. The marks.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay, um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now. Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nproject manager: um or it should not consume too much um power. Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or \nuser interface: But um Necessary, yeah.\nproject manager: yeah. I dunno, it's uh that's more Sebastian's uh um \nuser interface: Yeah. But then Bluetooth uh might be problem.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh \nindustrial designer: It's use uh a lot of uh \nproject manager: Well does it?\nuser interface: Yeah, I know it from the cell phone.\nindustrial designer: well \nproject manager: I'm not sure. Uh \nindustrial designer: Well, cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and, well, it's it seems to work uh quite okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So uh technically it will be possible.\nuser interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time, twenty four hours a day.\nproject manager: Okay. Gentlemen, I'm afraid we do not have any more time.\nuser interface: Does it \nindustrial designer: No, you cannot.\nuser interface: It's over?\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: so we will go back to our own uh work. Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um, well, you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it. Um so this was it.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: See you in thirty minutes.\nuser interface: Great.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "This is the kick-off meeting of the new television remote control project.

Yeah?\nindustrial designer: It is.\nuser interface: Okay, great.\nmarketing: Uh okay.\nproject manager: Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product, on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control, so keep that in mind. Um we have forty minutes. So it's now Yep. Okay. Um the new project requirements, first of all, um we didn't speak about it, but we should not um support teletext in the remote, um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext. So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product. It's a board decision. Um the remote control should only be used for television, because it's not uh f uh feasible, it's not uh w\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with.\nuser interface: Time, yeah.\nproject manager: Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty, which is important for you, uh Ruud, and as well for uh Roo. Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty. Um then for Roo, as well uh important, the corporate image should be recognisable in our product. So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product.\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: Is that clear? Any questions on these requirements? No? Okay. Um the individual presentations, I th um Roo or Sebastian, who of you would like to start?\nuser interface: Yeah, I'll start.\nproject manager: Uh uh yeah. Okay,\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: great.\nuser interface: Um Oh, how can I uh Geez, and sli and show. Um Just uh press it.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh yes. Alright. Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion. Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set. So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls, the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities, but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um but um yeah. My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control, because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design. But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design. But it should b I think it should be a combination, but teletext buttons are not uh in our design. So it should uh take out, well, eight buttons or so. But my in my opinion, the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh Ruud, did you get that?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, uh b uh most.\nproject manager: Okay, so\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: the important thing here is \nuser interface: And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic.\nmarketing: Oh, user-friendly.\nproject manager: In the market, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, what what does the market want? I I don't know.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay, w we will s we all uh \nuser interface: Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay. Sebastian.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Excuse me. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Scusi. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um Okay, it's still the right thing. Okay. Um well, there are some changes in the design requirements, so there are some changes in the method also.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set. And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set. Well, I th I tried to uh implement a picture here,\nuser interface: Energies and uh \nindustrial designer: but it's hardly readable. Can you see it?\nproject manager: No, it's not visible.\nindustrial designer: No? Well Um, there's a energy source here. And um basically there it's connected to three things. The user interface connected to a chip, which is connected to the sender, which generates messages using uh infrared light, which are sent to the receiver. That's basically the idea. And there's a little picture, just for your imagination, how a device like this should look or can look. Okay. Um what have I found. Usually these kind of things consist of a battery, infrared diode, buttons, chips, and circuit board. That's all. It's cased together, nothing more than that. It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There are some exceptions, but most of all have uh infrared controls. And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons. And I think that's what we w\nuser interface: The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed.\nindustrial designer: yes. In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also. So maybe we should consider that. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay. I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented. Um basically this is all there is. There's just one chip. There are a few buttons connected. Uh the buttons are lit. And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode, and there is not a power source here. So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment.\nproject manager: So it's fairly easy.\nindustrial designer: There's nothing more to it. It's fairly easy. It's been done many times before,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Succeed in it also.\nindustrial designer: and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay,\nindustrial designer: So Okay, so uh\nproject manager: good.\nindustrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared, because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set. So I think that uh should be clear.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse, friendly components. Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components. And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design, we should really implement them. Um for cost-effectiveness, we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board, um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques, blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff.\nuser interface: And what's the um \nindustrial designer: I think our uh users will really uh will really like that.\nuser interface: if we use the LEDs, i does it use much more energy or \nindustrial designer: No, they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So we can use them. So that's no problem.\nuser interface: For the same costs, it's can be uh in our \nindustrial designer: Uh no, they're uh they're a little bit more expensive, but by uh um um making \nuser interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh \nindustrial designer: We can we can make its I think.\nmarketing: Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most. So, the channel switching.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques, I guess.\nmarketing: Or \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: But I think \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's the same as in the cell phone, just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons,\nmarketing: Hmm, true. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and not for \nindustrial designer: Yes. Well, it's not one light, it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device.\nuser interface: Yeah, but not for each button one LED, I think.\nindustrial designer: No no no, no. That's right, that's right.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So well, this uh should be it.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um have a think about it.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, Ruud.\nmarketing: Oh, mine is already outdated.\nproject manager: Okay well,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product.\nmarketing: Since uh \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So any income is welcome. Input.\nmarketing: Okay, make Well Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units. Of  of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Could you step a little bit more to the right? Yeah, thank you. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market, I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market. But uh since uh the requirements changed, that's uh not a good idea.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well, skip this. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, it's this till true, of course. That they only use ten percent the buttons. The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times, when uh the power button is only used one time. And the volume button's only four times. So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons. And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them. Some uh audio signal. Like uh home phones.\nproject manager: Okay. Well, that's interesting.\nmarketing: Or \nindustrial designer: Or a find a finding function,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: you know.\nproject manager: that's definitely interesting.\nindustrial designer: That's quite a yes.\nproject manager: It uh it separates our product from others uh as well.\nuser interface: Sound signal.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: go on.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: Well, I just said that. And uh well, this obvious, and he also said it.\nproject manager: Okay. So that's what the market tells us.\nmarketing: Uh that's about it, yes.\nproject manager: Yep. Okay.\nuser interface: The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used.\nmarketing: Uh mo uh zap buttons most.\nuser interface: So \nmarketing: Volume, they are uh use a lot. But more than all the other buttons. So \nuser interface: Yeah, well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons. And first um \nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes, we should focus on that, I guess.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Well, the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties. There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment. So um I don't think we have any hiccups there. So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs. So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal.\nuser interface: Yeah, the sound signal. Just one thing I'm just wondering, the sound signal, from where do you execute th the s sound?\nindustrial designer: Well\nmarketing: Yeah, that's uh a problem. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yes. Th that's a bit of that's a problem.\nuser interface: Another device is not a solution.\nproject manager: Well\nindustrial designer: Usually \nproject manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands,\nuser interface: It should be uh uh \nproject manager: like um turning on and off the the the lights.\nindustrial designer: Oh yes.\nuser interface: Yeah, but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Well, there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already. Um there are video sets and um they have a special button, the find the remote control button. You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound, and your uh remote controls then start to beep.\nproject manager: Reports rep respend response to it.\nindustrial designer: And um \nuser interface: just like uh the phones Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes, that's it. Yes, same thing.\nuser interface: the \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But uh th\nuser interface: But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons. Uh \nindustrial designer: No, so we we should use something else.\nmarketing: And you \nproject manager: Yeah, because we do not have a a a a a home um \nuser interface: But I believe you will have an \nmarketing: Yeah, and usually \nindustrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well.\nmarketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button, uh you would have to walk to your T_V_,\nindustrial designer: Yes, m yes. S and we b we want to make so it's  is easy as possible for our customers,\nmarketing: and it's \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so we should think about \nproject manager: So what about the clapping technique? Um because you se\nuser interface: I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us.\nindustrial designer: It's quite complicated. Well, it's quite complicated. Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds.\nmarketing: And b\nproject manager: Well, you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh \nindustrial designer: Yes, yes. Well, basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume, the amplitude of the sound,\nproject manager: Yeah, a peak. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control.\nmarketing: So if if you'd be watching a movie, it would constantly beep.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's true.\nindustrial designer: Yes,\nuser interface: But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_. Just a little antenna or uh something.\nindustrial designer: so we don't want that.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe we can Something like that.\nuser interface: Well if you lost th\nindustrial designer: Well,\nproject manager: Well uh \nindustrial designer: is there not something f something more easily \nuser interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote.\nindustrial designer: Well, I don't think uh .\nuser interface: Uh that's just uh \nindustrial designer: No, and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so w we should use have uh we should use something like that. You do not want another device, which can be uh everywhere in the house, which you have to find first before you can find your remote control.\nuser interface: just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility.\nindustrial designer: Yes, something like that. But that will be very costly, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function, if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things.\nindustrial designer: So that's not a good idea.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. I will.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: because that's his his field of expertise.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes. But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: um and it will become more costly also.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used. And there are some implepe imp\nuser interface: And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs, the lightning uh function?\nindustrial designer: Well, I I think so, because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control, you cannot see it.\nuser interface: It's a unique item uh \nproject manager: Yeah, it's a distinction in the market.\nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: It will be an a unique feature of our remote control.\nproject manager: It's a different exactly. It's an uni an unique feature,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights.\nuser interface: And just about uh the user interface, I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: What should we choose in in design?\nproject manager: Yeah. Well, um according to Ruud, um people do not use um all the extra features very very often.\nuser interface: Well, the extra functions.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Well, t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function.\nuser interface: Used option.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, we we do have a wise board, so I'm not questioning that. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well yeah, channel selection is obviously the most important.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection, the volume selection and the teletext.\nmarketing: So Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Well, we skip that.\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Well, so it just th the basic functions. And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff.\nindustrial designer: No, no.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: So {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nope.\nindustrial designer: So that's out of the question.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Just through uh the easy uh design. We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one.\nindustrial designer: I think also. Yes. Well,\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay,\nindustrial designer: and \nproject manager: Ruud, how do you feel about that? Uh do you agree, do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple \nmarketing: Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: 'cause young people uh like new features.\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's right.\nproject manager: Okay, so this is is kind of uh \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Uh just a few buttons, trendy design, nice lightning effects wh and the sound.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Well, is it maybe there's another possibility. You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment, but it's quite elaborated, uh because it has many functions.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly, easy to catch piece of equipment, but um nevertheless \nproject manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons, no display, um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ok like that. Well, I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling, by by these kinds of sticks or something like that. I don't know if if it's user-friendly. That's your field of expertise.\nproject manager: But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is?\nuser interface: Yeah, I don't know yet. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Because we do not implement uh a user history.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. There's no, but there's no way to do that, because we cannot implement that kind of the system.\nproject manager: I know, but but if we use uh like a stick, for example, um \nindustrial designer: W Mm-hmm. Well, maybe we can use a light for that. When you move the stick to a to a position, maybe uh a light next to it can lit up. So you know I've just uh pushed the button, or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume. Something like that.\nmarketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection, you have the m two most important functions in one uh button.\nproject manager: Yeah. Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick, uh like many cell phones, just a round m well,\nproject manager: Yeah, draw draw it on the board.\nuser interface: should we just use a Um it's already uh oh, we have a blank. Oh.\nindustrial designer: yeah, something like that. Oh\nuser interface: It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions. Instead of a stick.\nindustrial designer: It's not really a stick, but Yes. Yes.\nuser interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down\nproject manager: Yeah, it can break down.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: or uh\nindustrial designer: Yes, yes.\nuser interface: just a round uh button should be the trick, I think.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And Yes, and this also looks more fancy, I think.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public, I think.\nmarketing: A younger uh Huh.\nindustrial designer: But you're the marketing man.\nmarketing: And it's also quite easy to use, so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new, and it might attract older people because it's easy to use.\nuser interface: Geez. Well, volume and something uh like that. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-huh. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The programme up and down. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, yeah.\nuser interface: And the vol yeah, the pen doesn't uh really does what I want.\nindustrial designer: Okay, that's good.\nproject manager: Okay, but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options. Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques. Um however, uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things. We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: But I think our our next step to look at is just that. So I don't think it's um we have something to do. Uh we can't discuss it right now, because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that, I think.\nproject manager: Um well, for we do have to uh decide this this meeting. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yes?\nproject manager: We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: but teletext is so uh is just scrapped. 'Kay,\nindustrial designer: Okay. Do do you want a list of functions? Do you want an explicit list? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device?\nproject manager: Um well, I do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list, but I want um the kind of functions, for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: The ten digits.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Well, for example, that that's what we should think about. l how is the remote going to look? Not not in the user interface, but \nuser interface: Oh, and just one function. The the the the programme to programme button, the switch to uh two channels, when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six, just one button which which can uh change\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yes.\nproject manager: Yeah. A bit of a split mode.\nindustrial designer: Change.\nproject manager: Uh l like Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes, yes.\nproject manager: Dual channel watch.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Okay, well um\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: m maybe I should write that down. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: you're the secretary. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh Ruud, um what's your last name?\nmarketing: Mielsen.\nproject manager: Mielsen, because I I was writing it down in the last uh Mielsen. Right. Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder. So if you want to have a look at it, you know where to find it. Um \nindustrial designer: Mm okay,\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it, because it's starting to fill up already. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, that's that's \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: if you want to do it, Sebastian. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh \nindustrial designer: Sure. . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, um Okay, so so um uh \nuser interface: \nproject manager: Volume. Programme. Uh dual channel. Uh \nindustrial designer: Yes, that's important.\nproject manager: And and do we want um the ten digits?\nuser interface: The ten digits? Yeah, I believe so.\nindustrial designer: Well, are are you sure?\nmarketing: Well, if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button.\nindustrial designer: I'm not so sure.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well, that's complicated,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but is that so relevant? Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that. If it were so.\nuser interface: I wouldn't buy it personally. A remote control without the ten digits.\nindustrial designer: Okay,\nuser interface: Uh and I think the most \nindustrial designer: I can imagine when\nproject manager: I agree actually. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it,\nindustrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have, well, about six hundred channels, I can imagine you want this.\nmarketing: Well \nuser interface: but \nindustrial designer: But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user, and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks, well, you can uh  you can use uh about ten buttons. That's enough.\nproject manager: But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels.\nmarketing: But \nuser interface: Yep. The older people only use five of them.\nindustrial designer: Well,\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels?\nmarketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience, they will probably watch more channels than the older people.\nproject manager: Often.\nindustrial designer: No, you're probably right.\nmarketing: So \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay. But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull. Don't you think?\nproject manager: Well, it depends on the on the on the looks, on the on the \nindustrial designer: The design.\nuser interface: On the design.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Well, y then there should be should done be done something specific with it.\nmarketing: Well \nproject manager: You c you can d make them very fancy\nmarketing: And \nproject manager: by um I mean Nokia, they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So I'm I'm I do not agree \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour, that kind of thing.\nproject manager: Exactly, exactly.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it. Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement, but it would be a solution uh for \nproject manager: Okay, speech.\nindustrial designer: Well, maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control, uh it's very easy to change uh the channel. That's one thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And it's very easy uh to find your remote control.\nproject manager: To find yeah.\nindustrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility, but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh If if we would um drop the ten digits\nindustrial designer: But maybe when we uh \nproject manager: but keep the programme and the volume,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because maybe people do not always want to use their voice, um \nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay, okay.\nmarketing: Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition. So then we should implement such a but\nproject manager: Yeah. But we do focus on younger people. We d it it's a board uh decision.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Well. I I think it should uh should work, it sh we should manage that.\nuser interface: So\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Well, the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage. It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So that's that's a big advantage, I think.\nproject manager: Okay, g good.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this. Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult. So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: But maybe can we we can think something smart about it.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room, it charges itself.\nproject manager: But But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs?\nindustrial designer: You have to do nothing for it.\nmarketing: M {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Twelve dollar fifty. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Because it seems like a very {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe, maybe not.\nmarketing: And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge, then there wouldn't be uh a big problem.\nindustrial designer: I'll have to find that out. Yes. So No, that's very cheap.\nmarketing: 'Cause when \nproject manager: Is a cradle very cheap?\nindustrial designer: It's Oh, it's very cheap. That's no problem. It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts.\nproject manager: I know, b uh but there should be an adapter as well.\nindustrial designer: It's Yes, but they're they're mass production.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: They're very cheap.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So it will cost us p practically nothing.\nproject manager: Okay. We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting. Um I would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about, yeah, but that are important. Uh Ruud, you you came up with the voice recognition uh data. Uh are there other things about the market we should know?\nmarketing: Um I think we dealt with the most important information. Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to. So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: But with uh buttons like that, which are easy to use, we uh might attract them too. So I don't think that's a big problem\nproject manager: Okay. Okay, so\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh Profitable. We we yeah, we still need to take in account the the bit older people.\nmarketing: Yes. Yeah, profitable.\nindustrial designer: Profitable.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: O okay. Um Roo.  Nothing to add.\nuser interface: I have nothing uh nothing to add, I think.\nproject manager: Sebastian?\nindustrial designer: Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities. Um\nproject manager: Yeah? Great.\nindustrial designer: so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design. So on the outside it looks easy, but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside. So that's one the those are the choices we have to make. But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques, uh voice recognition, that these kinds of things.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um it makes it also more uh attractable, I think, to our uh audience. Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages, and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques, which uh I think our customers will like. The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime, energy saving.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons. If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition, uh our circuit board will become even more cheap. So that's another \nproject manager: Yeah, and that was the main issue, right? The the board \nindustrial designer: well, it wa it w it was an issue, but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And this even uh makes it more cheapy.\nuser interface: But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: The board.\nuser interface: The circuit board.\nindustrial designer: The circuit board.\nuser interface: The fewer buttons you can use on it.\nproject manager: No, it's th\nindustrial designer: The fewer buttons you have, the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board, yes.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: It's the other way around, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit, a chip. So that's that's another advantage.\nproject manager: It shouldn't be a big issue.\nuser interface: Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition.\nindustrial designer: So Yes, because I don't know Yes. I d I really don't know. So \nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: It can be costly. Maybe not.\nproject manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs, I will have a look at it. Maybe you will get some information on that.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Um I'm not sure how how that \nindustrial designer: Yes, I al I I hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yep.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, great. Um well, I think we're qui quite done.\nuser interface: We're done, I think.\nproject manager: Um for now we will have the lunch break.\nindustrial designer: How nice.\nproject manager: Um I'm don't know how long the break will be, but we'll find out.\nuser interface: Me neither.\nproject manager: Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work, uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it. Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder. If you want to look at it um well, just do. Um the Interface Designer, um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept.\nuser interface: Interface industrial.\nproject manager: Uh I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: User Interface Designer, uh Roo, I would like to see the user interface c uh concept.\nindustrial designer: Well, we understand. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And um\nuser interface: Uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes. About the voice recognition.\nindustrial designer: Well {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, i it should be easy,\nuser interface: Well \nproject manager: that's w w what we concluded. It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons. S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one. And um um yeah, some some fancy lights.\nindustrial designer: Mm yes.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I think that's what we decided.\nindustrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition?\nproject manager: No no no, we didn't \nindustrial designer: Or \nproject manager: but it shouldn't be integrated \nindustrial designer: Oh.\nproject manager: yeah, it's of course it's user interface, but um i I was talking about really the design of the \nindustrial designer: Okay. Well um do we really have to decide now\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: or can we decide next meeting?\nproject manager: We can decide the next meeting. Yep.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Because I'll have some updated info on that uh \nproject manager: Yeah. I guess all of you have i updated info. I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching.\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: And I'm sure the market will um uh uh will change, adapt\nmarketing: Hmm.\nuser interface: Adapt.\nindustrial designer: Adapt.\nmarketing: Left.\nproject manager: and um so\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: we will see that. Um yeah, that's it for now.\nuser interface: That's it.\nproject manager: Any other questions\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: or can we have the lunch?\nindustrial designer: We can have the lunch.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I'll take the lunch.\nproject manager: Good.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "This is the second meeting of the design group. Project Manager introduced new project requirements at first. The management required a remote control only for television and aimed at customers under 40. In terms of user interface design, User Interface focused on user-friendliness but still thought multi-function should be considered. Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to substitute voice recognition for the ten digits. He also suggested that they should use infrared so that the remote control could be connected with most TV sets. After that, in order to solve the problem of energy source, the team decided to include a cradle so that the remote control could be recharged.", "zh_summary": "这是设计团队的第二次会议。项目经理一开始就介绍了新的项目要求。管理层要求遥控器只能用于电视，并针对40岁以下的客户。在用户界面设计方面，用户界面部侧重于用户友好性，但仍然认为应该考虑多功能性。产品设计部同意并建议用语音识别来代替遥控器上的十个数字按钮。产品设计部还建议应该使用红外线，这样遥控器就可以连接大多数的电视。之后，为了解决能源的问题，团队决定设计一个充电底座，方便遥控器充电。", "fr_summary": "Il s'agissait de la deuxième réunion du groupe de conception.

{"fname": "product_test_105", "dialogue": "user interface: Yeah, I'll start.\nproject manager: Uh uh yeah. Okay,\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: great.\nuser interface: Um Oh, how can I uh Geez, and sli and show. Um Just uh press it.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh yes. Alright. Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion. Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set. So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls, the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities, but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um but um yeah. My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control, because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design. But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design. But it should b I think it should be a combination, but teletext buttons are not uh in our design. So it should uh take out, well, eight buttons or so. But my in my opinion, the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us.\nproject manager: Okay. Uh Ruud, did you get that?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, uh b uh most.\nproject manager: Okay, so\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: the important thing here is \nuser interface: And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic.\nmarketing: Oh, user-friendly.\nproject manager: In the market, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, what what does the market want? I I don't know.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay, w we will s we all uh \nuser interface: Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay. Sebastian.\nuser interface: And just about uh the user interface, I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: What should we choose in in design?\nproject manager: Yeah. Well, um according to Ruud, um people do not use um all the extra features very very often.\nuser interface: Well, the extra functions.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Well, t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function.\nuser interface: Used option.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, we we do have a wise board, so I'm not questioning that. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well yeah, channel selection is obviously the most important.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection, the volume selection and the teletext.\nmarketing: So Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Well, we skip that.\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Well, so it just th the basic functions. And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff.\nindustrial designer: No, no.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: So {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nope.\nindustrial designer: So that's out of the question.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Just through uh the easy uh design. We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it.\nindustrial designer: So \nproject manager: Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one.\nindustrial designer: I think also. Yes. Well,\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: So \nindustrial designer: we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay,\nindustrial designer: and \nproject manager: Ruud, how do you feel about that? Uh do you agree, do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple \nmarketing: Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: 'cause young people uh like new features.\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's right.\nproject manager: Okay, so this is is kind of uh \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Uh just a few buttons, trendy design, nice lightning effects wh and the sound.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Well, is it maybe there's another possibility. You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment, but it's quite elaborated, uh because it has many functions.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly, easy to catch piece of equipment, but um nevertheless \nproject manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons, no display, um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ok like that. Well, I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling, by by these kinds of sticks or something like that. I don't know if if it's user-friendly. That's your field of expertise.\nproject manager: But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is?\nuser interface: Yeah, I don't know yet. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Because we do not implement uh a user history.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. There's no, but there's no way to do that, because we cannot implement that kind of the system.\nproject manager: I know, but but if we use uh like a stick, for example, um \nindustrial designer: W Mm-hmm. Well, maybe we can use a light for that. When you move the stick to a to a position, maybe uh a light next to it can lit up. So you know I've just uh pushed the button, or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume. Something like that.\nmarketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection, you have the m two most important functions in one uh button.\nproject manager: Yeah. Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick, uh like many cell phones, just a round m well,\nproject manager: Yeah, draw draw it on the board.\nuser interface: should we just use a Um it's already uh oh, we have a blank. Oh.\nindustrial designer: yeah, something like that. Oh\nuser interface: It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions. Instead of a stick.\nindustrial designer: It's not really a stick, but Yes. Yes.\nuser interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down\nproject manager: Yeah, it can break down.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: or uh\nindustrial designer: Yes, yes.\nuser interface: just a round uh button should be the trick, I think.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And Yes, and this also looks more fancy, I think.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public, I think.\nmarketing: A younger uh Huh.\nindustrial designer: But you're the marketing man.\nmarketing: And it's also quite easy to use, so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new, and it might attract older people because it's easy to use.\nuser interface: Geez. Well, volume and something uh like that. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-huh. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The programme up and down. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, yeah.\nuser interface: And the vol yeah, the pen doesn't uh really does what I want.\nindustrial designer: Okay, that's good.\nproject manager: Okay, but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options. Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques. Um however, uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things. We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: But I think our our next step to look at is just that. So I don't think it's um we have something to do. Uh we can't discuss it right now, because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that, I think.\nproject manager: Um well, for we do have to uh decide this this meeting. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yes?\nproject manager: We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: but teletext is so uh is just scrapped. 'Kay,\nindustrial designer: Okay. Do do you want a list of functions? Do you want an explicit list? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device?\nproject manager: Um well, I do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list, but I want um the kind of functions, for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: The ten digits.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Well, for example, that that's what we should think about. l how is the remote going to look? Not not in the user interface, but \nuser interface: Oh, and just one function. The the the the programme to programme button, the switch to uh two channels, when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six, just one button which which can uh change\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yes.\nproject manager: Yeah. A bit of a split mode.\nindustrial designer: Change.\nproject manager: Uh l like Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes, yes.\nproject manager: Dual channel watch.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: Okay, well um\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: m maybe I should write that down. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: you're the secretary. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh Ruud, um what's your last name?\nmarketing: Mielsen.\nproject manager: Mielsen, because I I was writing it down in the last uh Mielsen. Right. Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder. So if you want to have a look at it, you know where to find it. Um \nindustrial designer: Mm okay,\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it, because it's starting to fill up already. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, that's that's \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: if you want to do it, Sebastian. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh \nindustrial designer: Sure. . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, um Okay, so so um uh \nuser interface: \nproject manager: Volume. Programme. Uh dual channel. Uh \nindustrial designer: Yes, that's important.\nproject manager: And and do we want um the ten digits?\nuser interface: The ten digits? Yeah, I believe so.\nindustrial designer: Well, are are you sure?\nmarketing: Well, if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button.\nindustrial designer: I'm not so sure.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well, that's complicated,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but is that so relevant? Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that. If it were so.\nuser interface: I wouldn't buy it personally. A remote control without the ten digits.\nindustrial designer: Okay,\nuser interface: Uh and I think the most \nindustrial designer: I can imagine when\nproject manager: I agree actually. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it,\nindustrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have, well, about six hundred channels, I can imagine you want this.\nmarketing: Well \nuser interface: but \nindustrial designer: But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user, and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks, well, you can uh  you can use uh about ten buttons. That's enough.\nproject manager: But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels.\nmarketing: But \nuser interface: Yep. The older people only use five of them.\nindustrial designer: Well,\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels?\nmarketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience, they will probably watch more channels than the older people.\nproject manager: Often.\nindustrial designer: No, you're probably right.\nmarketing: So \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay. But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull. Don't you think?\nproject manager: Well, it depends on the on the on the looks, on the on the \nindustrial designer: The design.\nuser interface: On the design.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Well, y then there should be should done be done something specific with it.\nmarketing: Well \nproject manager: You c you can d make them very fancy\nmarketing: And \nproject manager: by um I mean Nokia, they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So I'm I'm I do not agree \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour, that kind of thing.\nproject manager: Exactly, exactly.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it. Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement, but it would be a solution uh for \nproject manager: Okay, speech.\nindustrial designer: Well, maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control, uh it's very easy to change uh the channel. That's one thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And it's very easy uh to find your remote control.\nproject manager: To find yeah.\nindustrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility, but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh If if we would um drop the ten digits\nindustrial designer: But maybe when we uh \nproject manager: but keep the programme and the volume,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because maybe people do not always want to use their voice, um \nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay, okay.\nmarketing: Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition. So then we should implement such a but\nproject manager: Yeah. But we do focus on younger people. We d it it's a board uh decision.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Well. I I think it should uh should work, it sh we should manage that.\nuser interface: So\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Well, the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage. It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So that's that's a big advantage, I think.\nproject manager: Okay, g good.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this.

Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set.

{"fname": "product_test_108", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Okay. Excuse me. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Scusi. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um Okay, it's still the right thing. Okay. Um well, there are some changes in the design requirements, so there are some changes in the method also.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set. And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set. Well, I th I tried to uh implement a picture here,\nuser interface: Energies and uh \nindustrial designer: but it's hardly readable. Can you see it?\nproject manager: No, it's not visible.\nindustrial designer: No? Well Um, there's a energy source here. And um basically there it's connected to three things. The user interface connected to a chip, which is connected to the sender, which generates messages using uh infrared light, which are sent to the receiver. That's basically the idea. And there's a little picture, just for your imagination, how a device like this should look or can look. Okay. Um what have I found. Usually these kind of things consist of a battery, infrared diode, buttons, chips, and circuit board. That's all. It's cased together, nothing more than that. It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There are some exceptions, but most of all have uh infrared controls. And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons. And I think that's what we w\nuser interface: The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed.\nindustrial designer: yes. In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also. So maybe we should consider that. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay. I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented. Um basically this is all there is. There's just one chip. There are a few buttons connected. Uh the buttons are lit. And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode, and there is not a power source here. So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment.\nproject manager: So it's fairly easy.\nindustrial designer: There's nothing more to it. It's fairly easy. It's been done many times before,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Succeed in it also.\nindustrial designer: and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay,\nindustrial designer: So Okay, so uh\nproject manager: good.\nindustrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared, because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set. So I think that uh should be clear.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse, friendly components. Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components. And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design, we should really implement them. Um for cost-effectiveness, we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board, um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques, blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff.\nuser interface: And what's the um \nindustrial designer: I think our uh users will really uh will really like that.\nuser interface: if we use the LEDs, i does it use much more energy or \nindustrial designer: No, they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So we can use them. So that's no problem.\nuser interface: For the same costs, it's can be uh in our \nindustrial designer: Uh no, they're uh they're a little bit more expensive, but by uh um um making \nuser interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh \nindustrial designer: We can we can make its I think.\nmarketing: Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most. So, the channel switching.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques, I guess.\nmarketing: Or \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: But I think \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's the same as in the cell phone, just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons,\nmarketing: Hmm, true. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and not for \nindustrial designer: Yes. Well, it's not one light, it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device.\nuser interface: Yeah, but not for each button one LED, I think.\nindustrial designer: No no no, no. That's right, that's right.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So well, this uh should be it.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um have a think about it.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, Ruud.\nmarketing: Oh, mine is already outdated.\nproject manager: Okay well,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product.\nmarketing: Since uh \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So any income is welcome. Input.\nmarketing: Okay, make Well Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units. Of  of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Could you step a little bit more to the right? Yeah, thank you. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market, I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market. But uh since uh the requirements changed, that's uh not a good idea.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh well, skip this. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, it's this till true, of course. That they only use ten percent the buttons. The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times, when uh the power button is only used one time. And the volume button's only four times. So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons. And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them. Some uh audio signal. Like uh home phones.\nproject manager: Okay. Well, that's interesting.\nmarketing: Or \nindustrial designer: Or a find a finding function,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: you know.\nproject manager: that's definitely interesting.\nindustrial designer: That's quite a yes.\nproject manager: It uh it separates our product from others uh as well.\nuser interface: Sound signal.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: go on.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: Well, I just said that. And uh well, this obvious, and he also said it.\nproject manager: Okay. So that's what the market tells us.\nmarketing: Uh that's about it, yes.\nproject manager: Yep. Okay.\nuser interface: The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used.\nmarketing: Uh mo uh zap buttons most.\nuser interface: So \nmarketing: Volume, they are uh use a lot. But more than all the other buttons. So \nuser interface: Yeah, well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons. And first um \nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes, we should focus on that, I guess.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Well, the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties. There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment. So um I don't think we have any hiccups there. So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs. So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal.\nuser interface: Yeah, the sound signal. Just one thing I'm just wondering, the sound signal, from where do you execute th the s sound?\nindustrial designer: Well\nmarketing: Yeah, that's uh a problem. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yes. Th that's a bit of that's a problem.\nuser interface: Another device is not a solution.\nproject manager: Well\nindustrial designer: Usually \nproject manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands,\nuser interface: It should be uh uh \nproject manager: like um turning on and off the the the lights.\nindustrial designer: Oh yes.\nuser interface: Yeah, but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Well, there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already. Um there are video sets and um they have a special button, the find the remote control button. You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound, and your uh remote controls then start to beep.\nproject manager: Reports rep respend response to it.\nindustrial designer: And um \nuser interface: just like uh the phones Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes, that's it. Yes, same thing.\nuser interface: the \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But uh th\nuser interface: But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons. Uh \nindustrial designer: No, so we we should use something else.\nmarketing: And you \nproject manager: Yeah, because we do not have a a a a a home um \nuser interface: But I believe you will have an \nmarketing: Yeah, and usually \nindustrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well.\nmarketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button, uh you would have to walk to your T_V_,\nindustrial designer: Yes, m yes. S and we b we want to make so it's  is easy as possible for our customers,\nmarketing: and it's \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: so we should think about \nproject manager: So what about the clapping technique? Um because you se\nuser interface: I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us.\nindustrial designer: It's quite complicated. Well, it's quite complicated. Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds.\nmarketing: And b\nproject manager: Well, you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh \nindustrial designer: Yes, yes. Well, basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume, the amplitude of the sound,\nproject manager: Yeah, a peak. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control.\nmarketing: So if if you'd be watching a movie, it would constantly beep.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's true.\nindustrial designer: Yes,\nuser interface: But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_. Just a little antenna or uh something.\nindustrial designer: so we don't want that.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe we can Something like that.\nuser interface: Well if you lost th\nindustrial designer: Well,\nproject manager: Well uh \nindustrial designer: is there not something f something more easily \nuser interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote.\nindustrial designer: Well, I don't think uh .\nuser interface: Uh that's just uh \nindustrial designer: No, and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so w we should use have uh we should use something like that. You do not want another device, which can be uh everywhere in the house, which you have to find first before you can find your remote control.\nuser interface: just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility.\nindustrial designer: Yes, something like that. But that will be very costly, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function, if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things.\nindustrial designer: So that's not a good idea.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. I will.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: because that's his his field of expertise.\nindustrial designer: Yes. Yes. But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: um and it will become more costly also.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used. And there are some implepe imp\nuser interface: And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs, the lightning uh function?\nindustrial designer: Well, I I think so, because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control, you cannot see it.\nuser interface: It's a unique item uh \nproject manager: Yeah, it's a distinction in the market.\nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: It will be an a unique feature of our remote control.\nproject manager: It's a different exactly.

Yes. So No, that's very cheap.\nmarketing: 'Cause when \nproject manager: Is a cradle very cheap?\nindustrial designer: It's Oh, it's very cheap. That's no problem. It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts.\nproject manager: I know, b uh but there should be an adapter as well.\nindustrial designer: It's Yes, but they're they're mass production.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: They're very cheap.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So it will cost us p practically nothing.", "en_query": "What did the group discuss about technical issues of the project?", "zh_query": "关于项目的技术问题，开发团队进行了什么讨论？", "fr_query": "Qu’a dit le groupe concernant les problèmes techniques du projet ?", "ukr_query": "Які технічні питання проекту обговорила група?", "en_summary": "Industrial Designer introduced how the remote control worked and supposed that they should use infrared so that the remote control could communicate with most TV sets.

Um\nuser interface: 'Kay. You able to look?\nindustrial designer: It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour, either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something.\nuser interface: Yep. \nindustrial designer: This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached, but we can we can come up with that.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns, so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it. Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design {vocalsound}\nuser interface: .\nindustrial designer: and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say, it's yeah yeah, it would be sort of inset into the into the top\nuser interface: The black and white touch screen wherein people can \nproject manager: Mm. So it's flush.\nindustrial designer: and the buttons at the bottom would d\nuser interface: Right.\nindustrial designer: so so it'll fully close flat.\nproject manager: Oh right, okay, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, so that you could probably get a bit of \nproject manager: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: 'cause it's the top part that's okay.\nindustrial designer: Um we decided that um the voice recognition system, it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where where is the remote and it'll shout back, I'm here, or something.\nmarketing: Or something. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And then yeah. It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something. It'll just shout out I'm here, or something to similar effect.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: I'm under the sofa.\nuser interface: Ah oka\nproject manager: Or, that would be too complicated.\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah, if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time, maybe. You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is. Um the standard, there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about.\nproject manager: Infrared .\nindustrial designer: Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers, it would need two separate P_C_B_s, so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And uh because, obviously, all T_V_s use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data. And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer, just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on.\nproject manager: Like here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, something like that.\nuser interface: Infrared could be here also. Yeah, here.\nproject manager: Okay. Actually, no, it would be it would have to be on the on the front.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, on the front on the front side of that, yeah.\nuser interface: . So when it's even if it's open here, the signals would go .\nproject manager: Oh right, yeah, okay, yeah, I've got you. It's still pointing,\nindustrial designer: So when you've actually got it open, it would be facing the T_V_.\nproject manager: yes.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, that would make sense.\nindustrial designer: And then finally um on to the interface. The top screen, as we said, is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen\nuser interface: This one right here.\nindustrial designer: which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it, uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the vo volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off, and uh things to that effect.\nuser interface: .\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.\nuser interface: Which is \nproject manager: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product\nindustrial designer: No d not not actually. No, not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: once it's \nuser interface: Look up to it.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics,\nproject manager: Thank you very much.\nindustrial designer: as that is that's the company logo .\nuser interface: Yay.\nproject manager: Wrapping it all up, okay.\nmarketing: Well done.\nproject manager: Um I've now got evaluation criteria.\nmarketing: Certainly.\nuser interface: So this is the one. Sorry.\nproject manager: It's to be presented .\nindustrial designer: There you go. .\nmarketing: Logged in? Thank you. Oops.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Evaluation. .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm um I I think this is chip.\nproject manager: It's quite similar to what it was before, though.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Sorry.\nmarketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. So this is the first stage of the evaluation. Now, the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now the findings that we came up with, just a recap, are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, but there was also, on the sideline, the though of maybe having a beeper function. Okay, so we can come back to that slide, if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll call that slide back up,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Does that seem clear? Any questions there?\nuser interface: Ah, it's perfect.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we're going to look at these crite So\nuser interface: Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market \nmarketing: Yes,\nuser interface: okay.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Is that okay?\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nmarketing: One is true, seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A_, B_, C_, D_, E_, F_ to confuse it with the number rating. B_, C_, D_, E_, F_. This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just write small.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Criteria and rating. Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. How about that?\nuser interface: Yeah, so you can \nproject manager: Yeah. That works.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel. One is true, seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false.\nproject manager: I would agree.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah,\nmarketing: I'll just go this way.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: two or three.\nmarketing: Two.\nindustrial designer: No, three. Three.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: I would say two.\nmarketing: Two.\nuser interface: I would say four.\nmarketing: A four, okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Adding those up, we've got a six and a five, eleven divided by four is what? Uh two and three quarters, it that right.\nuser interface: Almost three.\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: Two and three quarters?\nuser interface: I think yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Two point seven five, there we go. Okay, criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three.\nindustrial designer: I'd give it a one.\nmarketing: Okay. Not that you're biased in that it the designer.\nindustrial designer: No, no, not at all.\nproject manager: A two.\nuser interface: Oh sorry, I I got it wrong. The first one rating, I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The first.\nmarketing: The average \nuser interface: Yeah, I I just it the other way.\nmarketing: oh, for you? You want your rating to be a two? Is that what you're saying?\nuser interface: Uh in Yep, I just got \nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: \nmarketing: So, I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered Okay,\nuser interface: two point f\nmarketing: and we're just waiting for your rating\nproject manager: It's just two point five for that one.\nmarketing: f\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Two point five, okay. Losing one decimal place, that's okay.\nuser interface: One is a , seven is false, okay.\nmarketing: So what are you rating for this one, Paw?\nuser interface: Two.\nmarketing: Two, okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two,\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: nice and simple, yeah. Okay, ease of use. Easy to use? Based on what you've said there, I would say a one, true.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: Two.\nproject manager: I would say a two. I would say a two.\nmarketing: A two, okay.\nuser interface: Two.\nmarketing: Two. I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy, shouldn't I?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We'll just put almost two,\nproject manager: One point seven f five.\nmarketing: because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places.\nproject manager: Okay, mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Or we or if we want to really bring it down, we can do later. Um mm now we're looking at\nindustrial designer: D_.\nmarketing: it incorporates current fashion trends, now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours.\nindustrial designer: One. Yeah.\nmarketing: Right. So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's \nmarketing: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use?\nindustrial designer: No, no, the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue,\nuser interface: White. With for the plastic? Uh blue.\nindustrial designer: but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Any \nmarketing: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do.\nuser interface: Right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and \nmarketing: And the spongy feel is no problem with that.\nuser interface: Yeah, because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case.\nindustrial designer: No, no, 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it, that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic.\nmarketing: Okay. In that case it's got to be a one for me.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I'll give it a one as well.\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: One.\nmarketing: Everybody? Okay.\nuser interface: One.\nmarketing: That part was nice and easy.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay. Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: I don't think we've really touched on that a lot.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: We've we've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half, the material, minimises R_S_I_\nindustrial designer: It's meant to be.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: it's meant to. Um\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: maybe because it's slightl\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: with the size that we've got it's quite small,\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Right.\nproject manager: It's quite obvious just big buttons. Um \nmarketing: Right. I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five, actually,\nmarketing: A five, okay.\nindustrial designer: 'cause \nproject manager: Four.\nmarketing: Four and a four okay.\nuser interface: Four.\nmarketing: Twenty one is that twenty one?\nuser interface: \nmarketing: So that's four point two five.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. Now we talked about voice recognition, we talked about a beeper, have we really \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: have the designers come to any dec real decision on that?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition,\nuser interface: Voice r recognition.\nmarketing: It was the I'm here thing,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: yep. And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible.\nmarketing: That sounds good then. I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that, just as we could volume on T_V_. So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms, or.\nindustrial designer: Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand\nproject manager: A standard.\nindustrial designer: it would be quite loud.\nproject manager: It would be.\nmarketing: Right. Okay.\nindustrial designer: So it would be s p\nmarketing: You built into the feature.\nproject manager: And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room, you'd go into another room.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Logical. That's a one for me.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, one.\nmarketing: One\nproject manager: One.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and one, good.\nindustrial designer: I do realise that we might be being fairly biased, 'cause it is our product,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but \nmarketing: how do we feel about this?\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got, which is really n it's not terribly low, i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications?\nproject manager: I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: W I thin yeah, I think \nmarketing: We happy to go ahead?\nproject manager: I think we yeah. I think we're set.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.\nproject manager: Do much apart from having a huge big \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: I know. Okay. Well, I hope that's uh clear to the team. Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up?\nproject manager: Don't think so.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Good. Fine then. I'll just leave it there.\nproject manager: Okay, thank you.\nmarketing: Oops.\nproject manager: Okay,\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: I've got finance here now. I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it, if that's okay. Um.\nmarketing: Oh yes.\nuser interface: You want me to b unplug that?\nindustrial designer: \nuser interface: That's all. Yes.\nproject manager: Thanks. Right.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Now I presume that the screen will go blank,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: that um Okay. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So are we still on for kinetic?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: Okay. See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. Um it might have influenced our choice. Right, what's happening with the electronics?\nindustrial designer: It was a regular chip on print\nuser interface: Chip on print.\nindustrial designer: and \nproject manager: Double-curved.\nindustrial designer: Oh, no, no, no, the um Yeah, it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells, there should just be one. In the top, it's the number\nproject manager: Oh, right,\nindustrial designer: of c yeah .\nproject manager: okay. Thanks.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: So, would there be two?\nindustrial designer: and yeah, just a no, one reg v uh \nproject manager: One chip.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yep.\nindustrial designer: And they're double curved. No.\nuser interface: Single-curved.\nproject manager: One double curve.\nindustrial designer: Y Two,\nuser interface: Two curves, yeah.\nindustrial designer: 'cause it's two.\nmarketing: But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit. So it can rest.\nproject manager: So what's a single curve then?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I'd say I'd say it was w\nmarketing: It would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing.\nindustrial designer: yeah, I think I think it's \nuser interface: Single-cu\nproject manager: So just one double \nindustrial designer: One double-curved.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah. Um \nuser interface: .\nindustrial designer: And one \nuser interface: Plastic and rubber.\nindustrial designer: no, 'cause one yeah, one's double-curved, and then the other one's\nmarketing: The other curves at the sides, but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm. Um we've got plastic and rubber,\nindustrial designer: a plastic.\nproject manager: haven't we?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Plastic one and maybe rubber point five.\nindustrial designer: And special colour.\nproject manager: .\nuser interface: No I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing,\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: we can put point five.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Do you think?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it allows the point five, yeah. We can use that.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: What does it mean if you put point five for that?\nuser interface: It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually. We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic.\nproject manager: It would be like saying we're using See, it says case material. So\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: we're not actually using plastic in the case, are we?\nindustrial designer: No, no, that's it's as an extra.\nproject manager: It's including, it's including.\nmarketing: Right, okay.\nindustrial designer: So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get.\nmarketing: But it is gonna be part of the total cost, and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in, is there?\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there?\nproject manager: Okay, we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: No, we don't step on anyone's toes. Okay, special colour, do we need that?\nmarketing: Might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours.\nproject manager: N yeah, okay. Interface.\nuser interface: Push-button.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: the push-button's one and L_C_ display one.\nuser interface: An One.\nproject manager: Buttons \nindustrial designer: And buttons \nmarketing: S\nuser interface: I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery.\nmarketing: Has that not made any d if you click off that square now, has that not made any difference?\nproject manager: Has that not gone up?\nindustrial designer: Well yes.\nmarketing: Is it oh, it's brought it slightly down.\nproject manager: Oh no, it was seven five it's changed not a lot.\nmarketing: So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: is that going to make a difference?\nuser interface: Uncurved, flat.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh, it's not made any difference, has it?.\nuser interface: No,\nindustrial designer: No,\nuser interface: it just surprises one.\nindustrial designer: we'll have \nmarketing: It's gone up again.\nproject manager: Oh, it's not calculated it.\nindustrial designer: No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again.\nmarketing: Oh.\nproject manager: Okay, there we go.\nmarketing: It's brought it down slightly.\nproject manager: It's not a lot though.\nuser interface: . I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros. It could be in Dollars. And then it would be fine, because the exchange range would make it about twelve.\nproject manager: We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though,\nmarketing: Is there anything on the menu \nproject manager: I think \nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: Ri I think it's in Euro .\nproject manager: Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here. Um and the interface.\nmarketing: If we tr um. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference?\nuser interface: And going to a regular bat Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, the standard, it um it would make one difference. The biggest one would be taking away if you took away \nuser interface: What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery .\nindustrial designer: If you to\nuser interface: It's internal, nobody looks into the battery.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: But shape and colours, that's something we shouldn't comprimi\nmarketing: And people are used to buying batteries,\nindustrial designer: If if you take away the voice,\nmarketing: they're not gonna say I'm not getting this, 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control.\nindustrial designer: I I do I don't like to say it, but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it.\nuser interface: Where's that special form? Mm mm mm.\nmarketing: Should we see what difference it makes?\nproject manager: Where's the\nindustrial designer: Yeah i yeah.\nproject manager: where's the voice recognition?\nindustrial designer: No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker.\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: Right, okay.\nindustrial designer: If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five.\nproject manager: Well the kinetic is three. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three.\nindustrial designer: They n n yeah, but you p minus three plus two.\nproject manager: Oh, right. I keep seeing zero. Um We can do it some other way,\nuser interface: \nproject manager: we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition. We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: You could choose to have that or not.\nmarketing: Sure.\nindustrial designer: But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product.\nmarketing: But we're still working to um head o\nproject manager: So should we just change the design specification then? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Make it costly.\nmarketing: We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: We c we could s\nmarketing: But we need to work to that specification to start with.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we could say \nmarketing: And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance. Um as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers\nproject manager: Okay, we can make the price fit,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I s\nproject manager: and then say if we'd had our budget, we would've had this,\nindustrial designer: And then say we recommend \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: because it also sets it apart from the crowd.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it.\nproject manager: They like their gadgets, they like something that's completely different.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's s something completely different associated with your company.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Right, okay, so \nmarketing: So if we take voice recognition out \nindustrial designer: That'll do it. Twelve point three five.\nuser interface: Yeah we are close to the budget.\nmarketing: we are.\nindustrial designer: Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty?\nuser interface: Two five.\nproject manager: It's two point five. No, it's twelve point two five.\nmarketing: Are you sure? Sorry, not meaning to doubt your words there.\nproject manager: Yeah well two, twelve point two five times two is twenty five,\nmarketing: Right. Are they really going to quibble about ten P_? Or point zero one of a Euro?\nuser interface: It's twelve point five maybe, then.\nproject manager: isn't it?\nmarketing: Which is less than ten P_.\nuser interface: I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost. So half of the price would be \nproject manager: I think the agenda one was where the um price was, wasn't it? No.\nuser interface: I think it is the first one.\nmarketing: That's today's kick off meeting, .\nproject manager: Twelve point five.\nmarketing: Mm. I thought that's what it was.\nuser interface: So we are under the budget.\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: Ah.\nproject manager: Well done, people.\nmarketing: So we're okay.\nproject manager: So\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: is that uh got us covered for the electronics then? We don't need something else to take that place?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. No.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra, you could just take that out and that would be fine, yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Seems fine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think that's brilliant.\nuser interface: Except voice recognition, everything is \nproject manager: Right, so we've done that. Okay. Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity, haven't we?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. Um\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yes. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: um in the sense that um did you feel like a team? Or did you feel like uh autonomy?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I'd say, as a team.\nuser interface: I think we had a nice time.\nmarketing: Although we had our separate tasks,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to um bounce off each other.\nindustrial designer: Find out from each other, yeah.\nmarketing: And I've certainly felt heard, listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take and adjust our remit where necessary.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. It's not like people trying to cut each other. There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork. We came to a very predic creative design, yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, and uh Yeah, I think. And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well.\nproject manager: Thank you. How did you find it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, no, I thought it it went really well and I yeah, I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out, although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's that's good.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would've come out a d little different,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but yeah.\nproject manager: I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like shot down,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: you know, y it didn't matter it saying what you thought, because if it wasn't something that was that relevant, then it didn't matter, 'cause it was just another idea in the field. I like that. Um\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: teamwork. Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, well.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think that was the best part\nproject manager: Um uh I'm still not caught up.\nuser interface: of the {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all. Um \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line. And fake R_C_s.\nproject manager: Maybe.\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: No, that was quite fun. Um means, whiteboard, digital pens, etcetera, what does that mean? Any ideas?\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Discuss which ones \nmarketing: How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information?\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Could it've been better, was it adequate?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more, had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more.\nproject manager: Had time to kind of \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah, 'cause we could just sort of say, sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that, rather than having to email it,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But it was nice having it there. Um like the whole picture of the thing.\nuser interface: Yeah, moving around the room. But I think it's good,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: like uh we spent times individually. I never thought of a remote control with a flip top. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, I think it's new ideas in general,\nmarketing: It's really borrowing from other areas, it's, you know, bringing things from other areas in,\nproject manager: rather than \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: it so it's I mean nothing is new,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: but it's applying it to a d in a different area.\nindustrial designer: Vegetables.\nuser interface: That's mine.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, no. Well\nuser interface: Yeah, it's {vocalsound}\nproject manager: they have to come from somewhere, don't they?\nmarketing: Absolutely, yeah.\nuser interface: The thing is \nproject manager: And as sh as w sorry,\nuser interface: Yep, sorry,\nproject manager: you go.\nuser interface: go on Sarah.\nproject manager: Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it particularly.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: I mean they're slightly different, so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's, 'cause it's w something we should think about,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned. They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player, does anyone remember the remote control? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one? Yeah, just jazz it up a bit.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Uh d they don't really think about it,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because normally, the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship. They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player, the video player, the T_V_.\nmarketing: Yeah, the focus isn't on to that, yeah.\nproject manager: But then when it everything is really smart, and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table, it doesn't go,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing, a funky item that's individual, individual to you,\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic, you would pray \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: you would pay a lot extra, because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: But people could have anything that they wanted.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones, like a real want to see a new launch or something like that.\nproject manager: Because of the produ Mm.\nuser interface: And new f television products coming up,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: but nobody giving uh much idea to this. Like Sarah was telling, everything's \nmarketing: I think it's really good that this has been very market research based,\nuser interface: Right.\nmarketing: because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is is obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot, and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with, and they can't get it anymore\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and it's innovation for innovation's sake, and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Well, it's innovation for money's sake.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: The the people have to keep buying.\nmarketing: But forcing it onto people,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: yeah. It's things that, you know, they might want to buy the thing they really want.\nproject manager: And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine, but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone,\nmarketing: Mm. Mm.\nproject manager: because the phones have moved on, things like that.\nmarketing: Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever,\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: It's madness. Um \nmarketing: See I think \nproject manager: In closing There we go.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, but I think I don't know, d what do you think?

{"fname": "product_test_112", "dialogue": "marketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. So this is the first stage of the evaluation. Now, the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting, are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now the findings that we came up with, just a recap, are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, and those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, but there was also, on the sideline, the though of maybe having a beeper function. Okay, so we can come back to that slide, if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale, where one is true and seven is false. We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll call that slide back up,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Does that seem clear? Any questions there?\nuser interface: Ah, it's perfect.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we're going to look at these crite So\nuser interface: Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market \nmarketing: Yes,\nuser interface: okay.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Is that okay?\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nmarketing: One is true, seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A_, B_, C_, D_, E_, F_ to confuse it with the number rating. B_, C_, D_, E_, F_. This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just write small.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Criteria and rating. Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, and we could take an average at the end. How about that?\nuser interface: Yeah, so you can \nproject manager: Yeah. That works.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques, and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's who.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Criteria A_, the fancy look and feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel. One is true, seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false.\nproject manager: I would agree.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah,\nmarketing: I'll just go this way.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: two or three.\nmarketing: Two.\nindustrial designer: No, three. Three.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: I would say two.\nmarketing: Two.\nuser interface: I would say four.\nmarketing: A four, okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Adding those up, we've got a six and a five, eleven divided by four is what? Uh two and three quarters, it that right.\nuser interface: Almost three.\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: Two and three quarters?\nuser interface: I think yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Two point seven five, there we go. Okay, criteria B_, criterion B_, technologically innovative. I would give that a three.\nindustrial designer: I'd give it a one.\nmarketing: Okay. Not that you're biased in that it the designer.\nindustrial designer: No, no, not at all.\nproject manager: A two.\nuser interface: Oh sorry, I I got it wrong. The first one rating, I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The first.\nmarketing: The average \nuser interface: Yeah, I I just it the other way.\nmarketing: oh, for you? You want your rating to be a two? Is that what you're saying?\nuser interface: Uh in Yep, I just got \nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: \nmarketing: So, I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered Okay,\nuser interface: two point f\nmarketing: and we're just waiting for your rating\nproject manager: It's just two point five for that one.\nmarketing: f\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Two point five, okay. Losing one decimal place, that's okay.\nuser interface: One is a , seven is false, okay.\nmarketing: So what are you rating for this one, Paw?\nuser interface: Two.\nmarketing: Two, okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two,\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: nice and simple, yeah. Okay, ease of use. Easy to use? Based on what you've said there, I would say a one, true.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: Two.\nproject manager: I would say a two. I would say a two.\nmarketing: A two, okay.\nuser interface: Two.\nmarketing: Two. I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy, shouldn't I?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We'll just put almost two,\nproject manager: One point seven f five.\nmarketing: because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places.\nproject manager: Okay, mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Or we or if we want to really bring it down, we can do later. Um mm now we're looking at\nindustrial designer: D_.\nmarketing: it incorporates current fashion trends, now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours.\nindustrial designer: One. Yeah.\nmarketing: Right. So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's \nmarketing: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use?\nindustrial designer: No, no, the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue,\nuser interface: White. With for the plastic? Uh blue.\nindustrial designer: but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Any \nmarketing: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do.\nuser interface: Right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and \nmarketing: And the spongy feel is no problem with that.\nuser interface: Yeah, because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case.\nindustrial designer: No, no, 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it, that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic.\nmarketing: Okay. In that case it's got to be a one for me.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I'll give it a one as well.\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: One.\nmarketing: Everybody? Okay.\nuser interface: One.\nmarketing: That part was nice and easy.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay. Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: I don't think we've really touched on that a lot.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: We've we've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half, the material, minimises R_S_I_\nindustrial designer: It's meant to be.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: it's meant to. Um\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: maybe because it's slightl\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: with the size that we've got it's quite small,\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So maybe because there's more space, it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Right.\nproject manager: It's quite obvious just big buttons. Um \nmarketing: Right. I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five, actually,\nmarketing: A five, okay.\nindustrial designer: 'cause \nproject manager: Four.\nmarketing: Four and a four okay.\nuser interface: Four.\nmarketing: Twenty one is that twenty one?\nuser interface: \nmarketing: So that's four point two five.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. Now we talked about voice recognition, we talked about a beeper, have we really \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: have the designers come to any dec real decision on that?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it was it was uh a voice voice recognition,\nuser interface: Voice r recognition.\nmarketing: It was the I'm here thing,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: yep. And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible, cost-wise.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, that yeah, that's feasible.\nmarketing: That sounds good then. I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that, just as we could volume on T_V_. So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms, or.\nindustrial designer: Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand\nproject manager: A standard.\nindustrial designer: it would be quite loud.\nproject manager: It would be.\nmarketing: Right. Okay.\nindustrial designer: So it would be s p\nmarketing: You built into the feature.\nproject manager: And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room, you'd go into another room.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Logical. That's a one for me.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, one.\nmarketing: One\nproject manager: One.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and one, good.\nindustrial designer: I do realise that we might be being fairly biased, 'cause it is our product,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but \nmarketing: how do we feel about this?\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got, which is really n it's not terribly low, i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modifications?\nproject manager: I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: W I thin yeah, I think \nmarketing: We happy to go ahead?\nproject manager: I think we yeah. I think we're set.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.\nproject manager: Do much apart from having a huge big \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: I know. Okay. Well, I hope that's uh clear to the team. Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up?\nproject manager: Don't think so.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Good. Fine then.

Um we've got plastic and rubber,\nindustrial designer: a plastic.\nproject manager: haven't we?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Plastic one and maybe rubber point five.\nindustrial designer: And special colour.\nproject manager: .\nuser interface: No I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing,\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: we can put point five.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Do you think?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it allows the point five, yeah. We can use that.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: What does it mean if you put point five for that?\nuser interface: It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually. We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic.\nproject manager: It would be like saying we're using See, it says case material. So\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: we're not actually using plastic in the case, are we?\nindustrial designer: No, no, that's it's as an extra.\nproject manager: It's including, it's including.\nmarketing: Right, okay.\nindustrial designer: So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get.\nmarketing: But it is gonna be part of the total cost, and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in, is there?\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there?\nproject manager: Okay, we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: No, we don't step on anyone's toes. Okay, special colour, do we need that?\nmarketing: Might do, if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours.\nproject manager: N yeah, okay. Interface.\nuser interface: Push-button.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: the push-button's one and L_C_ display one.\nuser interface: An One.\nproject manager: Buttons \nindustrial designer: And buttons \nmarketing: S\nuser interface: I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery.\nmarketing: Has that not made any d if you click off that square now, has that not made any difference?\nproject manager: Has that not gone up?\nindustrial designer: Well yes.\nmarketing: Is it oh, it's brought it slightly down.\nproject manager: Oh no, it was seven five it's changed not a lot.\nmarketing: So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: is that going to make a difference?\nuser interface: Uncurved, flat.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh, it's not made any difference, has it?.\nuser interface: No,\nindustrial designer: No,\nuser interface: it just surprises one.\nindustrial designer: we'll have \nmarketing: It's gone up again.\nproject manager: Oh, it's not calculated it.\nindustrial designer: No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again.\nmarketing: Oh.\nproject manager: Okay, there we go.\nmarketing: It's brought it down slightly.\nproject manager: It's not a lot though.\nuser interface: . I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros. It could be in Dollars. And then it would be fine, because the exchange range would make it about twelve.\nproject manager: We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though,\nmarketing: Is there anything on the menu \nproject manager: I think \nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: Ri I think it's in Euro .\nproject manager: Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here. Um and the interface.\nmarketing: If we tr um. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries, would that make a huge difference?\nuser interface: And going to a regular bat Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, the standard, it um it would make one difference. The biggest one would be taking away if you took away \nuser interface: What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery .\nindustrial designer: If you to\nuser interface: It's internal, nobody looks into the battery.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: But shape and colours, that's something we shouldn't comprimi\nmarketing: And people are used to buying batteries,\nindustrial designer: If if you take away the voice,\nmarketing: they're not gonna say I'm not getting this, 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control.\nindustrial designer: I I do I don't like to say it, but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it.\nuser interface: Where's that special form? Mm mm mm.\nmarketing: Should we see what difference it makes?\nproject manager: Where's the\nindustrial designer: Yeah i yeah.\nproject manager: where's the voice recognition?\nindustrial designer: No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker.\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: Right, okay.\nindustrial designer: If you took away that, that'll make it twelve point three five.\nproject manager: Well the kinetic is three. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three.\nindustrial designer: They n n yeah, but you p minus three plus two.\nproject manager: Oh, right. I keep seeing zero. Um We can do it some other way,\nuser interface: \nproject manager: we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition. We could do the voice recognition for, you know, business class or something, you know, like an upgraded version.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: You could choose to have that or not.\nmarketing: Sure.\nindustrial designer: But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now, because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product.\nmarketing: But we're still working to um head o\nproject manager: So should we just change the design specification then? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Make it costly.\nmarketing: We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: We c we could s\nmarketing: But we need to work to that specification to start with.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we could say \nmarketing: And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance. Um as you say, we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers\nproject manager: Okay, we can make the price fit,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I s\nproject manager: and then say if we'd had our budget, we would've had this,\nindustrial designer: And then say we recommend \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: because it also sets it apart from the crowd.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.

Twelve point three five.\nuser interface: Yeah we are close to the budget.\nmarketing: we are.\nindustrial designer: Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty?\nuser interface: Two five.\nproject manager: It's two point five. No, it's twelve point two five.\nmarketing: Are you sure? Sorry, not meaning to doubt your words there.\nproject manager: Yeah well two, twelve point two five times two is twenty five,\nmarketing: Right. Are they really going to quibble about ten P_? Or point zero one of a Euro?\nuser interface: It's twelve point five maybe, then.\nproject manager: isn't it?\nmarketing: Which is less than ten P_.\nuser interface: I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost. So half of the price would be \nproject manager: I think the agenda one was where the um price was, wasn't it? No.\nuser interface: I think it is the first one.\nmarketing: That's today's kick off meeting, .\nproject manager: Twelve point five.\nmarketing: Mm.

Yes, it's working.\nproject manager: So you all read what we are going to do or not?\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: We're gonna make a remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's right.\nindustrial designer: I think my laptop is a bit\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: etchy.\nproject manager: I just made a a simple uh presentation. So you put some things in it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. How does this work? I dunno. \nuser interface: One uh most to the right.\nindustrial designer: Uh p\nuser interface: Yes that one.\nproject manager: This one?\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Press F_ eleven.\nproject manager: Ah cool. Okay. So\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: that's my name, . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control, you already know that. Just have a look, are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting. You know, this is about twenty five minutes, this meeting. So um the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do, you also read what this the things or, not yet,\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: okay. So um, yeah, it has to be original, trendy, user-friendly that's what we're going to design. Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control. Fir the first thing is th the functional design, that's very important. We have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design, and and how the mm the the remote control works, so that's where we're going to look in the functional design, it's for the f next meeting. The the second thing is the conceptual design, that's what it that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface. And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market. And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah, you know what it is, it's exactly how it looks and whatever. Okay so uh no, this is a these are two smartboards, with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one. And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map.\nmarketing: Folder,\nproject manager: Folder, okay.\nmarketing: yes.\nproject manager: So no okay have a look at that one. Okay. So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read. You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and um and say why it's your favourite animal. So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen. So okay, so first have to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works. Yes?\nmarketing: Ah I can see it now.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: This a new page, it's okay. Use pen format. and a different colour can use here no I just take the pink. You take oh there's no pink, okay, oh just purple, okay.\nuser interface: Purple.\nproject manager: No blue. And uh line width ten. Okay uh just take what I'm going to draw is an elephant. Just draw slowly, because otherwise it won't work. It's a very nice elephant, you can see. I dunno what it looks but it doesn't matter. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Looks very nice.\nproject manager: I just h\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Something like this? Oh no \nmarketing: It look like a dinosaurs. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: A pink elephant.\nproject manager: Because I like uh okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just takes so long, okay. Whatever, just. You erased this one. It's a bit slow you can see, this is a bit annoying.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay, so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want. Just don't\nmarketing: Let me try one.\nproject manager: um yeah, just u use it like that, yeah. That's okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: Mm. Okay and then uh what's the colour? How do I do \nproject manager: It's in format. Yeah.\nmarketing: Ah. I'll take this one. Uh there has to be water,\nproject manager: Just \nmarketing: but {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No it has to be an animal, so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah, but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay okay. Okay.\nuser interface: The water is important. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: So I first uh draw the water.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh. Okay, and now I make the animal. It's a fish.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay,\nindustrial designer: Wow.\nproject manager: cool.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. So. Um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: This is a worm.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Hmm yeah, that's nice.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: Wow.\nmarketing: Okay, who next? Uh \nproject manager: Uh do you have to write down why uh that doesn't matter, just it's to get used to the whiteboard, but it's okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Just make a new blank new blank page.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Well Paul? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Like this?\nproject manager: Yeah, not too far to the to the t pen top.\nuser interface: Okay. Um\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: let's make it um a dog. Ooh.\nproject manager: Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back, so that no, to the yeah.\nuser interface: Ah okay.\nmarketing: I think it's a pig.\nuser interface: A pig?\nproject manager: No, it's a dog. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I can make \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Or a dog.\nuser interface: a dog.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: A sheep? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh we d only have twenty five minutes, so . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Take it easy.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: 'Kay, I make a cat of it.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I I was gonna make a cat too.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Use your fantasy. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh, not too quick.\nproject manager: Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have \nuser interface: No\nproject manager: okay.\nuser interface: I have it. I just draw too quick I think. Okay, that's it. More.\nproject manager: No, that's okay, thank you. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's just to get used to it.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word, you already did it or no? No, not yet, okay.\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's right,\nproject manager: But it's just \nuser interface: it but you actually got to write on the paper.\nproject manager: Sorry?\nuser interface: You really got to write on that paper.\nproject manager: Yeah, I know, but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word,\nmarketing: Yeah yeah, it's a real pen.\nproject manager: so that's not\nuser interface: Yeah, but it's just a picture.\nproject manager: just it's just a picture. So {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh.\nproject manager: it's not that cool as I th thought it would be.\nuser interface: You really \nmarketing: Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: Oh, okay.\nuser interface: It's a donkey.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I don't know, what time did we start this meeting, I'm not sure.\nuser interface: Uh I think it was uh \nproject manager: Half past.\nmarketing: Half past ten.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Brilliant.\nproject manager: Okay, perfect.\nindustrial designer: Nice, eh? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: Yeah, thank you. Now we just have to save everything, so. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: this is definitely the best one.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: Okay, so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros. Okay,\nindustrial designer: Excuse me.\nproject manager: that's . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros, so we have to uh use a big market in Europe. The production cost are about half the price of selling price,\nuser interface: Piece of cake.\nproject manager: sorry.\nuser interface: Uh easy.\nproject manager: So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million, I dunno. Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything, so just have a look how it we think about remote controls.\nmarketing: Yeah, my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control?\nproject manager: Oh yeah, that's a good question.\nmarketing: Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television, we sell it uh apart.\nproject manager: I think it's I'm not I'm not sure,\nmarketing: So I \nproject manager: it's not mm I think \nindustrial designer: Yeah, it probably would be universal.\nuser interface: Universal.\nmarketing: Because \nuser interface: And only television? Or more devices?\nproject manager: I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros, so not sure, but \nindustrial designer: Hmm, maybe, I don't know.\nmarketing: Yeah, I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros\nproject manager: Okay, so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. Okay, perfect.\nuser interface: Ah okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, I think.\nindustrial designer: And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player\nproject manager: Yeah, everything\nindustrial designer: and \nproject manager: just so a lot of buttons on the remote control.\nindustrial designer: okay. Yeah, probably.\nuser interface: Not just a T_V_.\nproject manager: No, just everything.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: . so yeah,\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: what what what's a remote control, it's just a black thing with some buttons on it, it's not nothing very special, but um \nuser interface: Well we can try to make it special.\nproject manager: yeah, that's right.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well \nmarketing: Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television,  we don't have uh the same television uh all the time, so uh that's no matter. Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear, because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it, so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons. Um I think it must be a very good control, so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room, the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality.\nproject manager: Hmm yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's right. Should be a good point.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Nothing N\nindustrial designer: And how big should it be?\nmarketing: No. Yeah.\nuser interface: It shouldn't be too big,\nmarketing: I dunno um \nuser interface: but I don't think we can make it too small, 'cause it has to have a lot of functions, so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think.\nproject manager: Just big enough for the buttons we have, that's that's it.\nuser interface: Yeah. Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer,\nmarketing: Yes\nuser interface: maybe more trendy.\nproject manager: But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open.\nuser interface: Fold open,\nproject manager: Okay,\nuser interface: where you can see uh more options. I think \nproject manager: yeah, that's cool. Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something,\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nmarketing: Ah\nindustrial designer: n\nmarketing: that's that's \nproject manager: if you just \nuser interface: Yeah, something uh on top, just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often.\nmarketing: Ah right right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, or you c\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control.\nmarketing: Oh that's good, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah b I wanted \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control?\nindustrial designer: Uh maybe be uh it's it's \nproject manager: There are buttons on it.\nuser interface: No you can make an uh manual in it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small.\nproject manager: Okay. But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it.\nuser interface: But that's \nindustrial designer: Uh like a a to have \nmarketing: Yeah, but\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's much uh too expensive.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, maybe it would.\nmarketing: Yeah but it's not reachable I think, touch screen.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken.\nproject manager: Yeah. So. And if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile.\nuser interface: Yeah, too fragile.\nmarketing: Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh \nproject manager: No. You can put games on your remote control. Whatever. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Kid-proof.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: And uh how about the batteries?\nmarketing: Um \nindustrial designer: Uh should you put it in a recharger or a just \nproject manager: Oh maybe that's a good idea,\nmarketing: Ma maybe a home station.\nproject manager: just to put it on your television and just s recharge,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: you never have to use any batteries.\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah.\nuser interface: Maybe that's a good idea, but yeah, we have to look at the price now I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I dunno.\nuser interface: Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger?\nproject manager: I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah yeah.\nindustrial designer: but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing.\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Maybe have uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh if you th look at the market, it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it, because maybe it's too expensive.\nuser interface: Yeah, 'cause well \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, but a home station is uh a really good idea, because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is,\nproject manager: Yeah, that's right, yeah.\nmarketing: and now you can put it always at the same place.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Maybe it's Therefore it's a good idea, but maybe it's expensive.\nuser interface: Maybe uh use it as a separate option. Sell it uh separately.\nmarketing: Yeah. You can yeah, you can buy it with it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh \nuser interface: Rechargeable.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: or you can change your batteries,\nmarketing: Oh yeah.\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: The option, just the option, that's cool.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh I I set something on paper already, size, looks, uh usable, uh the buttons on usable places, uh the the on off button must be on top,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: uh it has to lay good in the hand,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: you you have to uh \nproject manager: Has it be has does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control\nmarketing: Yeah, I don't I don't know I don't know\nproject manager: or \nuser interface: Well I think we have to look at that,\nmarketing: if we \nuser interface: 'cause well you can do the standard way, but then you won't \nmarketing: You can make it very special, to create our own um looks,\nproject manager: Yeah\nmarketing: but it's very hard to \nindustrial designer: N uh if if we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing, if it really works.\nuser interface: Well you can um have uh the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block, and then the volume uh obviously on t on top, so you can see.\nmarketing: Nah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: But the rest is uh you don't use that often, so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it, it should be clear as well.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: so you can do something unique with that.\nindustrial designer: And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open, when you have it closed, you can still uh do the th the functions.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah, what Paul already said.\nproject manager: Yeah, just for the T_V_ and just the normal function, that's fine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh on on top are the the basic options on top,\nindustrial designer: But n {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah, but uh i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so,\nmarketing: and if you fold it open \nproject manager: But maybe it's\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: \nuser interface: That's what I meant.\nindustrial designer: so.\nproject manager: maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh what's it's called?\nmarketing: Mm. If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control.\nproject manager: Maybe it's hard t\nuser interface: Uh \nproject manager: No, that's right. So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square, just normal remote control .\nuser interface: Okay, but yeah.\nproject manager: Just think about it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting, so.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: There's some more things. We have uh another thirty minutes, so then we're going to meet again. So you know what you have to what you have to do?\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert, the user requirements uh specification, do I need to think as a user, a as a a a only the looks and the \nuser interface: No, what you want to do with it.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_, a D_V_D_ player, all that things. Also from a user, but all these things together.\nmarketing: Okay. Yeah, it's also about strength and uh for everything uh.\nproject manager: Yeah, everything.\nuser interface: Yeah, I also wrote down some stuff\nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: that you want on a \nproject manager: no maybe not not uh , that's not a f that's something for for for yeah.\nuser interface: Technical fun fu\nproject manager: That's not for you.

Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: No, no. Uh this one doesn't want to be moved, I think.\nproject manager: Uh.\nindustrial designer: Too great for email then.\nuser interface: Okay, so. The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Uh I I will focus on user interface design.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Um so move to the next slide. As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions, as we show from this picture. There's a lot of functions. Over, I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control. So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions? Um, let's move to next slide. Um. Yeah. So I so we want to design uh elegant, easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function, but with very easy to use user interface. Um so move to next s slide.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface. So \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation.\nproject manager: So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful.\nuser interface: Uh With sophisticated functions,\nproject manager: So powerful,\nuser interface: but with very yeah powerful.\nproject manager: many functions and very easy to use.\nuser interface: Yes. Yep.\nmarketing: So, I dunno, it's maybe difficult to have both,\nindustrial designer: To merge the two system huh.\nmarketing: I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You mean this one?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control, I suppose.\nindustrial designer: Mm yep.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: But But this is \nuser interface: But if we have very very good user interface\nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and then \nuser interface: it take less time for user to learn how to use it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you maybe you have some international standards, where you know, if you can use one is the other are or almost the same, so the sign.\nproject manager: Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. For example, I dunno here, escape, you know, you have escape in computers you have, so if you see escape, you know that it should be the same.\nmarketing: Oh it should okay, yeah. The user should know.\nindustrial designer: So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international, you know that So.\nproject manager: Yeah um such as maybe the \nindustrial designer: Yeah. So.\nproject manager: Go on, go back and \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system, alright.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's gonna be the trick. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, that's my job. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: That's your job {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That's my job. It's not the easiest I've got to.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It you \nproject manager: So, you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use.\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Powerful and easy to use.\nmarketing: So that's the point.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's the point.\nproject manager: So, next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay.\nproject manager: So you you're \nindustrial designer: Participant two. Yeah.\nproject manager: Um. Okay.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: The rationale must be design, or \nproject manager: So, Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer. Okay.\nindustrial designer: So we can move to the next slide. As you all know, you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control. So the re basically the remote control will be, you know, infrared control, so the problem is how to relate the\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: how to relate the remote control device, like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_. So, this one is leather bu based\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I propose a nifra infrared base you know, so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so you know, so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than, you know For the cheap price we have, for the cheap price we want to \nmarketing: True.\nproject manager: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology?\nindustrial designer: I think it's cheaper than laser, so.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah. Do y you know the requirements for the remote control? Twelve, nearly thirteen,\nmarketing: What the cost is?\nproject manager: yeah. The cost \nmarketing: Twelve, twelve a half.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh Let's see. Yeah. You can move to the next slide, so. So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just, you know a bulb and an infrared bulb, so here for example the infrared bulb will be here\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and the bulb it will be somewhere inside.\nmarketing: That might just So.\nindustrial designer: You can go to the next slide.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I have some kind of pictures you know, here. You have the b the bulb, it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important, so.\nproject manager: What is this?\nindustrial designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Look. But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and .\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So and the next slide, it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know, it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both, but you know, I at my side prefer a wireless.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so if you have some question I didn't answer?\nmarketing: What's the average price of this technology then?\nindustrial designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost, I dunno, around eight Euros, so. Or at least you know, the\nuser interface: So what, the wireless remote control? There's a wire with remote control? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You'd yes, you can. It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know, put some energy inside, so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise, so. We can think that you know, with the wire, you know, without a wire. We can have both also.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno, I just may maybe you making a solu\nmarketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: Wireless remote control.\nproject manager: but \nmarketing: I don't think well, yeah, I don't think he would,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but some pa I always want to have you know,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but in a sense \nindustrial designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know.\nproject manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I'm just asking you. Do you think it will be cheaper?\nindustrial designer: Uh, I don't think it will be too much.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Could you answer please? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Have to think about the question, you know, 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical, so.\nproject manager: Yeah, but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: The wire?\nproject manager: As it's yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. True.\nindustrial designer: Okay, yeah.\nproject manager: I think it's more your problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Uh that's my job. That's the \nproject manager: Okay, I'm sorry.\nmarketing: Now the \nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah but, it should be an agreement, you know, because even if you can think of the wireless, it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer, but you know. If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have, if you want to use, so it can be good to have a wireless, it it is a question.\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: just think of um the usability.\nuser interface: Design a wireless remote control. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Just think of the problem. If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television,\nmarketing: Well that's actually one of the point, yeah? True.\nproject manager: yeah.\nmarketing: This you will see in my presentation then.\nproject manager: So I will let you to do your presentation, so.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Which is participant four. So just trying to answer all the questions, if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh. We've made a study, so could you go to next slide.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sorry for the functional recurrence. So that's the standard method for marketing, okay. We had one hundred subjects, um, we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire, um, and see what was okay or not for them.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay. So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered. Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly, okay, so that's \nproject manager: You mean the loo the look, the outside?\nindustrial designer: The look, how it look like.\nmarketing: Yeah, the the look is is bad for them\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: so uh it's your job, David, maybe. Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly. So this is where we could have uh yeah, good market, I guess, if people are ready to pay more.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So it's it's interesting information, I think. And then um yeah, the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime, because it's too many buttons and so on. So we should change this as well. And uh users are actually zapping a lot, so they're using the device intensively, that's something to take into account as well. And um, you know, ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control. And uh this is one of the main point for me. But I'll come back to it later. 'Kay. Could you go next slide? Uh, so as you said uh,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So this is from the experiments we've done,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user, I think. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people. And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users.\nproject manager: What is R_S_I_?\nmarketing: R_S_I_ is like, when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times, then you get injured.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Ah um okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay? So, those numbers are less important then the previous one, but still it has to be taken to count. So last slide. Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs. If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent, okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of um functions, but less buttons,\nuser interface: Functions.\nmarketing: this would definitely be a good way of selling more. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Mm okay. And just to have uh an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Sure? Yeah?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So lets you then you have less buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah, but do you think it will be easy to use?\nuser interface: But I'm not sure \nproject manager: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know.\nmarketing: Yeah, remember the user is not happy to read the\nindustrial designer: The manuals.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nmarketing: manual.\nproject manager: I think the \nmarketing: It's \nuser interface: No you you can have a switch menu, so you can\nproject manager: Yeah, but it has to be intuitive.\nuser interface: well for example Yeah, I think so. Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes. Then for um you can have a switch menu, so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay. Okay,\nuser interface: Then you you put the switch button,\nproject manager: but \nuser interface: then it switch to another category of functions. Yeah. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder.\nindustrial designer: With a \nuser interface: So there's a different functions, but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder. So we can has less buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah, but \nuser interface: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy, not funny.\nindustrial designer: Look fancy.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people, maybe the the marketing people .\nuser interface: Because different people have a different opinion about fancy. You know.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, this is something we sh\nuser interface: Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people, but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples, so.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But this was first step and This was the first step, yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard \nproject manager: Yeah, but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control.\nmarketing: Specially distribution, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe.\nproject manager: If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more.\nmarketing: Uh \nuser interface: Yeah, personalised colour. Because you know \nproject manager: Yeah, it will cost little bit more.\nuser interface: Yeah, because maybe some people prefer a red remote control,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: some people prefer black remote control.\nmarketing: Yeah, but this is what we would ask to the users, so.\nproject manager: And also f\nuser interface: Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: so user can select which colour they prefer, so.\nproject manager: Yeah, but as soon as you speak about options, it means that the price increases,\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: remember it's twelve Euros.\nproject manager: and we don't really want the price to be too too high, because we wanna be able to produce it. So, we want something fancy, as uh previously said, Florent, something very easy to use, powerful and also as uh it's written here, seventy five percent of users, they zap lot, so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control, they want to zap between channels on T_V_.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and to discuss it with uh the other members.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, is it okay for your presentation? Nothing else to to add?\nmarketing: Yeah, it's done, just yeah. If we would if we could remember like, not too many buttons and make it look fancy, I think it would make it.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm so \nmarketing: So.\nproject manager: So, I had some new information about the product requirements, so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking, in your designing of the remote control. So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, as it's something that's \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: It's is uh \nmarketing: Lame, or \nproject manager: No yeah, because now everybody has internet at home, so it's better to use internet then teletext.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\nproject manager: So, you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control,\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television, so for y for you your designing, you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that.\nuser interface: Control. Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm\nproject manager: because if we want to to do remote control\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: which will be used for for the television, for the recorder, for the camcorder and all the others, it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that. We really want to focus on the remote control for the television. Is it okay?\nuser interface: Okay. But there's balance between function and the cost.\nproject manager: So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it, to have very powerful and easy.\nuser interface: Yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product, such as the colour and s the slogan.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product.\nuser interface: Mm-hm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So you will have to use the colour of the product, of the um um\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: of the uh of real reaction\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So.\nproject manager: and uh also \nmarketing: So has to be yellow.\nindustrial designer: Yellow.\nproject manager: Yeah. As we say, we put the fashion in electronics, so it has to be a fashion remote control. Fancy, fashion, powerful, easy to use.\nuser interface: Okay. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Require lot of requirements,\nindustrial designer: For cheap remote control, yeah.\nproject manager: but \nuser interface: Yeah. And cheap.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: A low cost.\nproject manager: Yeah. But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet, so.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: This is \nmarketing: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway.\nproject manager: Maybe not,\nmarketing: It's maybe more in browsing.\nproject manager: but mayb\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to, you know, connect to internet, you know, surf the web.\nuser interface: Yeah, there's that box in uh o of it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: A pi There's that box in the T_V_, so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Ok\nmarketing: Hm-mm.\nuser interface: It's It's not so uh popular now. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's pop I don't think it's popular, so that's the problem so. You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: the global usage,\nuser interface: Global,\nindustrial designer: so if people don't have the technology.\nuser interface: okay.\nproject manager: So.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So everybody is okay with the new requirements?\nuser interface: So I I so As as for the colour, what what do you think?\nproject manager: I think it has to be yellow.\nindustrial designer: Yellow? Do you think that people like the colour yellow? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yellow? T_V_ remote control? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Min\nproject manager: Maybe you can change the colour, but the image of the society has to be recognised.\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be.\nproject manager: Why you go It has to be fashion.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so. Doesn't need to be completely yellow,\nproject manager: So you have to \nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: but just mm.\nproject manager: Yeah. It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society. Just when you enter you say oh, oh, it's real reaction. Think it's a re reaction remote control, so.\nuser interface: Okay, okay. Okay.\nproject manager: And also it has to be attractive, of course,\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: because if you want to sale to sell the remote control. It's okay?\nmarketing: Regarding the first line, what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: And that's it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I dunno, but why, nobody's a threat to me.\nmarketing: It's already changed for \nproject manager: I think it would be simpler.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay. So I will close the meeting, um just after that we'll have lunch break. And you will have in thirty minutes individual work. Uh Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon\nmarketing: Industrial Designer.\nindustrial designer: Industrial Designer, yeah. Component component, yeah.\nproject manager: yeah, and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: And Florent to work my subject.\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: It's okay?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I think the um session is closed.\nindustrial designer: Good.\nproject manager: And by the way, Mister David Jordan, please record your presentations in your own folder.

The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Uh I I will focus on user interface design.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Um so move to the next slide. As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions, as we show from this picture. There's a lot of functions. Over, I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control. So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions? Um, let's move to next slide. Um. Yeah. So I so we want to design uh elegant, easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function, but with very easy to use user interface. Um so move to next s slide.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface.

For example, I dunno here, escape, you know, you have escape in computers you have, so if you see escape, you know that it should be the same.\nmarketing: Oh it should okay, yeah. The user should know.\nindustrial designer: So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international, you know that So.\nproject manager: Yeah um such as maybe the \nindustrial designer: Yeah. So.\nproject manager: Go on, go back and \nindustrial designer: Yeah, but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system, alright.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's gonna be the trick. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, that's my job. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: That's your job {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That's my job.

Okay.\nindustrial designer: So we can move to the next slide. As you all know, you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control. So the re basically the remote control will be, you know, infrared control, so the problem is how to relate the\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: how to relate the remote control device, like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_. So, this one is leather bu based\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but I propose a nifra infrared base you know, so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so you know, so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than, you know For the cheap price we have, for the cheap price we want to \nmarketing: True.\nproject manager: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology?\nindustrial designer: I think it's cheaper than laser, so.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah. Do y you know the requirements for the remote control? Twelve, nearly thirteen,\nmarketing: What the cost is?\nproject manager: yeah. The cost \nmarketing: Twelve, twelve a half.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh Let's see. Yeah. You can move to the next slide, so. So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just, you know a bulb and an infrared bulb, so here for example the infrared bulb will be here\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and the bulb it will be somewhere inside.\nmarketing: That might just So.\nindustrial designer: You can go to the next slide.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I have some kind of pictures you know, here. You have the b the bulb, it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important, so.\nproject manager: What is this?\nindustrial designer: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Look. But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and .\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So and the next slide, it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know, it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both, but you know, I at my side prefer a wireless.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so if you have some question I didn't answer?\nmarketing: What's the average price of this technology then?\nindustrial designer: Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost, I dunno, around eight Euros, so. Or at least you know, the\nuser interface: So what, the wireless remote control? There's a wire with remote control? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You'd yes, you can. It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know, put some energy inside, so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise, so. We can think that you know, with the wire, you know, without a wire. We can have both also.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno, I just may maybe you making a solu\nmarketing: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: Wireless remote control.\nproject manager: but \nmarketing: I don't think well, yeah, I don't think he would,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but some pa I always want to have you know,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but in a sense \nindustrial designer: sometime I want to have wire because you know.\nproject manager: Yeah but as Industrial Designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I'm just asking you. Do you think it will be cheaper?\nindustrial designer: Uh, I don't think it will be too much.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Could you answer please? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Have to think about the question, you know, 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical, so.\nproject manager: Yeah, but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: The wire?\nproject manager: As it's yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. True.\nindustrial designer: Okay, yeah.\nproject manager: I think it's more your problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Uh that's my job. That's the \nproject manager: Okay, I'm sorry.\nmarketing: Now the \nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah but, it should be an agreement, you know, because even if you can think of the wireless, it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer, but you know. If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have, if you want to use, so it can be good to have a wireless, it it is a question.\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: just think of um the usability.\nuser interface: Design a wireless remote control. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Just think of the problem. If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television,\nmarketing: Well that's actually one of the point, yeah? True.\nproject manager: yeah.\nmarketing: This you will see in my presentation then.\nmarketing: So it's it's interesting information, I think. And then um yeah, the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime, because it's too many buttons and so on. So we should change this as well. And uh users are actually zapping a lot, so they're using the device intensively, that's something to take into account as well. And um, you know, ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control. And uh this is one of the main point for me. But I'll come back to it later. 'Kay. Could you go next slide? Uh, so as you said uh,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So this is from the experiments we've done,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user, I think. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people. And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users.\nproject manager: What is R_S_I_?\nmarketing: R_S_I_ is like, when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times, then you get injured.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Ah um okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay? So, those numbers are less important then the previous one, but still it has to be taken to count. So last slide. Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs. If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent, okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of um functions, but less buttons,\nuser interface: Functions.\nmarketing: this would definitely be a good way of selling more. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Mm okay. And just to have uh an idea, do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control, you think it's possible?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Sure? Yeah?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So lets you then you have less buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah, but do you think it will be easy to use?\nuser interface: But I'm not sure \nproject manager: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know.\nmarketing: Yeah, remember the user is not happy to read the\nindustrial designer: The manuals.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nmarketing: manual.\nproject manager: I think the \nmarketing: It's \nuser interface: No you you can have a switch menu, so you can\nproject manager: Yeah, but it has to be intuitive.\nuser interface: well for example Yeah, I think so. Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes. Then for um you can have a switch menu, so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay. Okay,\nuser interface: Then you you put the switch button,\nproject manager: but \nuser interface: then it switch to another category of functions. Yeah. For example, if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder.\nindustrial designer: With a \nuser interface: So there's a different functions, but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder.

Or should be.\nproject manager: Why you go It has to be fashion.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so. Doesn't need to be completely yellow,\nproject manager: So you have to \nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: but just mm.\nproject manager: Yeah. It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society. Just when you enter you say oh, oh, it's real reaction. Think it's a re reaction remote control, so.\nuser interface: Okay, okay.

{"fname": "product_test_135", "dialogue": "project manager: 'Kay. Hmm. Okay everybody. Welcome to the detailed design meeting. Um Let's see. Our agenda. Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. Um and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas. Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary. Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that. Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it. Um so actually I think Yeah um f you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay well um. So our design looks something like this. This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever. This is a button, serves as the power button if you hold it down, and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu. And uh the base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel, is interchangeable. So you can change the colour, according to your to suit your living room or whatever. And it comes \nuser interface: You could change the vegetable, or fruit.\nindustrial designer: yeah, I can change the vegetable.\nproject manager: Oh is that broccoli? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: This one's broccoli.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want. This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it. This is a mango.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The it's trendy fruit, it's not just ordinary fruits.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You don't have orange, you have mango. Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy, but {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'S a very bright strawberry. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control. And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them, because they'll need to switch 'em out.\nuser interface: It's been a l\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable, and that the user can use it, you know, it's not too big. Uh but we think that this you know, this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually, would be the um thing the locator. How how so \nindustrial designer: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there.\nuser interface: Okay so that's just \nindustrial designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere\nuser interface: So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the \nindustrial designer: Yeah we didn't design that.\nuser interface: Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed.\nindustrial designer: But it would be coordinating with that of course.\nuser interface: Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: You could have a broccoli, or you could have a mango. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So. Tada.\nproject manager: Oh. Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder, there's an Excel spreadsheet. Um the only one that's in there, production costs. And if you open it up. Um I've just stuck the numbers in, it was a real challenge there. But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something that has changed \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean, we decided on batteries, and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button. Um I said uncurved or flat. I think that's what you have there, is that right? For the for the plastic part would be \nindustrial designer: My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes.\nproject manager: Oh. Okay.\nindustrial designer: But it's really not very clear, because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means.\nproject manager: Right.\nindustrial designer: One side is curved and then the other side is curved.\nproject manager: Well yeah. If we're talking about the area just oh I d I dunno. I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so what else? There's plastic for that area around the button. Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um and lots of special colours actually. Uh scroll wheel. Do you see anything that I've missed?\nindustrial designer: No I think that's alright.\nproject manager: Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine, which is even less than twelve point five, which means we'd be making even more of a profit.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And if we sold a lot of squishy things.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Boo yeah. Okay. S So Mm. Did y what did you work on? The \nmarketing: Um evaluation criteria.\nproject manager: Okay. Do you wanna \nmarketing: I've got a presentation.\nproject manager: Okay. I think that's \nmarketing: So I need where's the cable? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start. Um. Right. This doesn't okay. Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing. And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, and this is everything's listed down. Um, look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use. These are all things we looked at at the start, um and criteria that have to be met. We have to use a table, I'll show you that later, together to decide whether it meets the standards. And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I would like to show you the table we have to use. Um. No. This is the table. Can you see this here?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down? True is one and and false is seven. And we'll just go through each point together, hopefully. Um. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I dunno how it works exactly, I haven't been told.\nuser interface: Yeah. Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own \nmarketing: Yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents.\nuser interface: Is it meeting three minutes? No it's not minutes.\nmarketing: It's called evaluation criteria.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: And it's under evaluation.\nproject manager: Huh, the PowerPoint one?\nindustrial designer: Hmm?\nuser interface: Okay. Cool.\nmarketing: Yeah. You've found it all?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So it was um Yeah true's one.\nuser interface: True's one and false is seven.\nmarketing: Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly?\nproject manager: Um we can do it separately and then discuss it\nmarketing: Yeah okay.\nproject manager: if if that's what people wanna do.\nuser interface: So it's actually a scale.\nproject manager: Wait, one is true and {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um,\nproject manager: so these are the questions we're answering. And one is \nmarketing: yes it's if it's fancy you put one,\nproject manager: One, right okay.\nmarketing: if it's really unfancy it's seven.\nproject manager: If it's somewhere in between you put four.\nmarketing: Yeah, something.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay. Does it feel fancy?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Feels like play-dough.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: They shouldn't really be questions. Should be more like Are the batteries easy to insert? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I'm gonna say yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes? Very very true. Okay.\nindustrial designer: I imagine they're somewhere on the front. We have a little case that you slip 'em in.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Are we just about ready?\nmarketing: Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard. Do we um is it necessary?\nproject manager: I don't think so. It's \nmarketing: We'll just do um \nproject manager: yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: Our animals will forever be there.\nmarketing: Yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: Un unless you feel you need it t to \nmarketing: I don't feel any {vocalsound}\nproject manager: okay okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We'll \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: right um Right so one point one? We'll just go in a circle.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: Five.\nmarketing: Right. Ooh I don't know.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. One?\nindustrial designer: Five.\nproject manager: Five.\nmarketing: Five.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Two. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? Is that what the company does?\nproject manager: I I think we should \nindustrial designer: It's four if you wanna do that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It adds to sixteen, so that's four.\nmarketing: Oh no. It adds to thirteen. One five five two.\nindustrial designer: Oh I thought she said five.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: One five five two is thirteen, over four for now. I think that's um next?\nuser interface: Um three.\nindustrial designer: Six.\nproject manager: Six.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Really? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Two.\nproject manager: I wasn't cheating I swear.\nmarketing: Uh-oh. Right. One point three is \nuser interface: So it's a one was true and seven was false?\nproject manager: Uh.\nindustrial designer: Huh?\nuser interface: Okay, so you guys really didn't like it?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Oh I thought it was the other way round.\nindustrial designer: Wait a minute.\nmarketing: I really \nindustrial designer: I thought it was the other way round too.\nproject manager: So we do have about the same thing, we just have it the other way {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points, you know, all the way up to the top.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah. It was one is true and false is seven.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I should've kept the table up.\nproject manager: Oh gosh. Okay. Well \nindustrial designer: I'll just I'll just reverse them all. It's no problem.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right, well I'm glad this came out.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I thought you guys hated it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I was like, why did you guys design it that way if you hated it? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No. Oh that's quite funny.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. \nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. So, starting again, one point one?\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: Say two.\nproject manager: Three.\nmarketing: Two. Okay, one point two?\nuser interface: Uh three.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nproject manager: Two.\nmarketing: Two. Okay. Um, one point three?\nuser interface: One.\nproject manager: One.\nindustrial designer: One.\nmarketing: Ha. Two point one?\nproject manager: Two.\nuser interface: Uh two.\nindustrial designer: Uh two.\nproject manager: Two point I think I missed two. Wait, is that two point one?\nindustrial designer: Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: One point four, one point five. Okay right\nmarketing: Oh dear, okay. Sorry.\nproject manager: that's I have two of them.\nindustrial designer: Mine has all kinds of problems.\nmarketing: Two and one.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sorry about that. T two point two, which is one point five.\nproject manager: One.\nindustrial designer: Uh three. Wait why did I put three?\nuser interface: Uh one.\nindustrial designer: I meant one on mine too.\nmarketing: Okay. Three point one. Is that correct on my slide?\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah?\nuser interface: Uh one.\nindustrial designer: Three point one. I have four.\nproject manager: Three.\nmarketing: One, four, three, three, three point two?\nindustrial designer: Three.\nproject manager: Three.\nuser interface: Uh. One.\nmarketing: Three point three.\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: One.\nproject manager: Two.\nmarketing: Four point one?\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nproject manager: Five.\nmarketing: Two. Four point two.\nuser interface: Two.\nindustrial designer: Three.\nproject manager: Four.\nmarketing: Two and four point three.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: One, two.\nuser interface: One.\nproject manager: Two.\nmarketing: Right so I put one on that.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue.\nproject manager: Okay. Um \nmarketing: Or is it tedious? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone.\nproject manager: No no that's um I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four, where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote.\nmarketing: I didn't know how else to do it. Okay. Well the worst ones were three point one.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Do does every ones have the slide?\nproject manager: The \nmarketing: Three point one.\nproject manager: that was material.\nmarketing: Slide show. Material technologically innovative, okay. Um,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: do you want to change it? What are the suggestions? I don't know, anyone? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: Which one is that again sorry? Three point one?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah that it's three point one was not that good. Four point one.\nproject manager: Does the shape \nmarketing: The shape.\nuser interface: I think \nmarketing: Four point two?\nproject manager: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it uh gonna be the size, like the the controller? It or bigger?\nindustrial designer: I think the wheel would probably be mm.\nproject manager: Because \nuser interface: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And like then it you could hold it in your hand better.\nindustrial designer: I think the base would definitely be larger, 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. They're kinda smallish.\nproject manager: Yeah. No but I imagine even if it was bigger, like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: The flat one. Yeah.\nproject manager: so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position.\nuser interface: I didn't yeah. But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat \nindustrial designer: Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable. Mm.\nuser interface: But it's still too big I think, in your hand. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. And would it even resemble fruit that way?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: like you could probably do a strawberry still.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think the broccoli would be out.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say, like sorta like a joystick.\nproject manager: Yeah that I I when you were holding that before, it actually looked yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. That looked really good.\nuser interface: I don't know. So \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Are there any fruits that look like broccoli, no?\nuser interface: Uh.\nindustrial designer: Not that I can think of. Rhubarb. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Rhubarb.\nmarketing: I think that broccoli is my favourite actually.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: These obscure fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh despite the \nuser interface: I think we needn't \nproject manager: What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber.\nuser interface: Huh?\nproject manager: You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah.\nuser interface: Oh okay.\nindustrial designer: So it's just colour, and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry.\nuser interface: Yeah. That could work.\nmarketing: Yeah. \nproject manager: Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean \nuser interface: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: But if we if we need \nmarketing: Yeah and just have the colour match or something.\nproject manager: yeah. And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow, there might be \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Or like I dunno, some of 'em you can kind of think see as like \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: like you could if it was only this you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that. But you see the problem is you have to attach that, and this has to be detachable.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: So like maybe that's just too big\nproject manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that,\nuser interface: because \nproject manager: which is a nice kind of \nuser interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah. But \nuser interface: I dunno.\nproject manager: I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape?\nuser interface: I guess \nproject manager: 'Cause like kind of \nindustrial designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Or like even \nuser interface: Dif\nindustrial designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough.\nproject manager: Or even like Yeah like you said, like a joystick like that. You know?\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped.\nproject manager: 'Cause that, I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And you still have the comfort of holding it like that.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Alright.\nproject manager: But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that?\nmarketing: Um \nuser interface: We could tr I don't know.\nmarketing: Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one.. Batteries easy to insert for some reason,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more.\nproject manager: The batteries are going in the back?\nindustrial designer: That everyone gave that a one or a two. Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip \nindustrial designer: No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door,\nproject manager: no you could Just like any other one. Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah um like on a normal remote.\nproject manager: Right.\nindustrial designer: So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there, but it'd be on one of the sides probably.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: I think everyone's under three anyway.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: So I think it's yeah those are the only two points.\nuser interface: Cool. Well Yeah the broccoli I guess wins.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Um, I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We were a bit off task.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um so uh I can't think of any So we'll have to like Mm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah I dunno. You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes, but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like,\nindustrial designer: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape.\nuser interface: but you could do like Yeah that's true.\nproject manager: Yeah. And it would probably cost more to produce, 'cause they're irregular.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah that's true. Mm.\nindustrial designer: I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.\nproject manager: Yeah. Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: Mm. Not really Well we've done finance evaluation criteria, production evaluation. Um so project evaluation.\nmarketing: Do you want this and we can all No.\nproject manager: I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh, oh it's alright. Uh. Yeah.\nmarketing: It's alright yeah?\nproject manager: Um Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of \nindustrial designer: Sure.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I did.\nproject manager: I mean fruit and squishiness. How c more creative can you get? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Sponginess. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The prototype making was very creatively stimulating\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria.\nproject manager: And how was our leadership and teamwork? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think it was good. We knew what we were doing. It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute.\nproject manager: Well I thought my leadership was crap personally.\nindustrial designer: Well you told us when to start and when to end, and that's all that matters.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Excuse me, am I allowed to say that? Yeah. Um.\nuser interface: I think you were fine.\nproject manager: Yeah, well I'm never gonna do a management position, I know that now.\nuser interface: You did a good job leading.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um yeah, I thought we all worked very well together.\nmarketing: Yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much, as we just would be like I don't know, all had ideas about it but \nproject manager: Yeah. Very democratic. No spats, that was good.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um and the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? Like the the pens, the whiteboard,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean we used \nindustrial designer: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff.\nproject manager: Are you a Mac person? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No no I never touch Macs either.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I just use the Unix or the off market, sort of WordPerfect and all these other things.\nproject manager: Huh.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: Which isn't very user-friendly though. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it. So I have all these documents I can't use now. But yeah I mean I guess it's okay.\nuser interface: I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role, but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had. But there's kinda it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: So I didn't really think it was helpful. So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally, think it's kinda stupid.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I never use it.\nuser interface: Yeah but uh \nproject manager: I can't say I found everything particularly helpful. Like I \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: It didn't really yeah.\nproject manager: It \nindustrial designer: My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works.\nmarketing: I though it was brilliant no? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Really? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think.\nproject manager: I mean m my problem \nindustrial designer: Yeah it probably does.\nuser interface: So like a f\nmarketing: I think it depends on the role\nproject manager: yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah I think so.\nmarketing: no?\nproject manager: 'Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: See I couldn't do that, so I didn't really know what you guys were doing. And when you were talking about it I was just like \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'cause I \nindustrial designer: Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: As if you'd wanted to.\nmarketing: Yeah. But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um\nproject manager: System. Yeah.\nmarketing: a whole system,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah I mean, it \nindustrial designer: Well I think it's interesting how it all went together, like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap, and you have how people want it to be spongy, and \nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, huh.\nindustrial designer: It seems planned you know.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information, or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: because {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time. But um \nproject manager: Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: No. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's \nindustrial designer: If I hadn't been told that fruit was \nmarketing: But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing.\nproject manager: Oh right. given certain information or Just \nmarketing: Yeah, like if everyone's given the same input \nproject manager: yeah.\nmarketing: I don't have a clue, anyway.\nproject manager: Mm, mm.\nmarketing: Um what's next? Looks like oh no that's not um \nproject manager: What do you guys think of the pens?\nmarketing: It's quite \nproject manager: It asks about that.\nindustrial designer: They're pretty cool.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: I wanna s\nindustrial designer: They're kinda hard to write with though.\nproject manager: Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the \nindustrial designer: They're nicer than the pen that I'm using, because like your stuff actually shows up here, rather than having to look at the screen and write.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: But even so, I dunno.\nproject manager: And new ideas found?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah it's all very new,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: no? It's all very new.\nuser interface: Yeah I think I'd like to um I dunno. Like it was the \nmarketing: Sorry.\nuser interface: I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down, but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah. Well they drop off if you like move too much.\nuser interface: Yeah I dunno. But they're they're okay.\nindustrial designer: But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones. Maybe we are.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: I don't know. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh I think, and I think that uh all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well the thing is, like I actually worked in a company,\nuser interface: or like I dunno.\nindustrial designer: and I had a role and I had to go to meetings. And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting. Like usually I missed meetings deliberately.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting, like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's mostly like rehashing old stuff.\nuser interface: Hm.\nindustrial designer: And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through.\nproject manager: Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration.\nindustrial designer: It seems like way overkill.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I guess it would be it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful, 'cause can't really imagine, dunno. How about a p a?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um I dunno.\nproject manager: Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Any other ideas for \nmarketing: What what's the end? Are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report? Or we ending?\nproject manager: Um we still have time if there's any other input.\nmarketing: Is that the end?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean the I think we did really well personally, which is why we've you know, gone through this so quickly. 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, and it's trendy.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So. Um.\nmarketing: End of meeting. You have to tell her, she \nproject manager: So I think that's all for today. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay we have to fill in all this stuff.\nuser interface: M meeting adjourned.\nmarketing: Stuff stuff stuff.\nproject manager: Meeting adjourned.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think it would be a good idea, I like it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention. Especially if you have food.\nproject manager: So I guess we're supposed to write final reports. 'Cause \nindustrial designer: All of us?\nproject manager: I don't know. Hmm.\nmarketing: Well there's al eight, nine.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ooh. Oh ooh.\nproject manager: Hmm.

{"fname": "product_test_136", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Okay well um. So our design looks something like this. This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever. This is a button, serves as the power button if you hold it down, and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu. And uh the base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel, is interchangeable. So you can change the colour, according to your to suit your living room or whatever. And it comes \nuser interface: You could change the vegetable, or fruit.\nindustrial designer: yeah, I can change the vegetable.\nproject manager: Oh is that broccoli? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: This one's broccoli.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want. This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it. This is a mango.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The it's trendy fruit, it's not just ordinary fruits.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You don't have orange, you have mango. Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy, but {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'S a very bright strawberry. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control. And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them, because they'll need to switch 'em out.\nuser interface: It's been a l\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable, and that the user can use it, you know, it's not too big. Uh but we think that this you know, this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually, would be the um thing the locator. How how so \nindustrial designer: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there.\nuser interface: Okay so that's just \nindustrial designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere\nuser interface: So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the \nindustrial designer: Yeah we didn't design that.\nuser interface: Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed.\nindustrial designer: But it would be coordinating with that of course.\nuser interface: Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: You could have a broccoli, or you could have a mango. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So. Tada.\nproject manager: Oh. Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder, there's an Excel spreadsheet. Um the only one that's in there, production costs. And if you open it up. Um I've just stuck the numbers in, it was a real challenge there. But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something that has changed \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean, we decided on batteries, and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button. Um I said uncurved or flat. I think that's what you have there, is that right? For the for the plastic part would be \nindustrial designer: My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes.\nproject manager: Oh. Okay.\nindustrial designer: But it's really not very clear, because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means.\nproject manager: Right.\nindustrial designer: One side is curved and then the other side is curved.\nproject manager: Well yeah. If we're talking about the area just oh I d I dunno. I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so what else? There's plastic for that area around the button. Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um and lots of special colours actually. Uh scroll wheel. Do you see anything that I've missed?\nindustrial designer: No I think that's alright.\nproject manager: Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine, which is even less than twelve point five, which means we'd be making even more of a profit.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And if we sold a lot of squishy things.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Boo yeah. Okay. S So Mm. Did y what did you work on? The \nmarketing: Um evaluation criteria.\nproject manager: Okay. Do you wanna \nmarketing: I've got a presentation.\nproject manager: Okay. I think that's \nmarketing: So I need where's the cable? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start. Um. Right. This doesn't okay. Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing. And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, and this is everything's listed down. Um, look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use. These are all things we looked at at the start, um and criteria that have to be met. We have to use a table, I'll show you that later, together to decide whether it meets the standards. And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I would like to show you the table we have to use. Um. No. This is the table. Can you see this here?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down? True is one and and false is seven. And we'll just go through each point together, hopefully. Um. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I dunno how it works exactly, I haven't been told.\nuser interface: Yeah. Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own \nmarketing: Yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents.\nuser interface: Is it meeting three minutes? No it's not minutes.\nmarketing: It's called evaluation criteria.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: And it's under evaluation.\nproject manager: Huh, the PowerPoint one?\nindustrial designer: Hmm?\nuser interface: Okay. Cool.\nmarketing: Yeah. You've found it all?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So it was um Yeah true's one.\nuser interface: True's one and false is seven.\nmarketing: Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly?\nproject manager: Um we can do it separately and then discuss it\nmarketing: Yeah okay.\nproject manager: if if that's what people wanna do.\nuser interface: So it's actually a scale.\nproject manager: Wait, one is true and {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um,\nproject manager: so these are the questions we're answering. And one is \nmarketing: yes it's if it's fancy you put one,\nproject manager: One, right okay.\nmarketing: if it's really unfancy it's seven.\nproject manager: If it's somewhere in between you put four.\nmarketing: Yeah, something.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay. Does it feel fancy?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Feels like play-dough.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: They shouldn't really be questions. Should be more like Are the batteries easy to insert? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I'm gonna say yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes? Very very true. Okay.\nindustrial designer: I imagine they're somewhere on the front. We have a little case that you slip 'em in.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Are we just about ready?\nmarketing: Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard. Do we um is it necessary?\nproject manager: I don't think so. It's \nmarketing: We'll just do um \nproject manager: yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: Our animals will forever be there.\nmarketing: Yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: Un unless you feel you need it t to \nmarketing: I don't feel any {vocalsound}\nproject manager: okay okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We'll \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: right um Right so one point one? We'll just go in a circle.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: Five.\nmarketing: Right. Ooh I don't know.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. One?\nindustrial designer: Five.\nproject manager: Five.\nmarketing: Five.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Two. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? Is that what the company does?\nproject manager: I I think we should \nindustrial designer: It's four if you wanna do that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It adds to sixteen, so that's four.\nmarketing: Oh no. It adds to thirteen. One five five two.\nindustrial designer: Oh I thought she said five.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: One five five two is thirteen, over four for now. I think that's um next?\nuser interface: Um three.\nindustrial designer: Six.\nproject manager: Six.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Really? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Two.\nproject manager: I wasn't cheating I swear.\nmarketing: Uh-oh. Right. One point three is \nuser interface: So it's a one was true and seven was false?\nproject manager: Uh.\nindustrial designer: Huh?\nuser interface: Okay, so you guys really didn't like it?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Oh I thought it was the other way round.\nindustrial designer: Wait a minute.\nmarketing: I really \nindustrial designer: I thought it was the other way round too.\nproject manager: So we do have about the same thing, we just have it the other way {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points, you know, all the way up to the top.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah. It was one is true and false is seven.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I should've kept the table up.\nproject manager: Oh gosh. Okay. Well \nindustrial designer: I'll just I'll just reverse them all. It's no problem.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right, well I'm glad this came out.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I thought you guys hated it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I was like, why did you guys design it that way if you hated it? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No. Oh that's quite funny.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. \nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. So, starting again, one point one?\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: Say two.\nproject manager: Three.\nmarketing: Two. Okay, one point two?\nuser interface: Uh three.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nproject manager: Two.\nmarketing: Two. Okay. Um, one point three?\nuser interface: One.\nproject manager: One.\nindustrial designer: One.\nmarketing: Ha. Two point one?\nproject manager: Two.\nuser interface: Uh two.\nindustrial designer: Uh two.\nproject manager: Two point I think I missed two. Wait, is that two point one?\nindustrial designer: Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: One point four, one point five. Okay right\nmarketing: Oh dear, okay. Sorry.\nproject manager: that's I have two of them.\nindustrial designer: Mine has all kinds of problems.\nmarketing: Two and one.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sorry about that. T two point two, which is one point five.\nproject manager: One.\nindustrial designer: Uh three. Wait why did I put three?\nuser interface: Uh one.\nindustrial designer: I meant one on mine too.\nmarketing: Okay. Three point one. Is that correct on my slide?\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah?\nuser interface: Uh one.\nindustrial designer: Three point one. I have four.\nproject manager: Three.\nmarketing: One, four, three, three, three point two?\nindustrial designer: Three.\nproject manager: Three.\nuser interface: Uh. One.\nmarketing: Three point three.\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: One.\nproject manager: Two.\nmarketing: Four point one?\nuser interface: One.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nproject manager: Five.\nmarketing: Two. Four point two.\nuser interface: Two.\nindustrial designer: Three.\nproject manager: Four.\nmarketing: Two and four point three.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: One, two.\nuser interface: One.\nproject manager: Two.\nmarketing: Right so I put one on that.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue.\nproject manager: Okay.

{"fname": "product_test_137", "dialogue": "project manager: No no that's um I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four, where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote.\nmarketing: I didn't know how else to do it. Okay. Well the worst ones were three point one.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Do does every ones have the slide?\nproject manager: The \nmarketing: Three point one.\nproject manager: that was material.\nmarketing: Slide show. Material technologically innovative, okay. Um,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: do you want to change it? What are the suggestions? I don't know, anyone? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: Which one is that again sorry? Three point one?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah that it's three point one was not that good. Four point one.\nproject manager: Does the shape \nmarketing: The shape.\nuser interface: I think \nmarketing: Four point two?\nproject manager: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it uh gonna be the size, like the the controller? It or bigger?\nindustrial designer: I think the wheel would probably be mm.\nproject manager: Because \nuser interface: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And like then it you could hold it in your hand better.\nindustrial designer: I think the base would definitely be larger, 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. They're kinda smallish.\nproject manager: Yeah. No but I imagine even if it was bigger, like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: The flat one. Yeah.\nproject manager: so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position.\nuser interface: I didn't yeah. But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat \nindustrial designer: Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable. Mm.\nuser interface: But it's still too big I think, in your hand. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. And would it even resemble fruit that way?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: like you could probably do a strawberry still.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think the broccoli would be out.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say, like sorta like a joystick.\nproject manager: Yeah that I I when you were holding that before, it actually looked yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. That looked really good.\nuser interface: I don't know. So \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Are there any fruits that look like broccoli, no?\nuser interface: Uh.\nindustrial designer: Not that I can think of. Rhubarb. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Rhubarb.\nmarketing: I think that broccoli is my favourite actually.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: These obscure fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh despite the \nuser interface: I think we needn't \nproject manager: What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber.\nuser interface: Huh?\nproject manager: You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah.\nuser interface: Oh okay.\nindustrial designer: So it's just colour, and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry.\nuser interface: Yeah. That could work.\nmarketing: Yeah. \nproject manager: Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean \nuser interface: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: But if we if we need \nmarketing: Yeah and just have the colour match or something.\nproject manager: yeah. And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow, there might be \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Or like I dunno, some of 'em you can kind of think see as like \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: like you could if it was only this you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that. But you see the problem is you have to attach that, and this has to be detachable.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: So like maybe that's just too big\nproject manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that,\nuser interface: because \nproject manager: which is a nice kind of \nuser interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah. But \nuser interface: I dunno.\nproject manager: I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape?\nuser interface: I guess \nproject manager: 'Cause like kind of \nindustrial designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Or like even \nuser interface: Dif\nindustrial designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough.\nproject manager: Or even like Yeah like you said, like a joystick like that. You know?\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped.\nproject manager: 'Cause that, I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And you still have the comfort of holding it like that.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.

It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute.\nproject manager: Well I thought my leadership was crap personally.\nindustrial designer: Well you told us when to start and when to end, and that's all that matters.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Excuse me, am I allowed to say that?

Very democratic. No spats, that was good.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um and the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? Like the the pens, the whiteboard,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean we used \nindustrial designer: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff.\nproject manager: Are you a Mac person? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No no I never touch Macs either.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I just use the Unix or the off market, sort of WordPerfect and all these other things.\nproject manager: Huh.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: Which isn't very user-friendly though. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it. So I have all these documents I can't use now. But yeah I mean I guess it's okay.\nuser interface: I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role, but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had. But there's kinda it was kinda like okay, I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: So I didn't really think it was helpful. So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally, think it's kinda stupid.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I never use it.\nuser interface: Yeah but uh \nproject manager: I can't say I found everything particularly helpful. Like I \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: It didn't really yeah.\nproject manager: It \nindustrial designer: My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works.\nmarketing: I though it was brilliant no? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Really? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think.\nproject manager: I mean m my problem \nindustrial designer: Yeah it probably does.\nuser interface: So like a f\nmarketing: I think it depends on the role\nproject manager: yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah I think so.\nmarketing: no?\nproject manager: 'Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: See I couldn't do that, so I didn't really know what you guys were doing. And when you were talking about it I was just like \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'cause I \nindustrial designer: Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: As if you'd wanted to.\nmarketing: Yeah. But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um\nproject manager: System. Yeah.\nmarketing: a whole system,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah I mean, it \nindustrial designer: Well I think it's interesting how it all went together, like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap, and you have how people want it to be spongy, and \nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, huh.\nindustrial designer: It seems planned you know.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information, or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: because {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time. But um \nproject manager: Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: No. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's \nindustrial designer: If I hadn't been told that fruit was \nmarketing: But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing.\nproject manager: Oh right. given certain information or Just \nmarketing: Yeah, like if everyone's given the same input \nproject manager: yeah.\nmarketing: I don't have a clue, anyway.\nproject manager: Mm, mm.\nmarketing: Um what's next? Looks like oh no that's not um \nproject manager: What do you guys think of the pens?\nmarketing: It's quite \nproject manager: It asks about that.\nindustrial designer: They're pretty cool.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: I wanna s\nindustrial designer: They're kinda hard to write with though.\nproject manager: Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the \nindustrial designer: They're nicer than the pen that I'm using, because like your stuff actually shows up here, rather than having to look at the screen and write.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: But even so, I dunno.\nproject manager: And new ideas found?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah it's all very new,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: no? It's all very new.\nuser interface: Yeah I think I'd like to um I dunno. Like it was the \nmarketing: Sorry.\nuser interface: I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down, but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah. Well they drop off if you like move too much.\nuser interface: Yeah I dunno. But they're they're okay.\nindustrial designer: But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones. Maybe we are.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: I don't know. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh I think, and I think that uh all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well the thing is, like I actually worked in a company,\nuser interface: or like I dunno.\nindustrial designer: and I had a role and I had to go to meetings. And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting. Like usually I missed meetings deliberately.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting, like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's mostly like rehashing old stuff.\nuser interface: Hm.\nindustrial designer: And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through.\nproject manager: Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration.\nindustrial designer: It seems like way overkill.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I guess it would be it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful, 'cause can't really imagine, dunno. How about a p a?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um I dunno.\nproject manager: Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Any other ideas for \nmarketing: What what's the end? Are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report? Or we ending?\nproject manager: Um we still have time if there's any other input.\nmarketing: Is that the end?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean the I think we did really well personally, which is why we've you know, gone through this so quickly. 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, and it's trendy.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So. Um.\nmarketing: End of meeting. You have to tell her, she \nproject manager: So I think that's all for today. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay we have to fill in all this stuff.\nuser interface: M meeting adjourned.\nmarketing: Stuff stuff stuff.\nproject manager: Meeting adjourned.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think it would be a good idea, I like it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention.

I don't know, anyone? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um \nuser interface: Which one is that again sorry? Three point one?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah that it's three point one was not that good. Four point one.\nproject manager: Does the shape \nmarketing: The shape.\nuser interface: I think \nmarketing: Four point two?\nproject manager: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it uh gonna be the size, like the the controller? It or bigger?\nindustrial designer: I think the wheel would probably be mm.\nproject manager: Because \nuser interface: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And like then it you could hold it in your hand better.\nindustrial designer: I think the base would definitely be larger, 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. They're kinda smallish.\nproject manager: Yeah. No but I imagine even if it was bigger, like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: The flat one. Yeah.\nproject manager: so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there, like it's an awkward position.\nuser interface: I didn't yeah. But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat \nindustrial designer: Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable. Mm.\nuser interface: But it's still too big I think, in your hand. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. And would it even resemble fruit that way?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: like you could probably do a strawberry still.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think the broccoli would be out.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say, like sorta like a joystick.\nproject manager: Yeah that I I when you were holding that before, it actually looked yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. That looked really good.\nuser interface: I don't know. So \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Are there any fruits that look like broccoli, no?\nuser interface: Uh.\nindustrial designer: Not that I can think of. Rhubarb. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Rhubarb.\nmarketing: I think that broccoli is my favourite actually.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: These obscure fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh despite the \nuser interface: I think we needn't \nproject manager: What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber.\nuser interface: Huh?\nproject manager: You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah.\nuser interface: Oh okay.\nindustrial designer: So it's just colour, and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry.\nuser interface: Yeah. That could work.\nmarketing: Yeah. \nproject manager: Or I mean we could even have fruit like around {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean \nuser interface: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: But if we if we need \nmarketing: Yeah and just have the colour match or something.\nproject manager: yeah. And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow, there might be \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Or like I dunno, some of 'em you can kind of think see as like \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: like you could if it was only this you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that. But you see the problem is you have to attach that, and this has to be detachable.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: So like maybe that's just too big\nproject manager: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that,\nuser interface: because \nproject manager: which is a nice kind of \nuser interface: Yeah it's sorta like a joystick.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah. But \nuser interface: I dunno.\nproject manager: I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape?\nuser interface: I guess \nproject manager: 'Cause like kind of \nindustrial designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours, and call 'em the different fruits.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Or like even \nuser interface: Dif\nindustrial designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough.\nproject manager: Or even like Yeah like you said, like a joystick like that. You know?\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped.\nproject manager: 'Cause that, I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And you still have the comfort of holding it like that.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: And you could like if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.

Okay. Okay. So, this is our product or prototype. This is made by clay.\nproject manager: Looks strange. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red. Yellow is uh our company colour,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: uh red it's uh is more attractive. So we used two basic colour, yellow and red. And the shape, there's two basic shape. The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: It's we call it a mushroom design.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh \nuser interface: So this is a introduction of our product.\nproject manager: Genetically modified mushroom I will say, but\nuser interface: Next a mo\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay,\nproject manager: keep on speaking.\nuser interface: yeah, so next slide. So there are several key features of our pr prototype. The first is that it is fuzzy. I'm sure this would be the unique design the market.\nproject manager: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah I'm sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe, I hope so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, so it's a fuzzy design, and a unique design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's true.\nuser interface: Um, and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection. In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle, so we can turn this ball to t to select channel.\nproject manager: Chan\nuser interface: So it's quite convenient for user to use it.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay, but don't touch don't destroy your prototype. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, s {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: okay. Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base. Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable, so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it. So it's v Um, you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button. You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom, so {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Everything's mushroom. So we can call our remote control the mushroom.\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah, everything's mushroom. Mush Mushroom design, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape, you know, centre is yellow and t d\nuser interface: Yeah\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, th that's why if you put it in the table, be careful, somebody will eat it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: To integrate, you know yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't think I hope nobody will eat it You know, to integrate the fruit aspect, you know the the in\nproject manager: Oh.\nuser interface: Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends. I mean there was fruits yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Fruits and vegetables.\nindustrial designer: Really? But Fruit and vegetable,\nproject manager: Vegetables. Mushroom is a vegetable.\nindustrial designer: so mushroom was a kind of you know uh \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't think it is.\nproject manager: It's vegetable.\nindustrial designer: Mushroom?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Oh, uh I'm not sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So th it's something eatable.\nindustrial designer: We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but you know we we integrated them with different colour.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway, so it's fine.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know. This, you know, very enlighted colours, you know.\nmarketing: No, I mean, yeah yeah. Inspira inspiration is \nindustrial designer: And inspired colour\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and and very sophisticated material, so.\nmarketing: True.\nindustrial designer: And so {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Next slide.\nuser interface: Uh, no this our only two slides. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: So what we w what I can add is that, you know he talk about what is outside, so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about, you know, the chip,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: it is a low level chip, and \nuser interface: So we cut it to see. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You know, we don't need to k.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i\nuser interface: Okay. So where's the battery battery?\nindustrial designer: The battery it is under .\nproject manager: In the base.\nindustrial designer: It is in th in in the base, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: In the basement. In the basement.\nuser interface: Base. Here?\nproject manager: And where is the solar solar cell?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But we say uh we sa we said solar.\nproject manager: Where is the solar cell?\nindustrial designer: In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and \nproject manager: Oh. Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price?\nuser interface: Okay\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't think so,\nproject manager: Okay, we'll see after.\nindustrial designer: but it it's might be okay, so.\nproject manager: We will have first to \nindustrial designer: I it might be okay. So \nproject manager: so, mister money, what's your opinion according to this remote control?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean, we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and first one was uh\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale, one being uh no, I think.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh just let me check.\nindustrial designer: So, four point three point five, it means it's acceptable.\nmarketing: One one being true, and seven being false. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Oops.\nmarketing: Ouch. So\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Do we have a fancy look and feel, according to you?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think so.\nindustrial designer: I think you have nice colours. I don't {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But is it \nindustrial designer: The sha the bowl shape people like.\nuser interface: Yeah, the shape is unique, and the colour \nmarketing: Uh I'll agree it's unique, but is it really \nindustrial designer: Is it really fancy?\nuser interface: So it depend on how d do you define fancy.\nmarketing: Yeah I mean, fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, and maybe do things like that \nindustrial designer: Do Don't do that, please.\nmarketing: I dunno where the lemon is, but\nindustrial designer: I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like, so \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean it's not obvious.\nproject manager: It would be bet more like a lemon?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: If \nindustrial designer: Because i\nmarketing: I dunno, maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Less button.\nuser interface: Uh so, my mush .\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: Looks like more fruit. Maybe a pineapple?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but you don't have any button now.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: And you know, you have the finger here, with the buttons?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's uh yeah, is that \nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: that's a good idea.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's getting \nproject manager: It looks more like a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: So that's great. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Sorry.\nindustrial designer: That's great. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What's the use for that?\nindustrial designer: I have no idea, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh, for turn turn the ball. If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I have no idea what {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And where is the voice recognition?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh. Ah, it's embedded, your microphone.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Th this th th there's two two functions.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's Wait th that's the second point.\nuser interface: This is microphone array \nmarketing: First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: If it is fancy or not.\nproject manager: Okay. Is it better like that?\nmarketing: I mean {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Looks okay,\nindustrial designer: So we can we can say t\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: let's say it's a pineapple now. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The colour, is the colour acceptable?\nmarketing: No, the colour is okay, that's fine.\nindustrial designer: So the shape now.\nmarketing: I mean it's \nproject manager: It looks like a \nmarketing: but I would say there is more too much red.\nproject manager: now you took it.\nindustrial designer: It's too much red?\nmarketing: Um if\nindustrial designer: In the basement?\nproject manager: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Right. So, from one to seven?\nindustrial designer: I will give I will \nproject manager: Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum?\nindustrial designer: I'll gi\nmarketing: No, seven is false and one is true.\nindustrial designer: I'll give two or three.\nproject manager: Three, I will say three.\nindustrial designer: Three, it's okay. Three, three. Three is fine for me.\nmarketing: Three?\nuser interface: 'Kay\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Isn't it bitter like that?\nmarketing: Three.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Then uh let me \nindustrial designer: What other \nmarketing: The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative.\nindustrial designer: Is it easy to use? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Feasible? You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an\nindustrial designer: Ye uh Embedded.\nuser interface: Yeah, this is microphone array, in fact.\nindustrial designer: It's a micro array, okay.\nuser interface: There four microphone.\nproject manager: Oh. Okay,\nuser interface: So they they they they there's a microphone array.\nproject manager: and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments?\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative?\nuser interface: So you can capture voice yeah, you c\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so you can capture s voice from different directions. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control, so it is I\nmarketing: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno, in the core, or single.\nindustrial designer: W Yeah, but \nproject manager: We have tactile buttons.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I see, you have microphone array embedded. You have \nmarketing: No, that's good. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's good.\nproject manager: Oh, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, th that's another really good point. Maybe okay.\nindustrial designer: I think technically it's acceptable, so \nproject manager: Maybe two?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So using the same scale, two?\nproject manager: Two? I would say two\nindustrial designer: Two, yeah, two. It's it's fine, so.\nproject manager:. You agree?\nuser interface: Yeah, I agree.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: It's better like that, isn't it?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Now maybe the most critical one.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Most \nmarketing: L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use?\nindustrial designer: Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. But it's just speaking.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very easy.\nindustrial designer: You just need the command.\nuser interface: You can use this in this way.\nmarketing: Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: As a principle. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Please.\nuser interface: Th this is the base.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can turn to change the channel.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?\nuser interface: You just tu turn d d\nindustrial designer: I think maybe if you he\nproject manager: Oh, ok I understand.\nmarketing: Like if you want to go from \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You take take the remote, so \nindustrial designer: If you hear some click \nproject manager: and you can turn like that to change the channel? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but imagine you y\nproject manager: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping, but maybe it will be too fast. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty?\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: How can you go directly to twenty, for example? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, no, no. I if y uh if \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: it depend on the the angle you turn the \nmarketing: Yeah. I agree. I agree.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y how you need to know I \nmarketing: But I mean if you're fro from two?\nuser interface: I if if this is a channel one. So it c it could be channel two, channel three, channel four, channel five.\nindustrial designer: I think something that Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, you have a, like that, and so on.\nuser interface: So change. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you you can \nmarketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh \nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree.\nmarketing: We're not talking Yeah.\nuser interface: So you got how many degree you you it \nproject manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go \nindustrial designer: I think you can if you have a scale, so \nuser interface: No no, you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop, the the turn,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you \nmarketing: Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one?\nuser interface: It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the \nmarketing: So you you count one degree, two degrees, no.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do it.\nmarketing: I don't think so. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's a bit difficult.\nuser interface: I think so I think so you can do it. I think so, you can just change.\nindustrial designer: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay, so \nmarketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main \nuser interface: There's uh also a number, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah, but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So, when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty, so you can say channel twenty, or channel four, because you really want to go on this channel.\nindustrial designer: Uh, yeah, and y that's yeah.\nproject manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.\nmarketing: And this would be more for browsing, ah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. To see uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah uh \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Seems to be good.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good choice, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I mean you're famous. You .\nindustrial designer: And but I'd \nuser interface: And also you can, if you i\nproject manager: yeah, what's what's this cherry?\nuser interface: You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this.\nindustrial designer: It is a turn off t turn off button, maybe.\nuser interface: For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two, you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's like fine, from coarse to fine.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: This is coarse, this is fine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah yeah. That's\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So it's coarse to fine design.\nindustrial designer: that's very technologic, so. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah is is this is, from one channel to maybe to ten channel.\nindustrial designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates\nuser interface: This is from one channel to \nindustrial designer: maybe one of the \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, th you have the vocal commands.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's k \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: On off.\nindustrial designer: on off, yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, sleeping.\nmarketing: Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah.\nproject manager: That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah.\nindustrial designer: To compensate .\nmarketing: Solar.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: So, which number?\nproject manager: three.\nindustrial designer: Easy to use, it's very relative but three it's fine, I think, it's reasonable three. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you agree?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Three?\nuser interface: Yeah, agree, agree.\nmarketing: So reasonably, is four, is one?\nindustrial designer: Three f three for me, it's o it's okay.\nmarketing: So, three.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And what's your opinion?\nindustrial designer: Will you give four?\nmarketing: Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me.\nindustrial designer: Five? Yeah, so maybe if \nuser interface: Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button, but now you don't have to put button, you have you just turn the turn the ball.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y you know \nuser interface: There's two kind of balls,\nmarketing: So you have \nuser interface: the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: But in the traditional controller, how do how can you control the scale?\nmarketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one.\nindustrial designer: You just push two button, zero and and one.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: And that's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah, yeah, y you you can do it, but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Are there some buttons? Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, this function is just for your browsing, from one channel to th the next one, the next s sn s, the th the third one.\nproject manager: It's not what you said previously.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Previously you said that turning this was the fine \nmarketing: Yeah, if you're changing your mind.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Fine to coarse.\nproject manager: Fine to coarse.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And from ten to ten channels here.\nuser interface: Y one to ten, ten to twelve, uh ten to t uh twenty. Ten to twenty and this one, t one two three four five six, like this.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh there's different scale, so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc\nmarketing: Okay. But this this has to stay on the table, right?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: This has to stay on the table.\nindustrial designer: In fact on a flat place \nuser interface: I i this is just a base. You can just \nindustrial designer: You can {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it \nproject manager: Oh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, no no, no. You can't put it out.\nindustrial designer: Oh ye yes, that's right.\nmarketing: Just It's \nproject manager: It's just your turning from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's impossible. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh\nproject manager: You need to put it on and turn. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point,\nuser interface: You use your y\nmarketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand.\nproject manager: Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control.\nindustrial designer: my God.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So th this is a d next generation controller. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nobody would take it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sure. Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah.\nproject manager: So nobody w will lost lose it.\nindustrial designer: yeah maybe, maybe may\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's the next prototype, maybe we cou\nuser interface: Okay okay, okay.\nproject manager: S maybe we can change from th\nindustrial designer: Four. Maybe four, it's okay.\nuser interface: Four. Okay.\nproject manager: Four? Easy to use, four.\nindustrial designer: I'll put four.\nproject manager: Gonna say four.\nmarketing: Four.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable.\nmarketing: Uh it's even easier to maybe.\nindustrial designer: You can you can erase with this er yeah.\nmarketing: Ok\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so. So it's nine,\nmarketing: So, average?\nindustrial designer: nine over three.\nuser interface: Three?\nmarketing: Three?\nproject manager: Trois. Three. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, it's .\nuser interface: Trois. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay, so \nindustrial designer: It need maybe some wo further work, but it's \nmarketing: Yeah, especially on the easy to use\nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh s yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: target.\nindustrial designer: Might it might be fine.\nproject manager: So, th the project is accepted?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, b I think \nproject manager: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So uh mm mm. Mm.\nindustrial designer: That's the finance.\nproject manager: Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation. So as we all agree to accept, under certain conditions, the prototype, we'll have look to the final sh financial view.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm. Okay.\nproject manager: So we need to calculate the production cost. As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet, so\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: so it has the energy source. We have hand dynamo. No, we don't use that.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: We have battery, right?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we have battery.\nproject manager: Kinetic, we don't have it, I suppose,\nindustrial designer: No,\nproject manager: but we have solar cells.\nindustrial designer: um solar cells, yeah.\nproject manager: Um, how many do y do you need, solar cells? Do you think one would be enough, or such as as number of branches?\nindustrial designer: Uh I think in each ball you have three \nproject manager: Three?\nindustrial designer: three uh yeah, three, yeah. Three three solar cells.\nproject manager: So, electronic. Single simple chip on print? Just one would be necessary?\nindustrial designer: S s simple, simple, yeah.\nproject manager: One?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Zero for the others. And sample sensor, sample speaker. One?\nindustrial designer: Mm. One maybe, yeah.\nproject manager: As we have voice recognition, I think.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: So the case.\nindustrial designer: Is it \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is sh it \nmarketing: So we are all already nineteen.\nindustrial designer: Wooden. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: just keep on going, just to have an idea.\nuser interface: The solar cell is too expensive. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's \nproject manager: Well uh \nindustrial designer: There's no wood, so plastic just only, I think.\nproject manager: yeah, but what what about case? Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved. I think it's more like double curved.\nmarketing: That's gonna be double curved, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Double curve, yeah, double curve.\nproject manager: One?\nindustrial designer: One, you have.\nproject manager: Uh wood? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's yeah, a a rubber uh \nmarketing: Rather four buttons.\nproject manager: Uh do we need special colour?\nmarketing: Oh no, interface.\nproject manager: Y maybe, two? We have two special colours.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. Y y yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah that's special colours, sure.\nproject manager: Push button.\nuser interface: Mm. Yeah, we have four.\nindustrial designer: Five?\nuser interface: Five. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Scroll wheel. We don no.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: It it's more like integrated scor.\nindustrial designer: I think that this will be like a scroll wheel, actually.\nuser interface: No no.\nmarketing: Yeah tha that's wheel.\nindustrial designer: Y you tu you turn you turn it, so \nuser interface: No no no, it Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe two scroll wheel, as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, true. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Scr\nproject manager: So, no button supplements?\nmarketing: I think the price is okay.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Um, no.\nproject manager: Okay we I think we have problem. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: L_C_ display, maybe. Interface.\nproject manager: I think we s if we keep on adding things \nindustrial designer: It's okay. fine .\nproject manager: so we have to \nmarketing: Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells.\nproject manager: Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Has it changed.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it was stage one, so.\nmarketing: No y i it did change, but\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip. Oh.\nmarketing: just imagine we have \nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: We have to delete the the sample sensor, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, but we have you the the voice recognition,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: no?\nmarketing: Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really \nuser interface: Yeah it's the one it's \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: m maybe we ha we have two versions, the first version, the basic version.\nindustrial designer: I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe.\nuser interface: Advanced version we have speak.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Because uh it seems that this can be \nmarketing: Yeah, if \nproject manager: Or it would be better.\nindustrial designer: yeah, wood into plastic and it it should be fine.\nuser interface: Plastic is free. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, do we need special colour?\nmarketing: Yeah, that's one of the requirement.\nproject manager: Because we have red.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, red and yellow.\nproject manager: Red and yellow.\nuser interface: Wait.\nindustrial designer: Fancy.\nuser interface: We we can we can we c {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black.\nuser interface: yellow.\nmarketing: Black then is a regular colour, so.\nproject manager: I think so we need if we try to have a kind of\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Yeah, one.\nproject manager: pineapple bee. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. So push button then it's it's the next expensive one.\nproject manager: Yeah. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. And I think this is one. Integrated scroll wheel push button\nmarketing: Yeah, thi this might be.\nproject manager:. So we'll we have only one? And push button.\nmarketing: Close to.\nproject manager: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button, it's uh \nindustrial designer: One. I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons, so we can just, I dunno, try to modify some of them to have yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, so what's the bottleneck?\nuser interface: How about we change the sale?\nmarketing: Double curved.\nindustrial designer: Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah.\nproject manager: Something flat.\nindustrial designer: F some \nmarketing: Yeah, but flat \nproject manager: S uncurved. Yeah, maybe not.\nindustrial designer: Single curve .\nmarketing: Case, what's the ca\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Single curve should be fine, so. Oh, what {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm. Nearly.\nuser interface: Ah we have one {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And then one Euro left.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um.\nproject manager: Maybe don't bat no battery, only solar cells.\nindustrial designer: It's it's a bad idea, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: I think there's a problem with the push push button. We only need maybe just one.\nindustrial designer: Two?\nproject manager: Just one.\nindustrial designer: One. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's fine. That's fine. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. Okay. Agree.\nproject manager: So yeah, you will have \nmarketing: So we have one button,\nindustrial designer: One s one scroll wheel, so\nmarketing: one wheel.\nproject manager: So one button, and s scroll wheel with push button on it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And the vocal chord, it's fine. It I th it's fine.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: It's good they're not charging anything for that. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, yeah. It think we we've done good job, as the cost is\nuser interface: Cou could we have look \nproject manager: twelve fifty e\nuser interface: Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost?\nmarketing: Yeah y actually it's wrong. We're not under twelve Euros and a half.\nproject manager: Yeah, but it's under or equal. It's not written. Sometimes it's under or equal.\nindustrial designer: It's fine. It's under or equal. It's fine, so \nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. So let's say \nproject manager: Twelve fifty.\nuser interface: Wha what \nindustrial designer: It's fine, twelve fifty uh \nuser interface: yeah. Which part is the most expensive part? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Solar cells.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think.\nindustrial designer: The solar cells, r is i is it?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's not t t\nproject manager: I think, yeah. But it would i be interesting for our marketing team, to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be \nindustrial designer: Yeah, to be able to si to sell it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Cheaper.\nmarketing: That's nice argument,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, with mi\nmarketing: but if it's it's still four our of twelve.\nindustrial designer: It's it is really really uh really very very expensive, though.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe if uh okay.\nproject manager: Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but we just have one button. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's easy to use and powerful, as the remote control a has only one button.\nmarketing: Easy. I don't know about powerful. Yeah.\nproject manager: Easy, powerful.\nindustrial designer: It's easy to use. It's very easy to use. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Uh that's what we've just done.\nindustrial designer: We've done it with it is under the if it was low, high or so.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Um okay.\nproject manager: Now \nindustrial designer: So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation?\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Well I think we have just have to discuss if \nindustrial designer: Okay, okay, it's fine.\nmarketing: I dunno.\nproject manager: So did you enjoy your clay modelling?\nuser interface: Yes. Of course. This is my job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah? Was it a nice way to create your remote control?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it's uh it's good, to to create a control instead of a computer. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end. And designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And for the marketing guy?\nmarketing: Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards, so it um.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay.\nproject manager: And new ideas about new products, maybe, wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yellow. I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It can be an interesting I don't know \nproject manager: Yes, just lemon.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon.\nuser interface: Yeah, but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um \nindustrial designer: It's flat, uh \nuser interface: Yeah yeah it's flat,\nproject manager: Squared?\nuser interface: yeah the shape is very boring.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's right. It's really boring, yeah.\nuser interface: Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can you have base, triangle base so you the T_V_ you can \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah, the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's that would be really interesting, actually.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Because the T_V_ you also \nproject manager: Oh, that's interesting. You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things. Electronic device.\nindustrial designer: Device devi\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, but just don't trust too much the trends.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The fruit? Yeah.\nproject manager: Maybe \nmarketing: 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe la next year it will be insects.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's \nmarketing: Maybe two years it's dead.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after, you know, if the people change their mind you change also the product.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long long life product.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: T_V_ is more like fifteen years, maybe, so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. That's a yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for\nindustrial designer: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones, you know.\nmarketing: fifteen years \nproject manager: Customable T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, you customise it every ti so every ti if people change, you just change the appearance, and y y you can keep \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Ah such yeah. You've already said mobile phones.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Tha that would that would make it. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, you can keep the global appearan\nproject manager: Yeah, and following \nindustrial designer: The mood of persons, the fashions uh \nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's interesting, maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr\nindustrial designer: We int Yeah, T_V_, yeah. A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter, you know, so it's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So what i and do w is it Okay.\nproject manager: So I think the costs are within the budget. We're just at twelve fifty Euros.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, the pr at \nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: do you think you can celebrate your creation?\nuser interface: And you can celebrate your leadership. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh, thanks a lot. Thank you, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object. So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy, so.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. It's party party remote control.\nproject manager: The thing now is to to sell it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it's your job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Sell it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: right, go and sell it. Goo and good luck, so {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh-huh. Twenty five Euros.\nuser interface: Twenty five Euros, yeah.\nindustrial designer: It should be fine.\nmarketing: Yeah, I think it's \nproject manager: It's maybe a little bit expensive. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Twenty five Euros.\nmarketing: It's cheap, yeah. No, I \nuser interface: No, it's not so expensive.\nmarketing: I'm not so happy about the fruit shape, you know.\nindustrial designer: Wh really?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It should be it should be fine, you know, actually. S\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Maybe what you can do a test. Put it outside, and if bees come, it's really fruit. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good, so actually so \nproject manager: But don't put sugar in it, it's not working.\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No, the colours are uh it's perfect, yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's perfect, and \nmarketing: True. Uh yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still.\nindustrial designer: I p is th y {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but the colour, I think the colour is more is most important,\nindustrial designer: the the yellow ball thing that \nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control.\nmarketing: Still that was one of the requirements we had. It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere.\nindustrial designer: Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ \nproject manager: Yeah, but we decided to have something yellow and red, for the costs.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side, the double R_.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Okay yeah, yeah. That's actually good idea, so \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: So we have the logo, we have the colour, and we have the fashion in electronics,\nuser interface: So we have to give a \nproject manager: so we have the slogan too.\nuser interface: So we have give him give it a cute name.\nproject manager: Yeah\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: th no, it's the it's the pineapple control remote control.\nuser interface: Mush mushroom controller.\nmarketing: Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend.\nproject manager: It's a pineapple now, it has changed. It's a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: It's not a mushroom. It's a pineapple remote controls.\nmarketing: It's not the trend.\nproject manager: Pineapple.\nuser interface: Pa Pine apple.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, pineapple remote remote control.\nmarketing: Yeah, but just flying saucer, or \nproject manager: With cherry on top.\nindustrial designer: Oh, that \nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: I would say flying saucer.\nindustrial designer: Oh unid uh unidentified remote control, so {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's more appropriate, somehow.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: That's that's pineapple remote control. I think it's fine.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Will you buy one?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah I will try I'll try {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Try to. Okay uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Twenty five Euro.\nindustrial designer: . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage \nuser interface: Okay. Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_\nindustrial designer: Yeah I always lose my Yeah, so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_, so it would be \nuser interface: so you need to buy one.\nproject manager: One thing I like is the shape, because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket, on uh in your jacket.\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: \nuser interface: Traditional one? Yeah. So this one and this one. What do you choose?\nproject manager: I prefer the laser remote control. No.\nindustrial designer: I think I would choose this one because of the colour. It's\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: What do you choose? Okay.\nindustrial designer: it's will enlight your house, your home and your T_V_, so.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Oh. Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah that would be uh an idea.\nmarketing: Yeah but that's going to be expensive, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno.\nindustrial designer: .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one, and maybe add some features to it after yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, afterwards, if\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: if it's a new trend. Okay.\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah that's that fine. So we can celebrate now. That's our new product.\nproject manager: Champagne , mister Baba. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: We should celebrate.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's it's fine. It's I like it. Next time. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So buy one. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, I'll buy one here.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay, I will close this. Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. No?\nproject manager: So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: and we have a nearly final product.\nmarketing: Our final prototype which yeah.\nindustrial designer: Final prototype, yeah, ye yeah.\nproject manager: Final prototype, right.\nuser interface: Prototype, yeah.\nproject manager: So, thank you very much.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Very productive.\nuser interface: Okay.

First, the user interface designer presented a prototype to show the basic colour and shape of the product. Next, the marketing suggested doing some product evaluation instead of just talking about it, so the group started to judge the design in three aspects: how fancy, technologically innovative, and easy-to-use the remote control was. It got three, two, and four in separate aspects, which meant the design was acceptable. Later, the group discussed the quotation and made some decisions on details of industrial design to make sure the cost was within the budget. Furthermore, they came up with some new ideas about future products, such as a fruit collection of electronic devices or a customizable TV that followed the trend and people's moods. Finally, the group named the product as pineapple remote control.", "zh_summary": "这次会议是关于具体设计的。首先，用户界面部对样机进行介绍以展示产品的基本颜色和形状。接下来，市场营销部建议对产品进行评估，而不只是停留在讨论的层面，所以团队开始从美观程度、技术创新和是否好用这三个方面来评估设计，分别给出了了3分、2分和4分，也就是说该设计方案可行。接着，开发团队讨论了报价，并对产品设计的细节作出了一些决定，以确保成本在预算之内。此外，他们对未来的产品提出了一些新的想法，如水果系列的电子设备或者根据潮流和人的情绪而定制电视。最后，开发团队决定将该产品命名为菠萝遥控器。", "fr_summary": "Il s'agissait d'une réunion sur la conception détaillée.

Він отримав три, два та чотири бали за окремими аспектами, що означало прийнятний проект. Пізніше група обговорила цінову пропозицію та прийняла деякі рішення щодо деталей промислового дизайну, щоб переконатися, що вартість відповідає бюджету.

{"fname": "product_test_143", "dialogue": "user interface: Yep. Okay. Okay. So, this is our product or prototype. This is made by clay.\nproject manager: Looks strange. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red. Yellow is uh our company colour,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: uh red it's uh is more attractive. So we used two basic colour, yellow and red. And the shape, there's two basic shape. The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: It's we call it a mushroom design.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh \nuser interface: So this is a introduction of our product.\nproject manager: Genetically modified mushroom I will say, but\nuser interface: Next a mo\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay,\nproject manager: keep on speaking.\nuser interface: yeah, so next slide. So there are several key features of our pr prototype. The first is that it is fuzzy. I'm sure this would be the unique design the market.\nproject manager: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah I'm sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe, I hope so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, so it's a fuzzy design, and a unique design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's true.\nuser interface: Um, and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection. In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle, so we can turn this ball to t to select channel.\nproject manager: Chan\nuser interface: So it's quite convenient for user to use it.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay, but don't touch don't destroy your prototype. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, s {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: okay. Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base. Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable, so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it. So it's v Um, you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button. You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom, so {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Everything's mushroom. So we can call our remote control the mushroom.\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah, everything's mushroom. Mush Mushroom design, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape, you know, centre is yellow and t d\nuser interface: Yeah\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, th that's why if you put it in the table, be careful, somebody will eat it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: To integrate, you know yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't think I hope nobody will eat it You know, to integrate the fruit aspect, you know the the in\nproject manager: Oh.\nuser interface: Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends. I mean there was fruits yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Fruits and vegetables.\nindustrial designer: Really? But Fruit and vegetable,\nproject manager: Vegetables. Mushroom is a vegetable.\nindustrial designer: so mushroom was a kind of you know uh \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't think it is.\nproject manager: It's vegetable.\nindustrial designer: Mushroom?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Oh, uh I'm not sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So th it's something eatable.\nindustrial designer: We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but you know we we integrated them with different colour.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway, so it's fine.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know. This, you know, very enlighted colours, you know.\nmarketing: No, I mean, yeah yeah. Inspira inspiration is \nindustrial designer: And inspired colour\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and and very sophisticated material, so.\nmarketing: True.\nindustrial designer: And so {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Next slide.\nuser interface: Uh, no this our only two slides. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: ", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion about product appearance.", "zh_query": "总结有关产品外观的讨论。", "fr_query": "Résumez la discussion sur l'apparence du produit.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте обговорення зовнішнього вигляду продукту.", "en_summary": "The user interface designer put forward that the basic colour would be red and yellow and there would be two basic shapes - circle and triangle, which was called a mushroom design.

{"fname": "product_test_146", "dialogue": "project manager: so, mister money, what's your opinion according to this remote control?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean, we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and first one was uh\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale, one being uh no, I think.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh just let me check.\nindustrial designer: So, four point three point five, it means it's acceptable.\nmarketing: One one being true, and seven being false. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Oops.\nmarketing: Ouch. So\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Do we have a fancy look and feel, according to you?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think so.\nindustrial designer: I think you have nice colours. I don't {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But is it \nindustrial designer: The sha the bowl shape people like.\nuser interface: Yeah, the shape is unique, and the colour \nmarketing: Uh I'll agree it's unique, but is it really \nindustrial designer: Is it really fancy?\nuser interface: So it depend on how d do you define fancy.\nmarketing: Yeah I mean, fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, and maybe do things like that \nindustrial designer: Do Don't do that, please.\nmarketing: I dunno where the lemon is, but\nindustrial designer: I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like, so \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean it's not obvious.\nproject manager: It would be bet more like a lemon?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: If \nindustrial designer: Because i\nmarketing: I dunno, maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Less button.\nuser interface: Uh so, my mush .\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: Looks like more fruit. Maybe a pineapple?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but you don't have any button now.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah. I dunno.\nproject manager: And you know, you have the finger here, with the buttons?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's uh yeah, is that \nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: that's a good idea.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's getting \nproject manager: It looks more like a pineapple.\nindustrial designer: So that's great. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Sorry.\nindustrial designer: That's great. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What's the use for that?\nindustrial designer: I have no idea, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh, for turn turn the ball. If you want to turn the ball, it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I have no idea what {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And where is the voice recognition?\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh. Ah, it's embedded, your microphone.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Th this th th there's two two functions.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's Wait th that's the second point.\nuser interface: This is microphone array \nmarketing: First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel.\nindustrial designer: If it is fancy or not.\nproject manager: Okay. Is it better like that?\nmarketing: I mean {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Looks okay,\nindustrial designer: So we can we can say t\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: let's say it's a pineapple now. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The colour, is the colour acceptable?\nmarketing: No, the colour is okay, that's fine.\nindustrial designer: So the shape now.\nmarketing: I mean it's \nproject manager: It looks like a \nmarketing: but I would say there is more too much red.\nproject manager: now you took it.\nindustrial designer: It's too much red?\nmarketing: Um if\nindustrial designer: In the basement?\nproject manager: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Right. So, from one to seven?\nindustrial designer: I will give I will \nproject manager: Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum?\nindustrial designer: I'll gi\nmarketing: No, seven is false and one is true.\nindustrial designer: I'll give two or three.\nproject manager: Three, I will say three.\nindustrial designer: Three, it's okay. Three, three. Three is fine for me.\nmarketing: Three?\nuser interface: 'Kay\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Isn't it bitter like that?\nmarketing: Three.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Then uh let me \nindustrial designer: What other \nmarketing: The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative.\nindustrial designer: Is it easy to use? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Feasible? You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an\nindustrial designer: Ye uh Embedded.\nuser interface: Yeah, this is microphone array, in fact.\nindustrial designer: It's a micro array, okay.\nuser interface: There four microphone.\nproject manager: Oh. Okay,\nuser interface: So they they they they there's a microphone array.\nproject manager: and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments?\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative?\nuser interface: So you can capture voice yeah, you c\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so you can capture s voice from different directions. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control, so it is I\nmarketing: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno, in the core, or single.\nindustrial designer: W Yeah, but \nproject manager: We have tactile buttons.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I see, you have microphone array embedded. You have \nmarketing: No, that's good. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's good.\nproject manager: Oh, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, th that's another really good point. Maybe okay.\nindustrial designer: I think technically it's acceptable, so \nproject manager: Maybe two?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So using the same scale, two?\nproject manager: Two? I would say two\nindustrial designer: Two, yeah, two. It's it's fine, so.\nproject manager:. You agree?\nuser interface: Yeah, I agree.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: It's better like that, isn't it?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Now maybe the most critical one.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Most \nmarketing: L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use?\nindustrial designer: Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. But it's just speaking.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very easy.\nindustrial designer: You just need the command.\nuser interface: You can use this in this way.\nmarketing: Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: As a principle. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Please.\nuser interface: Th this is the base.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can turn to change the channel.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?\nuser interface: You just tu turn d d\nindustrial designer: I think maybe if you he\nproject manager: Oh, ok I understand.\nmarketing: Like if you want to go from \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You take take the remote, so \nindustrial designer: If you hear some click \nproject manager: and you can turn like that to change the channel? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but imagine you y\nproject manager: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping, but maybe it will be too fast. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty?\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: How can you go directly to twenty, for example? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, no, no. I if y uh if \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: it depend on the the angle you turn the \nmarketing: Yeah. I agree. I agree.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y how you need to know I \nmarketing: But I mean if you're fro from two?\nuser interface: I if if this is a channel one. So it c it could be channel two, channel three, channel four, channel five.\nindustrial designer: I think something that Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, you have a, like that, and so on.\nuser interface: So change. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you you can \nmarketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh \nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree.\nmarketing: We're not talking Yeah.\nuser interface: So you got how many degree you you it \nproject manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go \nindustrial designer: I think you can if you have a scale, so \nuser interface: No no, you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop, the the turn,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you \nmarketing: Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one?\nuser interface: It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the \nmarketing: So you you count one degree, two degrees, no.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do it.\nmarketing: I don't think so. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's a bit difficult.\nuser interface: I think so I think so you can do it. I think so, you can just change.\nindustrial designer: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay, so \nmarketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main \nuser interface: There's uh also a number, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah, but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So, when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty, so you can say channel twenty, or channel four, because you really want to go on this channel.\nindustrial designer: Uh, yeah, and y that's yeah.\nproject manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.\nmarketing: And this would be more for browsing, ah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. To see uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah uh \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Seems to be good.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good choice, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I mean you're famous. You .\nindustrial designer: And but I'd \nuser interface: And also you can, if you i\nproject manager: yeah, what's what's this cherry?\nuser interface: You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this.\nindustrial designer: It is a turn off t turn off button, maybe.\nuser interface: For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two, you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's like fine, from coarse to fine.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: This is coarse, this is fine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah yeah. That's\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So it's coarse to fine design.\nindustrial designer: that's very technologic, so. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah is is this is, from one channel to maybe to ten channel.\nindustrial designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates\nuser interface: This is from one channel to \nindustrial designer: maybe one of the \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, th you have the vocal commands.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's k \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: On off.\nindustrial designer: on off, yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, sleeping.\nmarketing: Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah.\nproject manager: That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah.\nindustrial designer: To compensate .\nmarketing: Solar.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: So, which number?\nproject manager: three.\nindustrial designer: Easy to use, it's very relative but three it's fine, I think, it's reasonable three. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you agree?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Three?\nuser interface: Yeah, agree, agree.\nmarketing: So reasonably, is four, is one?\nindustrial designer: Three f three for me, it's o it's okay.\nmarketing: So, three.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And what's your opinion?\nindustrial designer: Will you give four?\nmarketing: Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me.\nindustrial designer: Five? Yeah, so maybe if \nuser interface: Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button, but now you don't have to put button, you have you just turn the turn the ball.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y you know \nuser interface: There's two kind of balls,\nmarketing: So you have \nuser interface: the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: But in the traditional controller, how do how can you control the scale?\nmarketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one.\nindustrial designer: You just push two button, zero and and one.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: And that's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah, yeah, y you you can do it, but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Are there some buttons? Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, this function is just for your browsing, from one channel to th the next one, the next s sn s, the th the third one.\nproject manager: It's not what you said previously.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Previously you said that turning this was the fine \nmarketing: Yeah, if you're changing your mind.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Fine to coarse.\nproject manager: Fine to coarse.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And from ten to ten channels here.\nuser interface: Y one to ten, ten to twelve, uh ten to t uh twenty. Ten to twenty and this one, t one two three four five six, like this.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh there's different scale, so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc\nmarketing: Okay. But this this has to stay on the table, right?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: This has to stay on the table.\nindustrial designer: In fact on a flat place \nuser interface: I i this is just a base. You can just \nindustrial designer: You can {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it \nproject manager: Oh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, no no, no. You can't put it out.\nindustrial designer: Oh ye yes, that's right.\nmarketing: Just It's \nproject manager: It's just your turning from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's impossible. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh\nproject manager: You need to put it on and turn. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point,\nuser interface: You use your y\nmarketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand.\nproject manager: Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control.\nindustrial designer: my God.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So th this is a d next generation controller. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nobody would take it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sure. Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah.\nproject manager: So nobody w will lost lose it.\nindustrial designer: yeah maybe, maybe may\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's the next prototype, maybe we cou\nuser interface: Okay okay, okay.\nproject manager: S maybe we can change from th\nindustrial designer: Four. Maybe four, it's okay.\nuser interface: Four. Okay.\nproject manager: Four? Easy to use, four.\nindustrial designer: I'll put four.\nproject manager: Gonna say four.\nmarketing: Four.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable.\nmarketing: Uh it's even easier to maybe.\nindustrial designer: You can you can erase with this er yeah.\nmarketing: Ok\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so.

{"fname": "product_test_148", "dialogue": "marketing: L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use?\nindustrial designer: Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it's might be easy. But it's just speaking.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's very easy.\nindustrial designer: You just need the command.\nuser interface: You can use this in this way.\nmarketing: Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: As a principle. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Please.\nuser interface: Th this is the base.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can turn to change the channel.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?\nuser interface: You just tu turn d d\nindustrial designer: I think maybe if you he\nproject manager: Oh, ok I understand.\nmarketing: Like if you want to go from \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You take take the remote, so \nindustrial designer: If you hear some click \nproject manager: and you can turn like that to change the channel? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but imagine you y\nproject manager: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping, but maybe it will be too fast. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from, I dunno, one to twenty?\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: How can you go directly to twenty, for example? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, no, no. I if y uh if \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: it depend on the the angle you turn the \nmarketing: Yeah. I agree. I agree.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y how you need to know I \nmarketing: But I mean if you're fro from two?\nuser interface: I if if this is a channel one. So it c it could be channel two, channel three, channel four, channel five.\nindustrial designer: I think something that Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, you have a, like that, and so on.\nuser interface: So change. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you you can \nmarketing: Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh \nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree.\nmarketing: We're not talking Yeah.\nuser interface: So you got how many degree you you it \nproject manager: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go \nindustrial designer: I think you can if you have a scale, so \nuser interface: No no, you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop, the the turn,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you \nmarketing: Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one?\nuser interface: It's it's very easy, because you kn you know how many channel are there in the \nmarketing: So you you count one degree, two degrees, no.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can do it.\nmarketing: I don't think so. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's a bit difficult.\nuser interface: I think so I think so you can do it. I think so, you can just change.\nindustrial designer: I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay, so \nmarketing: Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main \nuser interface: There's uh also a number, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah, but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So, when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty, so you can say channel twenty, or channel four, because you really want to go on this channel.\nindustrial designer: Uh, yeah, and y that's yeah.\nproject manager: But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.\nmarketing: And this would be more for browsing, ah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. To see uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah uh \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Seems to be good.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good choice, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I mean you're famous. You .\nindustrial designer: And but I'd \nuser interface: And also you can, if you i\nproject manager: yeah, what's what's this cherry?\nuser interface: You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this.\nindustrial designer: It is a turn off t turn off button, maybe.\nuser interface: For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two, you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's like fine, from coarse to fine.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: This is coarse, this is fine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah yeah. That's\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: So it's coarse to fine design.\nindustrial designer: that's very technologic, so. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah is is this is, from one channel to maybe to ten channel.\nindustrial designer: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates\nuser interface: This is from one channel to \nindustrial designer: maybe one of the \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, th you have the vocal commands.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's k \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: On off.\nindustrial designer: on off, yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but it has to be on to recognise fas\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, sleeping.\nmarketing: Ah, that's not the ecological part, yeah.\nproject manager: That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah.\nindustrial designer: To compensate .\nmarketing: Solar.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: So, which number?\nproject manager: three.\nindustrial designer: Easy to use, it's very relative but three it's fine, I think, it's reasonable three. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you agree?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Three?\nuser interface: Yeah, agree, agree.\nmarketing: So reasonably, is four, is one?\nindustrial designer: Three f three for me, it's o it's okay.\nmarketing: So, three.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And what's your opinion?\nindustrial designer: Will you give four?\nmarketing: Uh we wouldn't say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me.\nindustrial designer: Five? Yeah, so maybe if \nuser interface: Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button, but now you don't have to put button, you have you just turn the turn the ball.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but y you know \nuser interface: There's two kind of balls,\nmarketing: So you have \nuser interface: the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: But in the traditional controller, how do how can you control the scale?\nmarketing: Uh by pushing zero after after the first one.\nindustrial designer: You just push two button, zero and and one.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: And that's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah, yeah, y you you can do it, but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Are there some buttons? Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah, this function is just for your browsing, from one channel to th the next one, the next s sn s, the th the third one.\nproject manager: It's not what you said previously.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Previously you said that turning this was the fine \nmarketing: Yeah, if you're changing your mind.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Fine to coarse.\nproject manager: Fine to coarse.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And from ten to ten channels here.\nuser interface: Y one to ten, ten to twelve, uh ten to t uh twenty. Ten to twenty and this one, t one two three four five six, like this.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh there's different scale, so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc\nmarketing: Okay. But this this has to stay on the table, right?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: This has to stay on the table.\nindustrial designer: In fact on a flat place \nuser interface: I i this is just a base. You can just \nindustrial designer: You can {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it \nproject manager: Oh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, no no, no. You can't put it out.\nindustrial designer: Oh ye yes, that's right.\nmarketing: Just It's \nproject manager: It's just your turning from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's impossible. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh\nproject manager: You need to put it on and turn. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point,\nuser interface: You use your y\nmarketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand.\nproject manager: Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control.\nindustrial designer: my God.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So th this is a d next generation controller. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nobody would take it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sure. Yeah, you would never you would never lose this one, yeah.\nproject manager: So nobody w will lost lose it.\nindustrial designer: yeah maybe, maybe may\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's the next prototype, maybe we cou\nuser interface: Okay okay, okay.\nproject manager: S maybe we can change from th\nindustrial designer: Four. Maybe four, it's okay.\nuser interface: Four. Okay.\nproject manager: Four? Easy to use, four.\nindustrial designer: I'll put four.\nproject manager: Gonna say four.\nmarketing: Four.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable.\nmarketing: Uh it's even easier to maybe.\nindustrial designer: You can you can erase with this er yeah.\nmarketing: Ok\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, four it's more reasonable, so. So it's nine,\nmarketing: So, average?\nindustrial designer: nine over three.\nuser interface: Three?\nmarketing: Three?\nproject manager: Trois.

Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah.

Oh.\nmarketing: just imagine we have \nindustrial designer: So \nuser interface: We have to delete the the sample sensor, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, but we have you the the voice recognition,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: no?\nmarketing: Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really \nuser interface: Yeah it's the one it's \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: m maybe we ha we have two versions, the first version, the basic version.\nindustrial designer: I think you can transform the wood into plastic, maybe.\nuser interface: Advanced version we have speak.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Because uh it seems that this can be \nmarketing: Yeah, if \nproject manager: Or it would be better.\nindustrial designer: yeah, wood into plastic and it it should be fine.\nuser interface: Plastic is free. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, do we need special colour?\nmarketing: Yeah, that's one of the requirement.\nproject manager: Because we have red.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, red and yellow.\nproject manager: Red and yellow.\nuser interface: Wait.\nindustrial designer: Fancy.\nuser interface: We we can we can we c {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black.\nuser interface: yellow.\nmarketing: Black then is a regular colour, so.\nproject manager: I think so we need if we try to have a kind of\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Yeah, one.\nproject manager: pineapple bee. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. So push button then it's it's the next expensive one.\nproject manager: Yeah. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. And I think this is one. Integrated scroll wheel push button\nmarketing: Yeah, thi this might be.\nproject manager:. So we'll we have only one? And push button.\nmarketing: Close to.\nproject manager: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button, it's uh \nindustrial designer: One. I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons, so we can just, I dunno, try to modify some of them to have yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, so what's the bottleneck?\nuser interface: How about we change the sale?\nmarketing: Double curved.\nindustrial designer: Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah.\nproject manager: Something flat.\nindustrial designer: F some \nmarketing: Yeah, but flat \nproject manager: S uncurved. Yeah, maybe not.\nindustrial designer: Single curve .\nmarketing: Case, what's the ca\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Single curve should be fine, so. Oh, what {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm. Nearly.\nuser interface: Ah we have one {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And then one Euro left.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um.\nproject manager: Maybe don't bat no battery, only solar cells.\nindustrial designer: It's it's a bad idea, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: I think there's a problem with the push push button. We only need maybe just one.\nindustrial designer: Two?\nproject manager: Just one.\nindustrial designer: One. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's fine. That's fine. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.

It I th it's fine.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: It's good they're not charging anything for that. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, yeah. It think we we've done good job, as the cost is\nuser interface: Cou could we have look \nproject manager: twelve fifty e\nuser interface: Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost?\nmarketing: Yeah y actually it's wrong. We're not under twelve Euros and a half.\nproject manager: Yeah, but it's under or equal. It's not written. Sometimes it's under or equal.\nindustrial designer: It's fine. It's under or equal. It's fine, so \nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. So let's say \nproject manager: Twelve fifty.\nuser interface: Wha what \nindustrial designer: It's fine, twelve fifty uh \nuser interface: yeah. Which part is the most expensive part? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Solar cells.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think.\nindustrial designer: The solar cells, r is i is it?\nuser interface: Yeah, I think it's not t t\nproject manager: I think, yeah. But it would i be interesting for our marketing team, to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be \nindustrial designer: Yeah, to be able to si to sell it.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Cheaper.\nmarketing: That's nice argument,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, with mi\nmarketing: but if it's it's still four our of twelve.\nindustrial designer: It's it is really really uh really very very expensive, though.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe if uh okay.\nproject manager: Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative, so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but we just have one button. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's easy to use and powerful, as the remote control a has only one button.\nmarketing: Easy. I don't know about powerful. Yeah.\nproject manager: Easy, powerful.\nindustrial designer: It's easy to use. It's very easy to use. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product.\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Uh that's what we've just done.\nindustrial designer: We've done it with it is under the if it was low, high or so.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Um okay.\nproject manager: Now \nindustrial designer: So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation?\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Well I think we have just have to discuss if \nindustrial designer: Okay, okay, it's fine.\nmarketing: I dunno.\nproject manager: So did you enjoy your clay modelling?\nuser interface: Yes. Of course. This is my job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah? Was it a nice way to create your remote control?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it's uh it's good, to to create a control instead of a computer. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end. And designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And for the marketing guy?\nmarketing: Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards, so it um.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay.\nproject manager: And new ideas about new products, maybe, wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yellow. I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It can be an interesting I don't know \nproject manager: Yes, just lemon.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon.\nuser interface: Yeah, but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um \nindustrial designer: It's flat, uh \nuser interface: Yeah yeah it's flat,\nproject manager: Squared?\nuser interface: yeah the shape is very boring.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's right. It's really boring, yeah.\nuser interface: Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So you can you have base, triangle base so you the T_V_ you can \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah, the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's that would be really interesting, actually.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Because the T_V_ you also \nproject manager: Oh, that's interesting. You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things. Electronic device.\nindustrial designer: Device devi\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, but just don't trust too much the trends.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The fruit? Yeah.\nproject manager: Maybe \nmarketing: 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe la next year it will be insects.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's \nmarketing: Maybe two years it's dead.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after, you know, if the people change their mind you change also the product.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long long life product.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: T_V_ is more like fifteen years, maybe, so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. That's a yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for\nindustrial designer: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones, you know.\nmarketing: fifteen years \nproject manager: Customable T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, you customise it every ti so every ti if people change, you just change the appearance, and y y you can keep \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Ah such yeah. You've already said mobile phones.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Tha that would that would make it. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, you can keep the global appearan\nproject manager: Yeah, and following \nindustrial designer: The mood of persons, the fashions uh \nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's interesting, maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr\nindustrial designer: We int Yeah, T_V_, yeah. A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter, you know, so it's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So what i and do w is it Okay.\nproject manager: So I think the costs are within the budget. We're just at twelve fifty Euros.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, the pr at \nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: do you think you can celebrate your creation?\nuser interface: And you can celebrate your leadership. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh, thanks a lot. Thank you, mister David Jordan. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object.
