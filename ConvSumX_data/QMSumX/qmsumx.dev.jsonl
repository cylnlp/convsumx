{"fname": "academic_dev_18", "dialogue": "grad a: OK, we 're on.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: So, I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items, three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today. So. The uh first was transcription status. Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is?\nphd f: Um, sort of, I do, peripherally.\nphd c: Is that English?\nphd f: Um Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago\nphd d: That's our system.\ngrad a: Ugh!\nphd f: and that it's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that.\ngrad a: C can I have a pen?\nphd f: Um Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side. She's assigned, I think probably five or six m more meetings.\nphd c: Yeah, I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something.\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd f: Yeah, so um, I guess she's hired some new transcribers\nphd d: Speaking \ngrad e: Which meetings is she transcribing?\nphd f: and Um well we 've we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um, sort of awaiting to go to IBM.\ngrad e: OK.\nphd c: For IBM, yeah.\nphd d: Hmm.\ngrad e: OK.\nphd f: and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here.\nphd d: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from IBM\ngrad e: So we 're doing some in parallel.\ngrad a: Yep.\nphd f: No.\ngrad a: No, no.\nphd f: Oh no no.\ngrad a: We haven't done that process.\nphd d: no?\nphd f: No. We 're not waiting on them.\ngrad a: So. They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process.\nphd d: Oh. Oh, OK.\ngrad e: So they 're just doing their own thing until \nphd f: Yeah.\nphd d: Because I I need to ask Jane whether it's it would be OK for her um, s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection, which is these short like five or seven minute sessions.\nphd f: We 're doing it in parallel, yeah.\ngrad e: OK.\nphd c: Yep.\nphd d: Um and we want it You know, we need The Again, we we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich\ngrad a: Right.\nphd d: and get it transcribed and get it back. But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started.\ngrad a: Yep, sounds familiar.\nphd d: And so um I wanted to ask Jane if if uh, you know, maybe one of their transcribers could could do I mean since these are very short, that should really be uh,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: um It's \nphd c: There's only two channels. So it's only Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think.\nphd d: It's only two Right, s\nphd c: So.\nphd d: Yeah. So So it's basically one channel to transcribe. And it's One session is only uh like seven \nprofessor b: So that should have ma many fewer And it's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that,\nphd d: Right. And some of it is read speech, so we could give them the the thing that they 're reading\nprofessor b: right? So. Yeah.\nphd d: and they just may \ngrad a: Make sure it's right.\nphd c: Yep.\nphd d: And so um, um, I guess since she's I was gonna ask her but since she's not around I maybe I 'll \nprofessor b: Yeah, well it certainly seems \nphd d: Uh if if that's OK with you to to, you know, get that stuff uh to ask her for that, then I 'll do that.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah, if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that, that's OK because I I um, I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us, so it's \nphd d: Yeah. OK, yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Alrighty.\nphd f: Oh, yeah, and also related to the transcription stuff, so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in, in terms of whether it's \ngrad a: Can you mail that out to the list?\nphd f: Mm - hmm, yeah I will. I That's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages\ngrad a: Oh, OK, OK.\nphd f: and so that's where I 'm putting it but I 'll I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it.\ngrad a: Yeah, I haven't done that. So. I have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory.\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad a: I 'll try to get to that. OK. So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval, but I don't really think there's much to talk about. I 'm just gonna do it. And uh, if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead.\nprofessor b: You are going to \ngrad a: I 'm gonna send out to the participants, uh, with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits. And then bleep them out.\nprofessor b: OK.\ngrad a: For the ones that we have. Um \nphd c: So but it's just transcripts, not the not the audio?\ngrad a: Nope, they 'll have access to the audio also.\nphd c: OK, yeah, yep. Ah.\ngrad a: I mean that's my intention. Because the transcripts might not be right.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: So \ngrad a: So you want people to be able to listen to them.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: So, um the audio that they 're gonna have access to, will that be the uncompressed version? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and \ngrad a: Oh, that's a good point. That's a good point. Yeah, it's it's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because, uh, uh, it takes too long to do random access decompression.\nphd f: Hmm. Yeah, I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on\ngrad a: Well, that was the other point.\nphd f: Oh, was that another one?\ngrad a: Yep, that's another agenda item.\nphd f: OK. I 'll wait.\ngrad a: So, uh But that is a good point so we 'll get to that, too. Um, DARPA demo status, not much to say. The back - end stuff is working out fine. It's more or less ready to go. I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR, EDU, et cetera and also by the user ID. So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well. Uh The back - end is uh, going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer. And uh Dave Gelbart says he's a little too busy. So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and and you and I can just talk about it off - line more.\ngrad e: Right.\ngrad a: But uh the back - end was pretty smooth.\nprofessor b: Oh\ngrad a: So I think, we 'll have something. It may not be as As pretty as we might like, but we 'll have something.\nprofessor b: I wondered whe when we would reach Dave's saturation point. He's sort of been been volunteering for everything\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and and uh \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: O K. Finally said he was too busy. I guess we reached it.\ngrad a: Yeah, he he actually he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it. So. Oh well. Um \ngrad e: And, also um, I was just showing Andreas, I got um an X Waves kind of display, and I don't know how much more we can do with it with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom\ngrad a: Oh, cool.\ngrad e: so, right now it's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know, it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it think it has potential for a little something,\ngrad a: For a demo?\ngrad e: yeah, for a demo.\ngrad a: Yeah, sounds good.\ngrad e: So \nprofessor b: OK, so again, the issue is For July, the issue's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine, uh, and so on, but \ngrad e: Oh. OK.\ngrad a: So it might just be slides.\ngrad e: Yeah, OK.\nphd c: Well  Yeah.\ngrad e: Well, we 'll see, um \nphd c: I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart's PC and it worked just fine. So hopefully that will work.\nphd d: Really? So is that Because there's some people um It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at at SRI\nphd c: Yeah. Yep.\nphd d: because the um \ngrad a: Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK, very generic with Snack,\nphd d: we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the \nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad a: so basically anything you can get Snack to run on, it will work.\nphd d: Right.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah but But the problem is the version Transcriber works with, the Snack version, is one point six whatever and that's not anymore supported. It's not on on the web page anymore. But I just wrote an email to to the author of to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library\ngrad a: Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber?\nphd c: and so it works. Yeah, but then you can't add our patches and then the the new version is is totally different\ngrad a: Oh.\nphd c: a and in yeah, in terms of of the source code.\ngrad a: Ah.\nphd c: You you can't find the Tcl files anymore. It's some whatever wrapped thing\nphd d: Mmm.\nphd c: and you can't you can't access that so you have to install First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches.\ngrad a: Patch. Ugh!\nphd d: I I wonder if if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along \nphd c: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad a: We have Yeah b it's just hasn't made it into the release yet.\nphd d: We have? Oh. Oh, OK.\nphd f: So did you um put the uh the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page? Or \nphd c: No, I haven't done that yet. I 'm oh Nope. But I definitely will do that.\nprofessor b: So, can some of the stuff that Don's talking about somehow fit into this Uh, mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the \ngrad e: Yeah.\nphd c: So \ngrad e: Yeah, it's basically ASCII files or binary files, whatever representation. Just three different It's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's \nphd d: So So Well \ngrad e: I mean we could do it in Matl - I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure.\nphd d: But But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the you know, maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform.\nphd c: Yep.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yes.\ngrad e: Yeah, that 'd be very cool.\ngrad a: It 'd be easy enough to add that. Again it's it's It's more Tcl - T\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad a: So someone who's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it,\nphd d: Right.\ngrad a: but uh, it wouldn't be hard to do.\nphd d: Right. But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed.\ngrad a: Yep.\nphd c: Yep.\nphd d: S\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Right.\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah, maybe we could l look into that.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad a: But it it seems to me that I c\nphd c: And \ngrad a: It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary. So yo It seems to me you could do images.\ngrad e: Um What do you mean by real time? Do you mean like \nphd f: Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad a: Yeah, jus Yeah.\nphd f: Is that what you mean?\ngrad a: It just seems to me jus\ngrad e: It would be cool to see it \nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad e: It would be cool like to see to hear it and see it,\nphd c: And to hear it. Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad e: and see the pitch contours also.\ngrad a: Sure, but I don't think I You can do all that just statically in\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad e: I think it would lose Yeah, I mean y\ngrad a: Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that's \ngrad e: Right, right. I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just like um view graphs or something.\nprofessor b: You know, wh Yeah. So. Uh, no, we 're talking about on the computer and and um, I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting,\ngrad e: Right.\nprofessor b: we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and, the more live, the better, but uh, given the crunch of time, we may have to retreat from it to some extent. So I think  For a lot of reasons, I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: so it 'd be a good thing to get in there. But, um Anyway, jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing, uh, in  to people.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Cuz a lot of this stuff, particularly for Communicator, uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them.\nphd d: Mmm.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again. So, we 're doing OK on backed up. We 're We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk. So, uh, we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical, but we are like ninety five percent, ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad a: And, my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space, but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once, in a lot of different ways.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: Oh there's a lot of transcribers, too.\ngrad a: Yeah, there 're a lot of transcribers,\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad a: so all of those need to be expanded, and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh, uh, uh, the permission forms,\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: An\nphd f: Right.\ngrad a: so I want those to be live, so there's a lot of data that has to be around. Um And Jane was gonna talk to, uh, Dave Johnson about it. One of the things I was thinking is we we just got these hundred alright, excuse me ten, uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades.\nprofessor b: Did they come in?\nphd f: SUN - Blades.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd f: Yeah. They came in the other day.\ngrad a: They came in but they 're not set up yet.\nprofessor b: Oh.\ngrad a: And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room, they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines. And if we just need un - backed - up space, we could just hang disks off them.\nphd f: Well, is there Why not just hang them off of Abbott, is there a \ngrad a: Because there's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd f: Ah.\nprofessor b: Weren't we gonna get \nphd f: Ah, I see.\nprofessor b: Well, maybe it should get another rack.\nphd d: But you still need to store the disks somehow.\ngrad a: Well, but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays.\nphd d: So \ngrad a: Just put them in.\nphd f: You can put two \nphd d: Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the \ngrad a: Sure.\nphd c: Internal. Yeah.\ngrad a: Yeah. Cuz the SUN uh, these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives.\nphd d: Oh.\ngrad a: So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it, uh, a second disk rack or something.\nphd d: Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh, file server.\ngrad a: Well, I mean there are lots of long term solutions. What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting?\nphd c: Yep.\nphd d: I see Oh, I see.\nprofessor b: Well, for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten, mightn't you? Uh, you know Dave Johnson is gone for, like, ten days,\ngrad a: Oh, I didn't know he had left already.\nprofessor b: Uh, well, tonight.\ngrad a: Oh, oh well.\nphd d: You mean he won't set up the mmm.\nprofessor b: I don't know.\ngrad e: How much space do you need for these?\nprofessor b: I don't know what his schedule is.\ngrad a: You we need about a gig per meeting.\nprofessor b: I 'm just saying he's gone.\nphd c: Yep.\nphd f: I I thi\ngrad e: I have um I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer.\ngrad a: Alright! What's your computer's name?\ngrad e: So Uh, Samosa.\nprofessor b: You had an eighteen gigabyte drive.\ngrad e: Yeah, I had. Well it's about I think there's about twelve gig left.\ngrad a: So it And you have an X drives installed? OK.\ngrad e: Yeah. So, I didn't realize it was so critical.\ngrad a: And you 're o you 're offering?\ngrad e: I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything.\ngrad a: OK.\ngrad e: Um not that I can't do anything, I jus\nphd f: I I jus I just gave Thilo some about ten gigs, the last ten gigs of space that there was on on uh Abbott. Uh And uh So but that But \ngrad a: Which one was that, X G? X G?\nphd c: XG.\nphd f: XG.\ngrad a: OK.\nphd d: XG?\nphd f: Yeah.\nphd d: That's also where we store the The uh Hub - five training set waveforms,\nphd c: Oops.\ngrad a: But that won't be getting any bigger,\nphd d: right?\nphd f: No.\ngrad a: will it?\nphd f: I don't think that's on XG.\nphd d: Right.\nphd f: On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane's disk.\nphd c: It's Yeah.\nphd d: But I 've also been storing I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are\ngrad e: Well \nphd d: and we won't be using the old ones anymore.\ngrad e: I have a lot of space, though.\nphd f: Yeah, I do I don't think it was on XG.\nphd d: Uh Oh thats XA Oh that's X \nphd c: Isn't that XH?\nphd f: I th\ngrad a: Not not for long.\ngrad e: I have a lot of space and it's not it's n There's very little uh Yeah not for long.\nphd d: Maybe I 'm confu\ngrad e: But I mean it's not going f\nphd d: Oh no I 'm sorry.\ngrad e: It's not being used often at all.\nphd c: But I 'm using XH H, too.\ngrad a: Yeah, it's probably Probably only about four gig is on X on your X drive,\nphd c: So.\nphd d: Oh OK.\ngrad a: but we 'll definitely take it up if you \ngrad e: I th\nphd d: I think you 're right. It's XH and D \ngrad e: I think it's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there,\nphd d: The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused.\ngrad e: three or four meetings.\nphd d: OK.\ngrad a: Great.\ngrad e: So.\ngrad a: OK, so that will get us through the next couple days.\nprofessor b: We need We need another gigaquad.\ngrad a: Yep. At least.\nprofessor b: There should I d There should just be a b I should have a button.\ngrad a: The \" more disk space \" button?\nprofessor b: Just press Press each meeting saying \" we need more disk space \" \" this week \".\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor b: Skip the rest of the conversation.\nphd f: Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings.\nprofessor b: And And how much does each meeting take?\nphd f: And it's about a gig uncompressed.\nphd c: It's It's a little bit more as I usually don't do not uncompress the all of the PZM and the PDA things.\nphd f: Is a little more?\nphd c: So.\nphd f: Right, yeah so if you uncompressed everything it's even more.\nphd c: It's Yeah. One point five or something.\nphd f: U Uh compressed how much are they? Like \ngrad a: Half a gig. For all of them.\nphd f: About half?\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. Yep.\nphd f: So we 're definitely are storing you know, all of those. So there's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far?\nprofessor b: So - so So maybe there's a hundred gig or something. Or I mean. Cuz we we have the uncompressed around also.\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Right.\nprofessor b: So it's like \nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: Right. Well we We haven't uncompressed all the meetings, but \ngrad a: I would like to.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well I mean it's the they really are cheap. I mean it's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them,\ngrad a: Yep.\nphd f: Right.\nprofessor b: but But uh, we could You know, if you want to get four disks, get four disks. I mean it's it's small I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars.\nphd f: Yeah. Well I sent that message out to, I guess, you and Dave asking for if we could get some disk.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd f: I s I sent this out a a day ago\ngrad a: And put it where?\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd f: but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works. I mean does he just go out and get them and if it's OK, and \ngrad a: Yep.\nphd f: So I was assuming he was gonna take over that. But he's probably too busy given that he's leaving.\nprofessor b: Yeah, I think you need a direct conversation with him. And just say an - e just ask him that, you know, wha what should you do. And in my answer back was \" are you sure you just want one? \" So I mean I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure \" well, here's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months \".\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad a: Wa - a I know what they want. The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine. So they don't want to stack up external drives.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: Um  And then they want everything else in the machine room.\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad a: So the question is where are you gonna hang them?\nphd f: Mm - hmm. I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room.\ngrad a: Right.\nphd f: So.\nprofessor b: Right. So this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave,\nphd d: Th - The \nphd f: I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now.\nprofessor b: cuz it \nphd d: One Mmm.\ngrad a: Yep.\nphd d: One One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is\nphd f: So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff.\nphd d: I bet there are still some old, uh, like, nine gig disks, uh, around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and and you know recover the space.\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor b: Yeah. No. I think Dave Dave knows all these things, of course. An - and so, he always has a a lot of plans of things that he's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time.\nphd d: Right. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: But I I know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk. And so I think what he's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system, rather than on new disk.\nphd d: Mmm. Mmm.\ngrad a: So. Which \nprofessor b: Well. So. But this this is a very specific question for me. Basically, we can easily get one to four disks, I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it, it's no big deal. Uh, but the question is where they go, and I don't think we can solve that here, you just have to ask him.\nphd d: Maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there.\ngrad a: Yeah really.\nprofessor b: Attach to \ngrad a: Popcorn.\nprofessor b: Yeah?\nphd d: To the machine that collects the data. So then you could, at least temporarily, store stuff there.\ngrad a: Yeah, it's just It's not on the net, so it's a little awkward\nphd d: The only \nphd f: Hmm.\nphd d: What do you mean it's not on the net?\ngrad a: It's not \nphd c: It's not bad.\ngrad a: It's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S\nphd d: Oh because it's because it's an ACIRI machine?\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Oh, oh oh.\ngrad a: And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net, but Who knows when that will happen?\nphd d: But that can't be that hard.\nphd f: That might be a good short term solution, though.\nphd d: I mean \ngrad a: No, the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers.\nphd d: Oh,\ngrad a: So, they actually have to run a wire somewhere.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah, e again, you know, any one of these things is certainly not a big deal. If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's it's jus every ever everybody everybody has a has \ngrad a: But Dave has to do all of them.\nprofessor b: Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing. But at any rate I think that there's a there's a longer term thing and there's immediate need and I think we need a a conversation with Uh, maybe maybe after after tea or something you and I can go down and and talk to him about it Just say \" wha you know, what should we do right now? \"\nphd f: How long is David gonna be gone?\nprofessor b: Uh, eleven days or something?\ngrad a: Oh my!\nprofessor b: Yeah basically tomorrow and all of the week after.\ngrad a: And that's all I have.\nprofessor b: Um Let's see. The only oth thing other thing I was gonna add was that um uh, I talked briefly to Mari and uh we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next. And I I I wanted to make it, um after the next one of these meetings, so something that we wanna do next meeting is is uh to put together um, a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it, um, that we 've done. I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can I can dream up text but this is basically gonna lead to the annual report. So Um If w\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: This is the fifteenth? So just a week from tomorrow?\nprofessor b: Um, that would\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, we can This So that's an \nphd d: Is this gotta be in the morning?\nprofessor b: Um \nphd d: Or Because you know I Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two. So if it could be before that would be be\nprofessor b: No, no but I I I don't need other folks for the meeting. I can do it. A A All I 'm saying is that on \nphd d: Oh, OK, alright. Oh I 'm sorry, I misunderstood.\nprofessor b: Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting if I wa something I I I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her.\nphd d: I thought you are OK. Alright. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I think I have a pretty good idea\nphd d: OK.\nprofessor b: but but um Uh, and then the next day uh, late in the day I 'll be having that that discussion with her.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: Um. So.\nphd d: Um Uh One thing I mean we in past meetings we had um also a you know various variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically. So. Um. And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting and between you know, whoever's interested in that because I feel that uh there's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh \nprofessor b: Think so?\nphd d: Well, it's that It's just gonna be ver very boring for people who are not you know, sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system.\ngrad a: I 'm interested.\nprofessor b: Well, OK, so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition?\nphd c: Me too.\nphd f: Jane may not be.\ngrad a: Jane, I think.\nphd c: Yep.\nphd d: Well I know Well, Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this \ngrad a: No. If we talked about it in this meeting.\nphd f: He's wondering how much overlap there will be.\nprofessor b: Yeah, so you 're su\nphd d: OK.\nprofessor b: So.\nphd d: So, uh, uh, Liz and Jane probably.\nprofessor b: OK, so we 're gonna have a guy's meeting.\nphd d: Uh. Uh, if you wanna put it that way.\nphd f: Good thing Liz isn't here.\nprofessor b: Real \ngrad e: Watch a ball game?\nprofessor b: Yeah, real real real men \" Real men do decoding \" or something like that.\nphd f: Don't listen to this, Liz.\nphd d: Right.\nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd d: I mean it it's sort of I mean when when the talk is about data collection stuff, sometimes I 've you know, I I 'm bored.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: The Nod off?\nphd d: So it's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to i to to be uh you know If I cou you know this could \nprofessor b: It's cuz y you have a So you need a better developed feminine side.\nphd d: I 'm\nprofessor b: There's probably gonna be a lot of \" bleeps \" in this meeting.\nphd d: not sure I wanna \ngrad a: Yeah, I would as I would guess.\nprofessor b: Uh. Um.\nphd d: Yeah and \nprofessor b: I think it must be uh nearing the end of the week. Um. Yeah. I You know, I I 've heard some comments about like this. That m could be.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean the Um. U\nphd d: And we don't have to do it every week.\nphd f: Could we \nphd d: We could do it every other week or so. You know, whatev or whenever we feel like we \nphd f: Right, I was Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week?\ngrad a: Or just alternate the focus.\nphd f: Tha - That's what I mean.\ngrad a: Yeah, so on even weeks have basic on data.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: We could do that, yeah.\nphd f: Yeah.\nphd d: I I Personally I 'd I 'm not in favor of more meetings. Um. Because, uh.\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad a: I am.\nphd d: You know.\ngrad a: Oh sor\nphd f: But I do I don't I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder.\nphd d: Right.\ngrad a: Well, except that we keep going for our full time.\nphd f: So if we did that \nphd c: Yep.\nphd f: Well, cuz we get into these other topics.\ngrad a: Yeah.\nphd d: We feel We feel obligated to collect more data.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad a: Ugh.\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad a: I don't.\nphd f: So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting \ngrad a: Let's read digits and go.\nprofessor b: Why don't we just start with that.\nphd d: ummh. ummh. OK.\nprofessor b: And then if we find, you know we 're just not getting enough done, there's all these topics not coming up, then we can expand into another meeting.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But I I think that's a great idea. Uh. So uh. Um. Let's chat about it with Liz and Jane when we get a chance, see what they think and \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: Yeah that would be good. I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: and there's lots of things, you know, details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd you know, where do we go from here kind of things and So, it would be good.\nprofessor b: Yeah, and you 're you 're attending the uh the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best you and I, I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two.\ngrad a: Bridge.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: We are doing recognition in both of them. So.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Right.\nprofessor b: Uh.\ngrad a: OK?\nphd d: So um. So so we could talk a little bit about that now if if there's some time.\ngrad a: No, no that would be for next week.\nphd d: Um I jus So the latest result was that um um yot I tested the uh the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for for this year's Hub - five test set.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And the recognition performance was exactly, and I mean exactly up to the you know, the first decimal, same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end.\ngrad a: Mmm.\nphd f: For both females and males?\nphd d: Yes. Uh, well i there was a little bit of a \nphd f: Oh!\nphd d: i overall. They They were The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: I mean definitely not significant.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement.\ngrad a: Wow. Just with ROVER?\nphd d: So. t With N - best ROVER, which is like our new and improved version of ROVER.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm, uh c combine that.\nprofessor b: So except I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd d: And, the \nphd f: But a percent and a half?\ngrad a: Yeah, it's pretty impressive.\nphd f: That's \nphd d: And And so uh after I told the my uh colleagues at SRI about that, you know, now they definitely want to, you know, uh, have a Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh, you know, basically a at least the system combination. Um, and, you know, why not?\nprofessor b: Sure, why not?\nphd d: Uh. So.\ngrad a: We clearly gotta add a few more features, though.\nphd d: Uh w what do you mean? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles?\ngrad a: No, uh front - end features. You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra. Let's, you know, try RASTA and MSG, and \nphd d: Oh I mean Yeah. Well Right. So, we cou Yeah. That's the the the There's one thing uh I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end You know, if you you know you basically multiply your effort by N, where N is a number of different systems\nphd f: Oh.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: and Um. So. So one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that's a fairly painless um thing.\nprofessor b: Mmm. An\nphd d: So.\nphd f: Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh \nphd d: I I think so. Yeah. Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if You know, maybe it's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: So. Um Jus - You know, just wanted to let you know that that's working out very nicely.\ngrad a: Cool.\nphd d: And then we had some results on digits, uh, with um We We So this was uh really  really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And so, uh. But as a result, um, you know, we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd d: And the reason is basically there's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set.\ngrad a: Right.\nprofessor b: Including digits I gather, yeah.\nphd d: And you c And Not all of No it's actually, digits is only a maybe a fifth of it.\nprofessor b: A fifth of it is how much?\nphd d: The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that.\nprofessor b: Right. But a fi a fifth is how much?\nphd d: A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something.\nprofessor b: Yeah, so I mean that's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was.\nphd d: Right.\nprofessor b: So.\nphd d: But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there\nprofessor b: Oh yeah\nphd d: because we 're doing \nprofessor b: w\nphd d: You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT  uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: which is only what two hours something?\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad a: I don't know.\nphd d: So. Uh, more read speech data definitely helps. And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty.\nprofessor b: Yeah that was the interesting thing.\nphd d: That's e\nprofessor b: Because because uh, it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better,\nphd d: That was e Right, right.\nprofessor b: but but uh.\nphd d: Right.\nphd f: Well is there even more read speech data around?\nphd d: Oh, yeah. So we only for the Hub - five training, we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone database.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Um, so, you could beef that up and probably do even better.\ngrad a: I could also put in uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News, which is mostly prepared speech.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: It's not exactly read speech but it's pretty darn close.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Well, I mean that's plenty of read speech data. I mean, Wall Street Journal, uh, take one example.\ngrad a: Yeah. That's right.\nphd d: But um. So, you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than TI - digits.\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Well they been using TIMIT.\nphd d: OK.\nprofessor b: That Uh. They they uh they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and and uh, um, and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT.\ngrad a: Hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh But uh which So that's what they 're they 're using now.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: But but yeah certainly if we, um If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was. I mean there's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Once we know, then the trainable parts of it it 'd be great to run lots of lots of stuff through.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Right. Well, that was that. And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system and You wanna You wanna see where that stands?\nphd f: Well, I 'm \nphd d: \nphd f: Yeah, so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses. And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with. And uh so then I 'll train the net. And.\nphd d: An - And one side effect of that would be that it's um that the phone set would change. So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight \nphd f: Right. Eight.\nphd d: forty - eight phones?\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we 've been using so far.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: And that that that will probably help, actually,\nphd f: So it's a little different?\nphd d: because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the as far as just the um, um Just You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features. And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three. And so, you know, fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view.\nprofessor b: Sure. Although we I mean, it's not that many fewer and and and we take a KLT anyway so we could \nphd d: Right. Exactly.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: So so that was the other thing. And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end. So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions.\nprofessor b: Yeah, and I think and we sh again check we should check with Stephane. My impression was that when we did that before that had very little uh he didn't lose very much.\nphd d: Right.\nphd f: By just taking the top whatever?\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor b: Yeah yeah.\nphd d: But then And then something Once we have the new M L P trained up, uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know, those features uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know, the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system.\nprofessor b: And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system.\nphd d: Exactly.\nphd f: Right.\nphd d: Yeah. So that would basically give us a, um, more hopefully a a better system\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: um because you know, compared to what Eric did a while ago, where he trained up, I think, a system based on Broadcast News and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard or s uh and \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: But he I think he d he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available. And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as as the as ours is.\nprofessor b: That's That's certainly one thing, yeah.\nphd d: So.\nprofessor b: Uh. Yeah.\nphd d: And the dictionary made a huge difference. Uh. We we made some improvements to the dictionary's uh to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard, which \nprofessor b: Well the other thing is, dipping deep into history and into uh our resource management days, when we were collaborating with SRI before,\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Mmm.\nprofessor b: uh it was I think, it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher, uh at the time.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh. And. Later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems\nphd f: Yeah.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: cuz they were self consistent but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate. Uh. But that was a that was a good good good way to start.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: And we 're not quite that bad with our our Switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as SRI's,\nphd d: OK. Yeah.\nprofessor b: so \nphd d: Right.\nphd f: W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done? Roughly?\nprofessor b: Well, the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent error. And uh it was I think there's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for. We never did really fix up the dictionary. Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did.\nphd d: Yeah. Mmm.\nprofessor b: Uh, we never did an never did any adaptation\nphd d: But that w Even that that number \nprofessor b: uh, we never did any \nphd d: Right. And And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data, right? Where the error rate now is in the twenties.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd d: So, um.\nprofessor b: So we were Yeah. We were probably at least a factor or two off.\nphd d: That's yet s Right.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: So it would be So it would be good t to sort of r re uh \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do.\nprofessor b: Yeah. But I think again it's Yeah. It's the conver it's the s conversational speech bit. Because our our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: He knows.\nphd d: Right. And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up. Right? Because it's a pretty good um indicator of that.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: So it's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs before we go ahead and train up the uh you know, use them as a basis for the tandem system.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah. It 'll still probably be worse. I mean, it's it 'd be context independent and so on.\nphd d: No. Sure. Not \nphd f: Should we Should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training?\nprofessor b: But.\nphd d: But \nphd f: I mean should should we even use that?\nphd d: Oh oh that's a good question.\nphd f: Or should I just go straight to \nphd d: Yeah, we we weren't sure whether it's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign.\ngrad a: Try it. You run it? Keep keep both versions? See which one's better?\nprofessor b: Uh, yeah. I mean. I think I agree with Ad I mean basically you would then You proceed with the embedded training.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: It's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Right.\nprofessor b: And while it's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did.\nphd d: OK. Alright.\nphd f: Mmm.\ngrad a: I could make arguments either way. You know, it's \nphd d: But But so I \ngrad a: Sort of given up guessing.\nphd d: Well but i But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training? Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got\nprofessor b: Uh well. It depended on the task. I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important\nphd d: Right.\nprofessor b: because we 're coming from uh, alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system.\nphd d: That are from another Right.\ngrad a: Although, I mean we 've done it with When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net, embedded training made it worse.\nphd d: Right.\nprofessor b: Uh.\ngrad a: Which I 've never figured out.\nprofessor b: Right. But I mean i\ngrad a: I think it's a bug.\nphd d: So you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system?\ngrad a: Yep.\nphd d: And then Uh.\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Hmm. Well, that might probably just Hmm. That was probably because your initial system I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge's. And you Um.\nprofessor b: Was it? I don't think it was.\ngrad a: No they were they were comparable.\nphd d: It wasn't?\nprofessor b: No.\ngrad a: They were very close.\nphd d: Really?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: That's weird.\nprofessor b: Excuse me?\nphd d: That's That's weird.\ngrad a: That's what I said.\nprofessor b: Oh!\nphd d: No I mean it's weird that it did I 'm sorry. It's w It's weird that it got worse.\nphd f: That's ambiguous.\nprofessor b: Um. No. Uh. Tha - u we we 've see I mean and wi with the numbers OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better.\nphd d: Oh actually it's not that weird because we have seen We have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better.\nprofessor b: Yeah. It just \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: But I But I would I would suspect that something that that had um a very different Um feature set, for instance I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us.\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor b: I I would expect that something that had a different feature set would would uh benefit from \nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: What about uh hidden unit size on this.\nprofessor b: Oh, wait a minute, and the other thing uh,\nphd f: Oh.\nprofessor b: sorry, it was the other thing is that what was in common to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors.\ngrad a: Right. Ah yeah.\nprofessor b: So I mean, uh, that's another pretty big difference\ngrad a: That's another big difference.\nprofessor b: and uh, one bac at least Back at \nphd d: You mean with soft targets? Or? Sorry, I 'm sor I missed What What's the key issue here?\nprofessor b: Oh, that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors. And if we 're we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system, it's a likelihood - based system. So so that's another difference.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I mean. You know, there's diffe different front - end different different uh, um, training criterion Uh, I would think that in a that an embedded uh embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But we don't know.\nphd d: OK.\nprofessor b: You gonna say something?\nphd f: Yeah. I was wondering uh you know what size net I should Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions?\nprofessor b: Uh, how much training data?\nphd f: Well, I was gonna start off with the small train set.\nprofessor b: And how How many hours is that?\nphd f: That's why I was I I 'm not sure how much that is.\nphd d: Uh, I think that has about Well i you 'd would be gender - dependent training, right? So So I think it's uh that's about mmm, something like thirty hours.\nphd f: Gender - dependent, yeah.\nphd d: Thirty hours per gender.\nphd f: Thirty hours.\ngrad a: I 'm not sure what this 'll mean.\nphd f: In the small training set?\ngrad a: Hello?\nphd d: I I think so. I 'll \ngrad a: Excuse me?\nphd d: It's definitely less than a hundred \ngrad a: Alright.\nphd d: You know, it's more like like thirty forty hours something like that.\ngrad a: Wrong number.\nphd f: They called to tell us that?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Um. So. Uh. after run\nphd f: I mean, I didn't want to do too big,\nprofessor b: Right. So\nphd f: just \nprofessor b: At least a couple thousand hidden units. I mean. It's it's th the thing I 'll I 'll think about it a little more\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but it it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand.\nphd f: Mmm.\nprofessor b: You definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand. It's m It's more than \nphd f: And a thousand is too small?\nprofessor b: Oh let me think about it, but I think that that uh th at some point there's diminishing returns. I mean it doesn't actually get worse, typically,\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but it but but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling the amount of time.\nphd d: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there's gonna be fewer parameters there.\ngrad a: But not by a lot.\nprofessor b: Not by much.\nphd d: And then \nprofessor b: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight?\ngrad a: Vast majority is from the input unit.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: OK. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah. It 'll have a very tiny effect.\ngrad a: Right, because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much, much larger.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Oh I see, I see, yeah, of course.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah. It's negligible, OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah, so it's it 'd be way, way less than ten percent of the difference.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: Uh. There's uh How bi how big Let's see. What am I trying to think of?\nphd f: The The net that that we did use already uh was eight thousand hidden units and that's the one that Eric trained up.\nprofessor b: Right. And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of of speech.\nphd d: Was that gender - dependent or independent?\nphd f: Gender - dependent.\nprofessor b: Oh. So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So, uh, yeah definitely not the one thousand uh two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost will be faster and almost as good.\ngrad a: It 'll be faster.\nprofessor b: So.\nphd f: Yeah.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd f: Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: OK.\nphd f: OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah, thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds. Uh, so that's like eleven eleven million frames. And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven, eight hundred thousand parameters. So that's probably That's probably fine. I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so \nphd d: Right. I actually have to go.\nprofessor b: Alright.\nphd d: So.\nprofessor b: Uncle Bernie's rule is ten to one. Bernie Woodrow's Rule of yeah Uncle Bernie yeah.\ngrad a: We 're just waiting for you to leave.\nprofessor b: Yes sir.\ngrad a: Anything else?\nprofessor b: Nah.\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour.\ngrad a: If \nprofessor b: So.\ngrad a: yeah that's right.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Uh, well, we started late.\nphd f: Transcript\nprofessor b: de - ba - de. de - ba - de That's all folks!", "en_query": "Summarize the meeting", "zh_query": "总结会议", "fr_query": "Résumer la réunion", "ukr_query": "Підведіть підсумки зустрічі", "en_summary": "The meeting concerned mostly status updates and logistical affairs.

We were two we were \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh, uh, we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point and and for two years there was this thing saying, yeah, we 're we 're two months away from being done. It was very very believable schedules, too. I mean, we went through and with the schedules and we \nphd a: It was true for two years.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Oh, yeah. It was very true.\nphd a: So, should we just do the same kind of deal where we go around and do, uh, status report kind of things? OK. And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something. So.\nprofessor b: Yeah. So we probably should wait for him to come before we do his.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: OK. That's a good idea.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad f: OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd a: Any objection? Do y OK, M\nprofessor b: All in favor\nphd a: Do you want to start, Morgan? Do you have anything, or?\nprofessor b: Uh, I don't do anything. I No, I mean, I I 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing, but I think they 're since they 're here, they can talk about it themselves.\ngrad f: OK. So should I go so that, uh,\nphd a: Yeah. Why don't you go ahead, Barry?\ngrad f: you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff, per se?\nphd a: OK.\ngrad f: OK. Um. Well, this past week I 've just been, uh, getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal. So, um Mmm. I just finished a section on, uh on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify, um, as a as a middle step. And, um, I hope to hope to get this, um a full rough draft done by, uh, Monday so I can give it to Morgan.\nphd a: When is your, uh, meeting?\ngrad f: Um, my meeting\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad f: with, uh? Oh, oh, you mean the the quals.\nphd a: The quals. Yeah.\ngrad f: Uh, the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth.\nphd a: Oh. Soon.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh - huh.\ngrad f: D - Day.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad f: Uh - huh.\nphd a: So, is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and?\ngrad f: Right, right. So, y you write up a proposal, and give it to people ahead of time, and you have a short presentation. And, um, and then, um then everybody asks you questions.\nphd a: Hmm.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: I remember now.\ngrad f: Yep. So, um.\nphd a: Have you d? I was just gonna ask, do you want to say any a little bit about it,\ngrad f: Y s\nphd a: or? Mmm.\ngrad f: Oh. Uh, a little bit about?\nphd a: Wh - what you 're what you 're gonna You said you were talking about the, uh, particular features that you were looking at,\ngrad f: Oh, the the \nphd a: or \ngrad f: Right. Well, I was, um, I think one of the perplexing problems is, um, for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away. But what I 'm thinking now is, I would start with with a reasonable set. Something something like, um, um like, uh, re regular phonetic features, just to just to start off that way. And do some phone recognition. Um, build a system that, uh, classifies these, um these feat uh, these intermediate categories using, uh, multi - band techniques. Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition. Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say, OK, well, I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category. That would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions. And then and then reiterate. Um, build the intermediate classifiers. Uh, do phoneme recognition. Look at the errors. And then postulate new or remove, um, intermediate categories. And then do it again.\nphd a: So you 're gonna use TIMIT?\ngrad f: Um, for that for that part of the the process, yeah, I would use TIMIT.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And, um, then after after, uh, um, doing TIMIT. Right?\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Um, that's that's, um that's just the ph the phone recognition task.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad f: Uh, I wanted to take a look at, um, things that I could model within word. So, I would mov I would then shift the focus to, um, something like Schw - Switchboard, uh, where I 'd I would be able to, um to model, um, intermediate categories that span across phonemes,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: not just within the phonemes, themselves, um, and then do the same process there, um, on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard. Uh, and for that for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it's already set up for for Switchboard. And I 'd run some some sort of tandem - style processing with, uh, my intermediate classifiers.\nphd a: Oh. So that's why you were interested in getting your own features into the SRI files.\ngrad f: Yeah. That's why I I was asking about that.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah. Um, and I guess that's that's it. Any any questions?\nphd a: Sounds good. So you just have a few more weeks, huh?\ngrad f: Um, yeah. A few more.\nphd a: It's about a month from now?\ngrad f: It's a it's a month and and a week.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: So, uh, you want to go next, Dave? And we 'll do \ngrad e: Oh. OK, sure. So, um, last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach. And, um, we we got an improvement, uh, in word error rate, training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of, um, six percent to four point five percent, um, on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F, but, um, the near - mike performance worsened, um, from one point two percent to two point four percent. And, um, wh why would that be, um, considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK? And so, uh, with some input from, uh, Andreas, I have a theory in two parts. Um, first of all HTK sorry, SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation, and so HTK wasn't. Um, so this, um This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case. And also, um, the Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters. It's got finer - grained acoustic models. So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio. Um. And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background. And so that seems like it could be difficult for training, cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone, um, depending on the timing of the echo. So, um, I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set, and then, eh, the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them. So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of, um, read speech, and, um Hmm.\nprofessor b: I had another thought just now, which is, uh, remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about, uh, this stuff that some of the other stuff that Avendano did, where they were, um, getting rid of low - energy sections? Um, uh, if you if you did a high - pass filtering, as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation, uh, uh, Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that, uh, perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values, and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum. So, what what Hirsch did was, uh, set them to zero set the negative values to zero. So if you imagine a a waveform that's all positive, which is the time trajectory of energy, um, and, uh, shifting it downwards, and then getting rid of the negative parts, that's essentially throwing away the low - energy things. And it's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible. You know, you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing. I mean, you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation, but because you have these non - causal windows, you 're getting these funny things coming in, uh, at n And, um, what if you did? I mean, there's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original, according to some equation. I mean, you also could, uh, just try to make it nicer.\ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: And one of the things you could do is, you could do some sort of VAD - like thing\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some, uh, very low or or near zero value. I mean, uh, I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are, uh \ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: or pre - echoes, whichever they are are are, uh, part of what's causing the problem, you actually could get rid of them.\ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: Be pretty simple. I mean, you do it in a pretty conservative way\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor b: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech.\ngrad e: Hmm.\nphd g: Um, what is the reverberation time like there?\ngrad e: In thi in this room? Uh \nphd g: On, uh, the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like?\ngrad e: Y Yeah. I I I I don't know.\nprofessor b: So, it's this room.\nphd g: It's, uh \nprofessor b: It's it's this room.\nphd g: Oh, this room?\nprofessor b: So \nphd g: OK.\nprofessor b: so it's these are just microphone this micro close microphone and a distant microphone, he's doing these different tests on.\ngrad f: Oh.\nprofessor b: Uh, we should do a measurement in here. I g think we never have. I think it's I would guess, uh, point seven, point eight seconds f uh, R T\ngrad f: Hmm!\nprofessor b: something like that? But it's you know, it's this room.\nphd g: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So.\nphd g: OK. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh. But the other thing is, he's putting in w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways. He's also putting in, uh, a he's taking out some reverberation, but he's putting in something, because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds, which are then being subtracted from the speech. And since, you know, what you subtract, sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't. And \nphd g: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away. Uh, and if it's a low energy compo portion, you might actually hear some funny things.\nphd g: Yeah.\ngrad e: O o one thing, um, I noticed is that, um, the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized. So I was wondering, is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing, because yo\ngrad e: Yeah. I don't know why - y, uh, either.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Oh, OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah. I mean, I think if you really have louder signals, what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio.\nphd c: Well, well \nprofessor b: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio, then it would be better.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio \ngrad e: It w i i it wouldn't affect things.\nprofessor b: No.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad e: OK.\nphd c: Well, the system is use the absolute energy, so it's a little bit dependent on on the signal level. But, not so much, I guess.\nprofessor b: Well, yeah. But it's trained and tested on the same thing.\nphd c: Mmm.\nprofessor b: So if the if the if you change in both training and test, the absolute level by a factor of two, it will n have no effect.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nphd a: Did you add this data to the training set, for the Aurora? Or you just tested on this?\ngrad e: Uh Um. Did I w what?\nphd a: Well, Morgan was just saying that, uh, as long as you do it in both training and testing, it shouldn't have any effect.\ngrad e: Sorry? Yeah.\nphd a: But I I was sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data.\ngrad e: I I b\nphd a: You didn't train it also.\ngrad e: I Right. I trained on clean TI - digits. I I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits. But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder.\nprofessor b: Oh, I see.\ngrad e: I only remember noticing it made the, um, PZM signal louder.\nprofessor b: OK. Well, I don't understand then. Yeah.\ngrad e: Huh. I don't know. If it's if it's like, if it's trying to find a a reverberation filter, it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter. And then if you take it out that taking it out makes things louder. I mean.\nprofessor b: Uh, no. I mean, uh, there's there's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing,\ngrad e: Nuh - huh.\nprofessor b: uh, r uh, then I don't see how that would make it louder.\ngrad e: The mean. OK. Yeah, I see.\nprofessor b: So it might be just some \ngrad e: Yeah. OK. So I should maybe listen to that stuff again.\nprofessor b: Yeah. It might just be some artifact of the processing that that, uh, if you 're Uh, yeah. I don't know.\ngrad e: Oh. OK.\nphd a: I wonder if there could be something like, uh for s for the PZM data,\nphd c: Eh\nphd a: uh, you know, if occasionally, uh, somebody hits the table or something, you could get a spike. Uh. I 'm just wondering if there's something about the, um you know, doing the mean normalization where, uh, it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio. Um.\nprofessor b: Well, you know, there is this. Wait a minute. It it i maybe i If, um Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum. So, depending what you divide by, if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number, you could make it bigger.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So, it's it's just a a question of there's It it could be that there's some normalization that's missing, or something to make it \ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh, y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger, but maybe in practice it is. That's something to think about.\ngrad e: Hmm.\nprofessor b: I don't know.\nphd c: I had a question about the system the SRI system. So, you trained it on TI - digits? But except this, it's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone. Right? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it's still O point eight. Uh, but is it exactly the same system?\ngrad e: Uh. I think so.\nphd c: Hmm.\ngrad e: If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about, um, a week and a half ago, I think it's the same system.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. So you use VTL - uh, vocal tract length normalization and, um, like MLLR transformations also,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: and \nprofessor b: I 'm sorry, was his point eight percent, er, a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training?\nphd c: all that stuff.\ngrad e: That's \nphd c: It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah, on on meeting digits.\nprofessor b: Oh. So that was done already. So we were Uh, and it's point eight? OK.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd c: Yeah. I I 've just been text testing the new Aurora front - end with well, Aurora system actually so front - end and HTK, um, acoustic models on the meeting digits and it's a little bit better than the previous system. We have I have two point seven percent error rate. And before with the system that was proposed, it's what? It was three point nine. So.\nprofessor b: Oh, that's a lot better.\nphd c: We are getting better.\nprofessor b: So, what w?\nphd c: And \nphd g: With the with the HTK back - end? What we have for Aurora?\nphd c: Yeah. Two point seven.\nphd g: I know in the meeting, like \nphd c: On the meeting we have two point seven.\nphd g: Right. Oh.\ngrad f: That's with the new IIR filters?\nphd c: Uh. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah,\ngrad f: OK.\nphd c: we have the new LDA filters, and I think, maybe I didn't look, but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation. Uh, eh Do y did you have a look at at the meet uh, meeting digits, if they have a DC component, or?\ngrad e: I I didn't. No.\nphd c: Oh.\nprofessor b: Hmm.\nphd g: No. The DC component could be negligible. I mean, if you are recording it through a mike. I mean, any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it.\nprofessor b: Yeah. But this uh, uh, uh, no. Because, uh, there's a sample and hold in the A - toD. And these period these typically do have a DC offset.\nphd g: Oh, OK.\nprofessor b: And and they can be surprisingly large. It depends on the electronics.\nphd g: Oh, so it is the digital OK. It's the A - toD that introduces the DC in.\nprofessor b: Yeah. The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC.\nphd g: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor b: But but,\nphd g: OK.\nprofessor b: typi you know, unless Actually, there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC. But but,\nphd g: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: uh, no, it's the electronics. And they and \nphd g: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: then there's amplification afterwards. And you can get, I think it was I think it was in the Wall Street Journal data that that I can't remember, one of the DARPA things. There was this big DC - DC offset\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: we didn't we didn't know about for a while, while we were messing with it. And we were getting these terrible results. And then we were talking to somebody and they said, \" Oh, yeah. Didn't you know? Everybody knows that. There's all this DC offset in th \" So, yes. You can have DC offset in the data.\nphd g: Oh, OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd g: OK.\nphd a: So was that was that everything, Dave?\ngrad e: Oh. And I also, um, did some experiments about normalizing the phase. Um. So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at. And, um, the interesting thing that I tried was, um, Adam and Morgan had this idea, um, since my original attempts to, um, take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that, by subtracting that off, didn't work. Um, so, well, that we thought that might be due to, um, problems with, um, the arithmetic of phases. They they add in this modulo two pi way and, um, there's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct. So, what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything, and then I took the phase of that, and I subtracted that phase off to normalize. But that, um, didn't work either.\nprofessor b: See, we have a different interpretation of this. He says it doesn't work. I said, I think it works magnificently, but just not for the task we intended. Uh, it gets rid of the speech.\nphd a: What does it leave?\ngrad f: Uh, gets rid of the speech.\nprofessor b: Uh, it leaves you know, it leaves the junk. I mean, I I think it's it's tremendous.\ngrad f: Oh, wow.\nprofessor b: You see, all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before, and he's really got something.\nphd a: Well, could you take what was left over and then subtract that?\nprofessor b: Ex - exactly. Yeah, you got it.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd g: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So, it's it's a general rule.\nphd g: Oh, it's \nprofessor b: Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite. Including what I just said.\ngrad e: And, yeah, that's everything.\nphd a: All set? Do you want to go, Stephane?\nphd c: Um. Yeah. Maybe, concerning these d still, these meeting digits. I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system. And Um. Yeah. So, I think I will maybe train, like, gender - dependent models, because this is also one big difference between the two systems. Um, the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more SRI system are more complex. But, uh, Chuck, you did some experiments with this and\nphd a: It didn't seem to help in the HTK system.\nphd c: it was hard t to to have some exper some improvement with this. Um.\nprofessor b: Well, it sounds like they also have he he's saying they have all these, uh, uh, different kinds of adaptation.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: You know, they have channel adaptation. They have speaker adaptation.\nphd c: Yeah. Right.\nphd a: Well, there's also the normalization.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: Like they do, um I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits,\nphd c: The vocal tr\nphd a: but, like, in the Switchboard data, there's, um conversation - side normalization for the non - C - zero components,\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. This is another difference. Their normalization works like on on the utterance levels.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: But we have to do it We have a system that does it on - line.\nphd a: Right.\nphd c: So, it might be it might be better with it might be worse if the channel is constant,\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: or Nnn.\nphd g: And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or or is it the whole word?\nphd c: SRI it's it's tr\ngrad f: SRI.\nphd g: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah. I guess it's triphones.\nphd g: It's triphone.\nprofessor b: I think it's probably more than that.\nphd c: Huh.\nprofessor b: I mean, so they they have I I thin think they use these, uh, uh, genone things. So there's there's these kind of, uh, uh, pooled models and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies.\nphd g: Oh. It's like the tied state.\nprofessor b: So.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: They have tied states and I think I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here. But I think I think they they don't just have triphones.\nphd g: OK.\nprofessor b: I think they have a range of of, uh, dependencies.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Hmm.\nphd c: And Yeah. Well. Um. Well, the first thing I that I want to do is just maybe these gender things. Uh. And maybe see with Andreas if Well, I I don't know how much it helps, what's the model.\nphd a: So so the n stuff on the numbers you got, the two point seven, is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two?\nphd c: That's right. So it's the clean TI - digits training set.\nphd a: So exact same training data?\nphd c: Right.\nphd a: OK.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. I guess you used the clean training set.\ngrad e: Right.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: For with the SRI system \nphd c: Well.\ngrad e: You know, the the Aurora baseline is set up with these, um this version of the clean training set that's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter, and, um, to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits, um, under U doctor - speech data TI - digits, which don't have this filter. But I don't think there's any other difference.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor b: So is that? Uh, are are these results comparable? So you you were getting with the, uh, Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits, when, uh, training the SRI system with clean TR digits  TI - digits. Right? And \ngrad e: Um. Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: Yeah. And, so, is your two point seven comparable, where you 're, uh, uh, using, uh, the submitted system?\nphd c: Yeah. I think so.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So it's about the same,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: maybe a little worse.\ngrad e: W w it was one one point two\nphd c: Ye\ngrad e: with the SRI system,\nprofessor b: I 'm sorry.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad e: I \nphd c: The complete SRI system is one point two.\nprofessor b: You you were HTK.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Right? OK. That's right. So \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: OK, so the comparable number then, uh for what you were talking about then, since it was HTK, would be the um, two point f\nphd c: It was four point something. Right? The HTK system with, uh, b\ngrad e: D d\nprofessor b: Oh, right, right, right, right.\nphd c: MFCC features \ngrad e: Do you mean the b? The baseline Aurora - two system, trained on TI - digits, tested on Meeting Recorder near, I think we saw in it today, and it was about six point six percent.\nprofessor b: Right. Right, right, right.\nphd c: Oh.\nprofessor b: OK. Alright. So He's doing some different things.\nphd c: So Yeah. The only difference is the features, right now, between this and \nprofessor b: Yes. OK, good. So they are helping.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: That's good to hear. Yeah.\nphd c: They are helping. Yeah. Um. Yeah. And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test the SRI system that's trained on Macrophone test it on, uh, the noisy TI - digits,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: cuz I 'm still wondering where this improvement comes from. When you train on Macrophone, it seems better on meeting digits. But I wonder if it's just because maybe Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than TI - digit is, which is TI - digits are very clean recorded digits\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: and \nphd a: You know, it would also be interesting to see, uh to do the regular Aurora test,\nphd c: Uh, f s\nphd a: um, but use the SRI system instead of HTK.\nphd c: That's Yeah. That's what I wanted, just, uh Yeah. So, just using the SRI system, test it on and test it on Aurora TI - digits. Right.\nphd a: Why not the full Aurora, uh, test?\nphd c: Um. Yeah. There is this problem of multilinguality yet.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: So we don't \nprofessor b: You 'd have to train the SRI system with with all the different languages.\nphd c: i i\nphd a: Right.\nphd c: We would have to train on \nphd a: Yeah. That's what I mean.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: So, like, comple\nprofessor b: It 'd be a lot of work. That's the only thing.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: It's \nphd a: Well, I mean,\nphd c: Mmm.\nphd a: uh, uh, I guess the work would be into getting the the files in the right formats, or something. Right? I mean \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Because when you train up the Aurora system, you 're, uh you 're also training on all the data.\nphd c: That's right.\nphd a: I mean, it's \nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. I see. Oh, so, OK. Right. I see what you mean.\nprofessor b: That's true, but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week, oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: because on on whatever it is they 're trying, because it's a lot of work, even just with the HTK.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So, it's it's a good idea, but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: first with a a test or two that makes sense for you,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and then take the likely candidates and go further.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yeah. But, just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information about what's going on. And mm - hmm. Uh, yeah. OK. Uh, the next thing is this this VAD problem that, um, um So, I 'm just talking about the the curves that I I sent I sent you so, whi that shows that when the SNR decrease, uh, the current VAD approach doesn't drop much frames for some particular noises, uh, which might be then noises that are closer to speech, uh, acoustically.\nprofessor b: I i Just to clarify something for me. I They were supp Supposedly, in the next evaluation, they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So does any of this matter? I mean, other than our interest in it. Uh \nphd c: Uh Well. First of all, the boundaries might be, uh like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech. Uh. So removing more than that might still make a difference in the results.\nprofessor b: Do we? I mean, is there some reason that we think that's the case?\nphd c: And No. Because we don't didn't looked that much at that.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: But, still, I think it's an interesting problem.\nprofessor b: Oh, yeah.\nphd c: And Um. Yeah.\nprofessor b: But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when, uh, the gang gets back from Crete. Because there's lots of interesting problems, of course.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight, uh, boundaries, then that won't be so much the issue.\nphd c: Yeah, yeah. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Um But I don't know.\nphd g: Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be, like, a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation. And then, like, if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one, then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around, I mean, the way we want\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: to find a I mean, rather than keeping the twenty frames, we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd g: But if that is going to be something like a manual, uh, segmenter, then we can't use that information anymore,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: because that's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd g: So. We don't know what is the type of  VAD which they 're going to provide.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah. And actually there's Yeah. There's an uh, I think it's still for even for the evaluation, uh, it might still be interesting to work on this because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just, um, starting of speech and end of speech uh, at the utterance level. And Um.\nphd g: With some some gap.\nphd c: So \nphd g: I mean, with some pauses in the center, provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking.\nphd c: Yeah. But when you have like, uh, five or six frames, both \nphd g: Yeah. Then the they will just fill fill it up.\nphd c: it it with \nphd g: I mean, th Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So if you could get at some of that, uh \nphd c: So \nprofessor b: although that 'd be hard.\nphd c: Yeah. It might be useful for, like, noise estimation, and a lot of other things that we want to work on.\nprofessor b: But but Yeah.\nphd g: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Right. OK.\nphd c: But Mmm. Yeah. So I did I just started to test putting together two VAD which was was not much work actually. Um, I im re - implemented a VAD that's very close to the, um, energy - based VAD that, uh, the other Aurora guys use. Um. So, which is just putting a threshold on the noise energy,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: and, detect detecting the first group of four frames that have a energy that's above this threshold, and, uh, from this point, uh, tagging the frames there as speech. So it removes the first silent portion portion of each utterance. And it really removes it, um, still o on the noises where our MLP VAD doesn't work a lot.\nprofessor b: Mmm.\nphd c: Uh,\nprofessor b: Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information,\nphd c: and \nprofessor b: uh uh, you know, in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings, for instance uh, would give you some better performance. Right? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or, uh stop consonants, or something like that.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh.\nphd c: Yeah. So, your point is will be to u use whatever \nprofessor b: Oh, that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral, then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech. And, um,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: just as a gross generalization, most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic, some sort of slope. And and most, um, low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high - pass kind of characteristic \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: an upward slope. So having some kind of a \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: uh, you know, at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance, just starting in, it might be pretty low - energy,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but it will tend to have this high - frequency component. Whereas, a a lot of rumble, and background noises, and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency. Uh, you know, by itself it's not enough to tell you, but it plus energy is sort of \nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: it plus energy plus timing information is sort of \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I mean, if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something, that's sort of what they were using then.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So it's it's not a \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Hmm.\nphd c: So, yeah. It it might be that what I did is so, removes like low, um, uh low - energy, uh, speech frames. Because the way I do it is I just I just combine the two decisions so, the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based with the with the and operator. So, I only keep the frames where the two agree that it's speech. So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech, mmm, they they are they are lost. Mmm.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: But s still, the way it's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where our VAD was not very good.\nprofessor b: Well, I guess I mean, one could imagine combining them in different ways. But but, I guess what you 're saying is that the the MLP - based one has the spectral information. So.\nphd c: Yeah. But Yeah. But the way it's combined wi is maybe done Well, yeah.\nprofessor b: Well, you can imagine \nphd c: The way I use a an a \" AND \" operator is So, it I, uh \nprofessor b: Is?\nphd c: The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are are, uh, dropped, even if the, um, MLP decides to keep them.\nprofessor b: Right. Right. And that might not be optimal,\nphd c: But, yeah.\nprofessor b: but \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: No\nprofessor b: but I mean, I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a uh, a probability estimated by each one and and put them together.\nphd c: Yeah. Mmm. M Yeah.\nphd a: Something that that I 've used in the past is, um when just looking at the energy, is to look at the derivative. And you make your decision when the derivative is increasing for so many frames. Then you say that's beginning of speech.\nphd c: Uh - huh.\nphd a: But, I 'm I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer. I guess it depends on how you do it. But I mean, that's that's been a useful thing.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: Yeah. Well, every everywhere has a delay associated with it. I mean, you still have to k always keep a buffer,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: then only make a decision because you still need to smooth the decision further.\nphd a: Right. Right.\nphd g: So that's always there.\nphd a: Yeah. OK.\nphd c: Well, actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now. I just wanted to to see if it's what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: And it seems to be the case. Um. Uh, the second thing is the this spectral subtraction. Um. Um, which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of, uh, twenty - five experiments, uh, with different, uh, values for the parameters that are used. So, it's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use an over - estimation factor. So, we substr I subtract more, um, noise than the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the s uh, the utterances. So I tried several, uh, over - estimation factors. And after subtraction, I also add a constant noise, and I also try different, uh, noise, uh, values and we 'll see what happen.\nprofessor b: Hmm. OK.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. But st still when we look at the, um Well, it depends on the parameters that you use, but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add, you st have a lot of musical noise. Um. On the other hand, when you subtract more and when you add more noise, you get rid of this musical noise but maybe you distort a lot of speech. So. Well. Mmm. Well, it until now, it doesn't seem to help. But We 'll see. So the next thing, maybe I what I will try to to do is just to try to smooth mmm, the, um to smooth the d the result of the subtraction, to get rid of the musical noise, using some kind of filter, or \nphd g: Can smooth the SNR estimate, also.\nphd c: Yeah. Right. Mmm.\nphd g: Your filter is a function of SNR. Hmm?\nphd c: Yeah. So, to get something that's would be closer to what you tried to do with Wiener filtering.\nphd g: Yeah.\nphd c: And Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nphd g: Actually, it's, uh Uh. I don't know, it's go ahead.\nphd c: It \nphd g: And it's \nphd c: Maybe you can \nphd g: go ahead.\nphd c: I think it's That's it for me.\nphd g: OK. So, uh u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter, like. And there are there were some bugs in the program, so I was p initially trying to clear them up. Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD uh, the initial frames were silence. It always started in the silence state, but it wasn't for some utterances. So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially, and then it never estimated, because I assumed that it was always silence.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian?\nphd g: Yeah.\nphd c: So, in some cases s there are also \nphd g: SpeechDat - Car Italian. Yeah. There 're a few cases, actually, which I found later, that there are.\nphd c: o Uh - huh.\nphd g: So that was one of the bugs that was there in estimating the noise. And, uh, so once it was cleared, uh, I ran a few experiments with different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and, eh, smoothing the SNR also. And so the the trend seems to be like, uh, smoothing the current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR, which is like deriving the Wiener filter, seems to be helping. Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant. So we 'll have, like, a few results where the estimating the the More smoothing is helping. But still it's like it's still comparable to the baseline. I haven't got anything beyond the baseline. But that's, like, not using any Wiener filter. And, uh, so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum, and smoothing the clean speech, and smoothing SNR. So there are three time constants that I have. So, I 'm just playing around. So, one is fixed in the line, like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping, so I 'm not going to change it that much. But, the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR, I 'm just trying trying a little bit. So, that h And the other thing is, like, putting a floor on the, uh, SNR, because that if some In some cases the clean speech is, like when it's estimated, it goes to very low values, so the SNR is, like, very low. And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech. So, I 'm thinking of, like, putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions. And, uh. So. The results are, like So far I 've been testing only with the baseline, which is which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization. I just want to separate the the contributions out. So it's just VAD, plus the Wiener filter, plus the baseline system, which is, uh, just the spectral I mean, the mel sp mel, uh, frequency coefficients. Um. And the other thing that I tried was but I just took of those, uh, Carlos filters, which Hynek had, to see whether it really h helps or not. I mean, it was just a a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps. And it's it seems to be like it's not hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a four hertz a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum. So, that was the filter that Hy - uh, Carlos had. And so Yeah. Just just to see whether it really it's it's is it worth trying or not. So, it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that. So there must be something that I can that can be done with that type of noise compensation also, which I guess I would ask Carlos about that. I mean, how how he derived those filters and and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories, added with some type of noise which what we are using currently, or something like that. So maybe I 'll \nprofessor b: This is cubic root of power spectra?\nphd g: Yeah. Cubic root of power spectrum.\nprofessor b: So, if you have this band - pass filter, you probably get n you get negative values. Right?\nphd g: Yeah. And I 'm, like, floating it to z zeros right now.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd g: So it has, like the spectrogram has, like Uh, it actually, uh, enhances the onset and offset of I mean, the the begin and the end of the speech. So it's there seems to be, like, deep valleys in the begin and the end of, like, high - energy regions,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: because the filter has, like, a sort of Mexican - hat type structure.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: So, those are the regions where there are, like when I look at the spectrogram, there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech. But the rest of it seems to be, like, pretty nice.\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd g: So. That's something I observe using that filter. And Yeah. There are a few very not a lot of because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion, so that it's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root. So, I 'll I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll I 'll Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters, and but while making this Wiener filter better. So. Yeah. That that's it, Morgan.\nprofessor b: Uh, last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff?\nphd g: Yeah. I I I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week. It was mostly about finding those bugs and\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd g: th you know, things, and I didn't work much on that.\nphd a: How about you, Carmen?\nphd d: Well, I am still working with, eh, VTS. And, one of the things that last week, eh, say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy.\nprofessor b: Hmm?\nphd d: And, maybe, talking with Stephane and with Sunil, we decide that maybe it was interesting to to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS. But then we decided that that's it doesn't work absolutely, because we modified also the noise. And Well, thinking about that, we we then we decide that maybe is a good idea. We don't know. I don't hav I don't this is I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS in cepstral domain.\nprofessor b: The other thing is So so, in i i and Not and C - zero would be a different So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway. I mean, the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have two kinds of normalization with with, uh, different time constants. So, uh, you could do some normalization s uh, before the VTS, and then do some other normalization after. I don't know. But but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do,\nphd d: Uh.\nprofessor b: so that's \nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Well, we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain. And Well. I am working in that now,\nprofessor b: Uh - huh.\nphd d: but I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful. I don't know. It's k it's k It's quite a lot It's a lot of work.\nprofessor b: Uh - huh.\nphd d: Well, it's not too much, but this it's work.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: And I want to know if if we have some feeling that the result I I would like to know if I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain. I r I 'm not sure. I don't I don't know absolutely nothing.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well, you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS, so, uh, maybe we could call someone else up who has, ask them their opinion. Uh,\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: I don't I don't have a good feeling for it. Um.\nphd g: Pratibha.\nphd c: Actually, the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the level of the speech signal.\nphd d: Yeah?\nphd c: And So I expect it If if you have something that's independent of this, I expect it to it to, uh, be a better model of speech.\nphd d: To have better \nphd c: And. Well.\nprofessor b: You you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra. Right? I mean, you can just sort of normalize the \nphd c: No. We could normali norm I mean, remove the median.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. And then you have one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and the other which isn't.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yeah. But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean of speech and not of noise.\nphd d: Ye\nphd c: Because it's like first doing general normalization\nphd d: Yea\nphd c: and then noise removal, which is \nphd d: Yeah. We I was thinking to to to estimate the noise with the first frames and then apply the VAD,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: before the on - line normalization.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: We we see Well, I am thinking about that and working about that,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: but I don't have result this week.\nprofessor b: Sure. I mean, one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon, is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods, how do they fit in with one another? Because we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them. Maybe maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their characteristics are,\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: so we can see what should be combined.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Is that it? OK?\nprofessor b: OK. Why don't we read some digits?\nphd a: Yep.

How about \" topic - comment \" that's the other side of information.\ngrad f: How about what?\ngrad a: Topic - comment.\ngrad f: Yeah, so that was the other thing. And so I didn't realize it before. It's like, \" oh! \" It was an epiphany that it you know, topic and focus are a contrast set.

And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session and I I have found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events, eh besides the overlapping zones, eh I I I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh, eh, talk eh, eh, clap, eh  I don't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech\nphd a: Nonspeech sounds?\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad g: Oh, I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail. So.\nphd d: Yeah. Eh, I I I do I don't need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic, but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh, I I will find eh, eh, a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh, eh acoustic events, to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh, the false eh hypothesis eh, nnn, which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh I mean pitch eh, eh, difference eh, feature \ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: You know I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there's two there.\ngrad g: So it was \nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: I mean, if it's a tapping sound, you wouldn't necessarily or, you know, something like that, it 'd be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad g: Well You weren't talking about just overlaps\nphd d: Ye\ngrad g: were you? You were just talking about acoustic events.\nphd d: I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general,\ngrad g: Someone starts, someone stops Yeah.\nphd a: Oh.\nphd d: but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone.\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Eh? n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events.\nprofessor e: How many overlaps were there uh in it? No no, how many of them were the overlaps of speech, though?\nphd d: How many? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session\ngrad g: Oh, God!\nphd d: in five eh in forty - five minutes.\nphd a: Three hundred overlapping speech \nphd d: Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone.\ngrad g: Ugh.\nphd c: Overlapping speech.\nphd d: With the overlapping zone, overlapping speech speech what eh different duration.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Sure.\npostdoc b: Does this? So if you had an overlap involving three people, how many times was that counted?\nphd d: Yeah, three people, two people. Eh, um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background, be\nprofessor e: No no, but I think what she's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking, instead of two, did you call that one event?\nphd d: Oh. Oh. Yeah. I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone. This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event, the overlapping zone, the period where three speaker or eh are talking together.\ngrad g: Well So let's \npostdoc b: For\ngrad g: So let's say me and Jane are talking at the same time, and then Liz starts talking also over all of us. How many events would that be?\nphd d: So - I don't understand.\ngrad g: So, two people are talking, and then a third person starts talking.\nphd d: Yeah?\ngrad g: Is there an event right here?\nphd d: Eh no. No no. For me is the overlapping zone, because because you you have s you have more one eh, more one voice eh, eh produced in a in in a moment.\nprofessor e: I see.\ngrad g: So i if two or more people are talking.\nprofessor e: OK. Yeah. So I think Yeah. We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it.\nphd d: Yeah. If\nprofessor e: So then, in the region between since there there is some continuous region, in between regions where there is only one person speaking.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor e: And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor e: Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: or are you calling the entire length of it the event?\nphd d: I consider the the, nnn the nnn, nnn eh, the entirety eh, eh, all all the time there were the voice has overlapped.\nprofessor e: OK.\nphd d: This is the idea. But eh I I don't distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker. Uh, I 'm not considering eh the the ehm eh, the fact of eh, eh, for example, what did you say? Eh at first eh, eh two talkers are uh, eh speaking, and eh, eh a third person eh join to to that. For me, it's eh it's eh, all overlap zone, with eh several numbers of speakers is eh, eh the same acoustic event. Wi - but uh, without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together, and the zone with the three speakers.\npostdoc b: That would j just be one.\nphd d: It One. One.\npostdoc b: OK.\nphd d: Eh, with eh, a beginning mark and the ending mark. Because eh for me, is the is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral.\nprofessor e: Got it.\nphd d: I don't mind By the moment, by the moment.\ngrad g: Well, but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two.\nphd d: I I don't Yeah, but eh but eh I have to study. What will happen in a general way,\nprofessor e: Could.\ngrad g: So. You had to start somewhere.\nprofessor e: Yeah. We just w\nphd c: So there's a lot of overlap.\nphd d: I I don't know what eh will will happen with the \ngrad g: Yep.\nphd c: So.\ngrad g: That's a lot of overlap,\nphd d: Yeah?\nprofessor e: So again, that's that's three three hundred in forty - five minutes that are that are speakers, just speakers.\ngrad g: yeah, for forty - five minutes.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor e: Uh - huh. OK. Yeah.\npostdoc b: But a a a th\nprofessor e: So that's about eight per minute.\npostdoc b: But a thousand events in twelve minutes, that's \nphd d: Yeah, but Yeah.\nphd c: But that can include taps.\nphd d: But \nprofessor e: Uh. Yeah.\npostdoc b: Well, but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot.\nphd d: General.\nphd c: Actually \nphd d: I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh, the silent too.\npostdoc b: Silent.\ngrad g: Silence starting or silence ending \nphd d: Yeah, silent, ground to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech.\nphd c: Oh, OK.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Oh.\nphd d: In ge in in in a general point of view.\nphd c: Oh.\nprofessor e: OK, so how many of those thousand were silence?\nphd c: Alright.\nphd d: in the per\nphd f: Not speech not speech or too much speech.\nphd d: Too much speech.\nprofessor e: Right.

{"fname": "academic_dev_50", "dialogue": "professor a: Guess you could, yeah.\nphd b: Bin them up into different categories and \nprofessor a: Yeah. So anyway that's that's uh that's another whole direction that cou could be looked at. Um. Um. I mean in general it's gonna be for new data that you look at, it's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and Um. So.\ngrad e: Right. Right.\nphd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones.\ngrad e: Right.\nphd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: I see.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Yeah. So wh yeah, where this fits into the rest in in my mind, I guess, is that um we 're looking at different ways that we can combine uh different kinds of of rep front - end representations um in order to get robustness under difficult or even, you know, typical conditions. And part of it, this robustness, seems to come from uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it, at least for one one um articulatory feature. The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have, since I mean, one of the things that's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it um the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than um just assuming that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength towards uh it being this phone or that phone. Right? So it so um he's got these um uh uh\nphd b: Hmm.\nprofessor a: he \" AND's \" between these different features. It's a soft \" AND \", I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR's \" across the different soft \" OR's \" across the different uh multi - band channels. And um the weight yeah, the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that's kept uh as a hidden variable, and is learned with EM. Whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nphd b: So he doesn't have \nprofessor a: which means that it's it's uh i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to um uh train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band. You you wanna ignore that band, cuz that's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up. In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting. Uh. Maybe that's not the right thing to do.\nphd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho\ngrad e: F right, and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels.\nprofessor a: Well at the at the tail end, yeah, he has to know what's where it's sonorant. But he's but what he's - but what he's not training up uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\ngrad e: Right. For the full band.\nprofessor a: um I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band? Is it sonorant in that band?\ngrad e: Right.\nprofessor a: Is it sonorant in that band? i It's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant. So\nphd b: Mm - hmm. OK.\nprofessor a: then it comes down to, you know, to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision. And um uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything uh with with uh equal strength.\nphd b: I see.\nprofessor a: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities, if we had uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can. But um this is something that's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the \nphd b: So where did he get his uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what's sonorant and what's not?\ngrad e: From uh canonical mappings um at first", "en_query": "What did the professor think about clustering?", "zh_query": "教授对聚类分析有什么看法？", "fr_query": "Que pense le professeur du clustering ?", "ukr_query": "Що думав професор про кластеризацію?", "en_summary": "The professor was not too excited about clustering.

Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition. Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say, OK, well, I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category. That would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions. And then and then reiterate. Um, build the intermediate classifiers. Uh, do phoneme recognition. Look at the errors.

Check one.\ngrad a: And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by, uh, watching the little bars change.\ngrad b: So, which is my bar? Mah! Number one.\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad e: Sibilance. Sibilance.\ngrad a: So, actually, if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now, as long as you 've signed the consent form, that's alright.\ngrad e: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time?\ngrad a: No. No.\ngrad e: Oh, OK.\ngrad a: Each individually. We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult. To try to read them while everyone else is.\ngrad e: Everyone would need extreme focus.\ngrad a: So, when you 're reading the digit strings, the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on.\nprofessor c: Other way. We m We may wind up with ver We we may need versions of all this garbage.\ngrad b: For our stuff. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Um. So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: So. You can see the transcript? There's two large number strings on the digits? So you would just read that one. And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines. And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins. And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first, so can see how that goes. Um. Again, I 'm not sure how much I should talk about stuff before everyone's here.\nprofessor c: Mmm. Well, we have one more coming.\ngrad a: OK. Well, why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there.\nprofessor c: OK. Well, we can start doing it.\ngrad a: Thanks. So, uh, just also a note on wearing the microphones. All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly, but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth, and then, at the corner. And that's so that you minimize breath sounds, so that when you 're breathing, you don't breathe into the mike. Um. Yeah, that's good. And uh So, everyone needs to fill out, only once, the speaker form and the consent form. And the short form I mean, you should read the consent form, but uh, the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts. So, if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public, which, these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them, uh, you 'll be given an opportunity by email, uh, to bleep out any portions you don't like. Um. On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can. If you 're not exactly sure about the region, we 're not exactly sure either. So, don't worry too much about it. The It's just self rating. Um. And I think that's about it. I mean, should I Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is?\nprofessor c: Um, yeah.\ngrad a: or?\nprofessor c: No. There was there was Let's see. Oh \ngrad e: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here?\ngrad b: I sent an email.\nprofessor c: She got an emai she was notified.\ngrad e: Oh yeah, she got an e Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Whether she knows is another question. Um. So are the people going to be identified by name?\ngrad a: Well, what we 're gonna we 'll anonymize it in the transcript. Um, but not in the audio.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: So the\nprofessor c: OK. So, then in terms of people worrying about, uh, excising things from the transcript, it's unlikely. Since it it does isn't attributed. Oh, I see, but the a but the but the \ngrad a: Right, so if I said, \" Oh, hi Jerry, how are you? \", we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Sure.\ngrad a: Um, so we will go through and, in the speaker ID tags there 'll be, you know, M - one O seven, M - one O eight.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: Um, but uh,\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: um, it w uh, I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio, and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data.\nprofessor c: OK. Mm - hmm. No, I I wasn't complaining,\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor c: I just wanted to understand.\ngrad a: Right.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad b: Well, we can make up aliases for each of us.\ngrad a: Yeah, I mean, whatever you wanna do is fine,\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad a: but we find that We want the meeting to be as natural as possible. So, we 're trying to do real meetings.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad a: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: and we don't want people to be editing what they say.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad a: So I think that it's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: You know?\nprofessor c: Right. Um, OK. So why don't you tell us briefly\ngrad a: OK. So th\nprofessor c: your give give your e normal schpiel.\ngrad a: Um. So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project. Um. So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future. This is a mock - up of one. Yes, we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood. Um. The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting, and record it, and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on, on the meeting. So that's my particular interest, is a portable device to do m uh, information retrieval on meetings. Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings. Um. So the first step on that, in any of these, is to collect some data. And so what we wanted is a room that's instrumented with both the table top microphones, and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes, as well as the close talking mikes. What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth, gives us, um, high quality audio, um, especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus. So, for people who are more interested in language, we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available. And then also, um, it's a very, very hard task in terms of speech recognition. Um. And so, uh, on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results. So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two. So that's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time. And then, all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like, um, beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that. Our intention is to release this data to the public, um, probably through f through a body like the LDC. And, uh, just make it as a generally available corpus. Um. There's other work going on in meeting recording. So, we 're we 're working with SRI, with UW, Um. NIST has started an effort which will include video. We 're not including video, obviously. And uh and then also, um, a small amount of assistance from IBM. Is also involved. Um. Oh, and the digit strings, this is just a more constrained task. Um. So because the general environment is so challenging, we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier. And it's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits, which is a common connected digits corpus. So we 'll have some, um, comparison to be able to be made.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad a: Anything else?\nprofessor c: No.\ngrad a: OK, so when the l last person comes in, just have them wear a wireless.

{"fname": "academic_dev_43", "dialogue": "professor d: Alright. So this is I was thinking all this was worse. OK so this is all better\nphd b: Yes, better.\nprofessor d: because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. I 'm I 'm all better now. OK, go ahead.\nphd a: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh, when we apply a neural network, is the same. We j jump to ninety percent.\nphd b: Nnn, we don't know exactly.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: And And um whatever the normalization, actually. If we use n neural network, even if the features are not correctly normalized, we jump to ninety percent. So \nprofessor d: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety, or something.\nphd a: Well, ninety No, I I mean ninety It's around eighty - nine, ninety, eighty - eight.\nprofessor d: Eighty - nine.\nphd a: Well, there are minor minor differences.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And then adding the MSG does nothing, basically.\nphd a: No.\nprofessor d: Yeah. OK.\nphd a: Uh For Italian, yeah.\nprofessor d: For this case, right?\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor d: Alright. So, um So actually, the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG, if you uh does not help in that case.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Um \nphd a: But w Yeah.\nprofessor d: The other ones, we 'd have to look at it, but And the multi - English, does uh So if we think of this in error rates, we start off with, uh eighteen percent error rate, roughly.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Um and we uh almost, uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net.\nphd a: Yeah\nprofessor d: And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things.\nphd a: No.\nprofessor d: And we cut off, I guess about twenty - five percent of the error. Uh no, not quite that, is it. Uh, two point six out of eighteen. About, um sixteen percent or something of the error, um, if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Not matching condition, but uh, the uh, Italian training.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd b: We select these these these tasks because it's the more difficult.\nprofessor d: Yes, good. OK? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching, uh, data for the uh for the new for the other languages and so forth. Um, one qu thing is that, uh I think I asked you this before, but I wanna double check. When you say \" ME \" in these other tests, that's the multi - English,\nphd a: That's it's a part it's \nprofessor d: but it is not all of the multi - English, right? It is some piece of part of it.\nphd a: Or, one million frames.\nprofessor d: And the multi - English is how much?\nphd b: You have here the information.\nphd a: It's one million and a half. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Oh, so you used almost all You used two thirds of it,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: you think. So, it it's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: I wonder why Yeah.

{"fname": "academic_dev_53", "dialogue": "phd b: Yes, I 'm playing. Um so I wanted to do this experiment to see um uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things. And so I had this um I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment, this matrix where I would take the um the original um the original system. So there's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again. So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end.\nprofessor a: What which test set was this?\nphd b: This is that I looked at?\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that um that uh Stephane had. So um I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to uh to improve it. So. One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and just looked at, you know, the number of phones in each one of the digits. Um you know, sort of the canonical way of setting up a an HMM system is that you use um three states per phone and um so then the the total number of states for a word would just be, you know, the number of phones times three. And so when I did that for the Italian digits, I got a number of states, ranging on the low end from nine to the high end, eighteen. Um. Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there's an initial null and a final null so when they use uh models that have eighteen states, there 're really sixteen states. They 've got those initial and final null states. And so um their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits, the four and five which um, according to my, you know, sort of off the cuff calculation, should have eighteen states each.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And so they had sixteen. So that's pretty close. Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter. So the majority of them wanna have nine states. And so theirs are s sort of twice as long. So my guess uh And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the well - matched case, and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best. So my guess about what's happening is that you know, if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have, you know, half as much training data for those models. Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states, uh you 've got you know, you 've got the same number of Gaussians, you 've gotta train in each case,\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: but for the shorter words, you know, the total number of frames is actually half as many.", "en_query": "How did PhD B approach the back-end of the Aurora recognizer?", "zh_query": "博士生B是如何处理Aurora识别器后台的？", "fr_query": "Comment Doctorat B a-t-il abordé le back-end du module de reconnaissance Aurora ?", "ukr_query": "Як доктор філософії В підходив до вивідних пристроїв розпізнавача Аврора?", "en_summary": "PhD B focused on Italian and experimented with the number of states for different words.

{"fname": "academic_dev_39", "dialogue": "grad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not active.\nprofessor c: This Uh yeah, well there there seems to be context properties.\ngrad f: So.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, they 're contex and for instance, I used to have a location thing there but actually that's a property of the situation. And it's again, time, you know at cert certain points things are located, you know, near or far from you\nprofessor c: Well, uh, uh, this is recursive\ngrad f: and \nprofessor c: cuz until we do the uh, mental space story, we 're not quite sure  Th - th\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: which is fine. We 'll just we 'll j\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah. So some of these are, uh \nprofessor c: we just don't know yet.\ngrad f: Right. So I so for now I thought, well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance, right? Everything else here is utterance - specific. Um, and I left the slot, \" predications \", open because you can have, um, things like \" the guy I know from school \".\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Or, you know, like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know, predications that you might make. And it's unclear whether I mean, you could just have in your scenario, \" here are some extra few things that are true \", right?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And then you could just sort of not have this slot here. Right? You 're but but it's used for identification purposes.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: So it's it's a little bit different from just saying \" all these things are true from my utterance \".\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Um.\ngrad e: Right, \" this guy I know from school came for dinner \" does not mean, um, \" there's a guy, I know him from school, and he came over for dinner \". That's not the same effect.\ngrad f: Yeah, it's a little bit it's a little bit different. Right? So Or maybe that's like a restrictive, non - restrictive \ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: you know, it's like it gets into that kind of thing for um, but maybe I 'm mixing, you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So you might imagine that the information you pass to, you know in identifying a particular referent would be, \" oh, some \" you know, \" it's a guy and it's someone I know from school \".\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: So maybe that would, you know, be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the, whatever, construal engine or whatever, discourse context, to find you know, either create this reference,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: in which case it 'd be created here, and you know, so so you could imagine that this might not So, uh, I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things.\ngrad a: But to make it m precise at least in my mind, uh, it's not precise.\ngrad f: Um.\ngrad a: So \" house \" is gender neuter? In reality\ngrad f: Um, it could be in \ngrad a: or in \nprofessor c: Semantically.\ngrad a: semantically.\ngrad f: semantically, yeah. Yeah.\ngrad a: So \ngrad f: So it uh, uh, a table. You know, a thing that c doesn't have a gender. So. Uh, it could be that I mean, maybe you 'd maybe not all these I mean, I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things.\ngrad a: No, just to make sure that we everybody that's completely agreed that it it has nothing to do with, uh, form.\ngrad f: Yeah. OK, that is semantic as opposed to Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Um.\ngrad a: Then \" predications \" makes sense to to have it open for something like, uh, accessibility or not.\ngrad f: S so again Open to various things.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad f: Right. OK, so. Let's see. So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment, should I just go through each of these slots uh, each of these blocks, um, a little bit?\ngrad e: Sure.\ngrad f: Um, mostly the top one is sort of image schematic. And just a note, which was that, um s so when we actually ha so for instance, um, some of them seem more inherently static, OK, like a container or sort of support - ish. And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like \" source, path, goal \" is often thought of that way or \" force \", or something like that. But in actual fact, I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that. And different X - schemas use them in a way that's either static or dynamic. So \" path \", you could just be talking about the path between this and this.\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad f: And you know, \" container \" that you can go in and out. All of these things. And so, um, I think this came up when, uh, Ben and I were working with the Spaniards, um, the other day the \" Spaniettes \", as we called them um, to decide like how you want to split up, like, s image schematic contributions versus, like, X - schematic contributions. How do you link them up. And I think again, um, it's gonna be something in the X - schema that tells you \" is this static or is this dynamic \". So we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that. Um, that, you know, is it, uh, a state or is it a change of state, or is it a, um, action of some kind?\ngrad a: Uh, i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't?\ngrad f: Uh.

{"fname": "product_dev_134", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Two. Yeah, if  Sorry.\nproject manager: You prefer it . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh as you know, I am mister Ramaro. I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators. So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control. Well, as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device, like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera. So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_. So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions, what we want on this portable device. And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface, which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that. And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device. It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information. Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want. So, basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want, and then we have some chip, it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format. And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device. Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations, and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things.\nproject manager: Okay. To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, because the people don't use one particular brand so\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: or at least we have more more than five brands, which are really good.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device. So we need to have particular encryption codes.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Then, components, so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device. Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components. And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard, or mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure, because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: we can have another, like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery, so this battery, once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nproject manager: On \nindustrial designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh train it, okay. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah, so that we just use simple recog\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Too complex.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: no but but \nmarketing: But uh very very good to sell. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. No, even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things, yeah.\nmarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them,\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control,\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: because it's targeted to me. Whatever. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And what about the price of this component?\nindustrial designer: So Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that,\nproject manager: It mm okay.\nmarketing: Hmm. Cheap.\nindustrial designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk,\nmarketing: Millions. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so we can make really simp\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and we want to make really simple device\nmarketing: Cheap.\nindustrial designer: because we have only very few words like like power, switch on or some like\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel, so users can listen.\nmarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: or or it will be something like volume, up, down.\nindustrial designer: Ye No, yeah, a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: With a keywords and yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase, so we try to only recognise those words\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm mm.\nindustrial designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nmarketing: Couple of words.\nindustrial designer: then it become more mechanical and yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Um.\nindustrial designer: And then we can have channel they can say, okay I want eight, because we don't know like users have different programmes, I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nmarketing: Of course uh it has to be \nindustrial designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem,\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: it's it it will be take care of our main mm.\nuser interface: No you know it's a conceptual question, 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it, volume up, volume up,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But then I think you you {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and and he's coming you know, he's really annoyed with this, down, up, down. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons.\nproject manager: No, in no not only speech, yeah.\nmarketing: It's on top of using the button.\nproject manager: I it's an option.\nuser interface: Okay, for this budget like twelve Euros.\nmarketing: Well, I dunno. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on, on and off, this processor and This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power, volume and this part and this D_S_P_s.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Again, this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form, like volume and like this key.\nuser interface: Okay..\nindustrial designer: So it may not be like very expensive, because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nmarketing: T_V_.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so and we have only few things here \nproject manager: Sho to to train, okay.\nuser interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Like, if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: roll 'em up\nindustrial designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nuser interface: or roll 'em down.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Very expensive,\nindustrial designer: because it's it's very expensive\nmarketing: no?\nindustrial designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nproject manager: And well, what about the idea of automatic on off on the button, yeah.\nuser interface: Mm why?\nindustrial designer: and \nuser interface: That's just \nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: And volume control.\nindustrial designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic, because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nmarketing: So but uh \nindustrial designer: and \nmarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control. We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yay yeah. Yeah that can be possible, especially for power settings, so user can say okay, suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I \nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: Wouldn't that make uh arguments?\nindustrial designer: They can make \nmarketing: Yeah, of course.\nproject manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah we can have \nmarketing: That's no problem, we will sell more. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And we can increase this the strength\nuser interface: We got a really good Market Expert.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah exactly.\nproject manager: y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Let's send more, let's sell more.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay. You have mm something else to say? Uh.\nindustrial designer: Uh, not very much,\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: like yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Thanks.\nproject manager: Okay, thanks.\nindustrial designer: Thank you. Yep. Thank you.\nproject manager: So\nindustrial designer: Can you just yeah.\nproject manager: mm\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: mm I think, okay, we're just on time. Um mm mm. So, we're now going to l have the lunch break.\nmarketing: Mm great. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work, and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting, and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so uh you will focus on the component concept um\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah.\nproject manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nindustrial designer: Mark will \nproject manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching. So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach. Well I think that's all. And we have um maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's in current price, yeah.\nmarketing: Difficult.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But speech recogniser can be possible.\nproject manager: Yeah, implemented. O okay, we can think about that.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: And um do you see something else?\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Uh, should it be equipped with the uh, with uh speakers?\nmarketing: Speakers in the remote cont\nuser interface: Like, you want to find it, you shout\nmarketing: Oh yeah.\nproject manager: Uh yeah\nuser interface: control,\nproject manager: that's \nuser interface: and it answers is I'm here? Or \nmarketing: It just beeps.\nuser interface: Just beeps?\nmarketing: That would be enough.\nproject manager: Or maybe you want to phone him.\nmarketing: Something very cheap.\nproject manager: Since now all \nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah.\nmarketing: But that's ex that's expensive. Uh.\nproject manager: yeah? Think\nindustrial designer: Yeah, especially the power, it really consumes\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: because it should be all the time on and \nproject manager: And uh \nmarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they \nproject manager: And it's answered.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: I can't whistle. No, no, I can't.\nmarketing: You can't whistle. Uh-huh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Or a clap. You can clap. Can you?\nproject manager: Clap clap clap it's a good \nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Clap is good.\nproject manager: I I think it's universal.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Tak\nproject manager: What about people without hand?\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Just a suggestion.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think it's good.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: With only one hand? These are not our target people. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm uh okay.\nindustrial designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.

{"fname": "product_dev_114", "dialogue": "project manager: Now let's talk about uh interface.\nuser interface: Okay. Uh participant number three.\nproject manager: Three.\nindustrial designer: Three.\nuser interface: Uh\nproject manager: Which one? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: mm mm uh have a look at this \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: no it's yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh so the concept of the interface. Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface, but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls. So let's start with this. We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and uh we got explanation for every button\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button, I don't know really where it is, maybe one of this buttons, and um power on and off mm I I don't remember\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off? Or no? I can see nothing. So that's our concept. It's called the millennium remote control.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Let's change millenniums. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: maybe you can use in the end and {vocalsound}\nmarketing: doesn't make sense. This is very ugly.\nuser interface: Really? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I thought you like it. Ah okay\nmarketing: Oh no,\nuser interface: just press the button, please uh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: too much concept.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Ah.\nindustrial designer: Uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, we will not use this. We will not use this.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But instead of this I will devise That's our concept.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah, back today. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And it's got just few buttons, quite low looking, and all this stuff we already we already discussed.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. 'Kay.\nuser interface: And uh what will people say? They'll say it's perfect. Or what will say? Uh they will say it's splendid. And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Do you think it can come in several colours?\nuser interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied.\nmarketing: Or did the \nuser interface: I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours.\nmarketing: Um but not the case.\nuser interface: Not the case.\nmarketing: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: like \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Because apparently from your survey people like colours, no?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, well they like uh something which is uh \nuser interface: Okay, so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels.\nmarketing: Mm yeah, okay,\nuser interface: Do you like it?\nmarketing: so that would be the option. I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's uh \nmarketing: but I don't use that but again, uh I might \nuser interface: That's why you don't have it. That's why,\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: 'cause it's nasty. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: bu but {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly.\nuser interface: Um, I am here.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So users have different I mean they have their own interests, colour interests and so \nproject manager: So?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So we can just if they want they can just pay another two Euro.\nproject manager: Uh-huh, okay, so\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah yeah yes. If they want like uh so that we can yeah.\nmarketing: Kind of upgradable uh remote control.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Wow, wow.\nindustrial designer: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours.\nuser interface: Okay, what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact, um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, and depending on the temperature,\nindustrial designer: Lights, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: And thermodynamic also. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Like a chameleon.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah.\nuser interface: We can make it in fact.\nproject manager: Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive, yeah.\nuser interface: If if if the \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: okay.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,\nproject manager: but \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: so \nmarketing: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people. Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature. My remote control is pink. Nobody else than me has a pink remote control.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And that makes me special.\nproject manager: Okay\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that.\nproject manager: Okay, so\nmarketing: Those who wanted to have it pink.\nproject manager: so i it's not uh a s base service\nindustrial designer: Uh \nmarketing: No mm no.\nproject manager: it's a \nuser interface: So,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: be an option,\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: yeah.\nmarketing: It might be optional, yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: But those people will be really few, no? So like we can those \nmarketing: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends.\nindustrial designer: Ah.\nmarketing: Although similar but have something just slightly better. Pink {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: So m so\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah,\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah. But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time.\nproject manager: And you'll be different.\nuser interface: And it makes you different,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: you know?\nmarketing: You always have your remote.\nproject manager: Uh in the train uh, hello uh no. Want to change my neighbour.\nuser interface: Anyone has their remote controls here?\nmarketing: Oh, you don't? Yeah. You don't have your remo {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod. It's a kind of remote control. Uh it's white\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control. White.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Could we integrate something into our remote control, something like light?\nmarketing: Seems important.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: That they can use it in darkness, like. Hand light,\nmarketing: Mm glow in the dark,\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nmarketing: so \nindustrial designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so that like at least um \nproject manager: Iradium? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah sorry. Mm.\nindustrial designer: that \nproject manager: Okay. So mm \nuser interface: Okay. S well,\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: let's go on maybe with the presentation.\nmarketing: Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And um the remote control's going to be smart\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nuser interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And uh\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I dunno\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that's a question to you and to mm to \nmarketing: Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition.\nuser interface: Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I dunno. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm, that's a nice world. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So just just just just think about it um.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Thank you.\nmarketing: Don't touch the remote.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: But yeah. Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want.\nuser interface: Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart.\nmarketing: Like with some Maybe fingerprint recognition or \nuser interface: Voice recognition is quite tough. I say don't use it, and the control just looks.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it.\nmarketing: Um Mm.\nindustrial designer: Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess, like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use \nmarketing: Okay. So it could be smart in that way.\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm. Okay.\nmarketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have. S since it it knows who is using it, it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah, sure.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and provide you ways of using them, I dunno, somehow,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I dunno, that might be expensive\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: but\nindustrial designer: Uh it's \nmarketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: The remote that knows you. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, thanks.", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion about user interface concept.", "zh_query": "总结与会成员讨论的用户界面概念。", "fr_query": "Résumez la discussion sur le concept d'interface utilisateur.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте обговорення концепції інтерфейсу користувача.", "en_summary": "The user interface designer presented a good-looking design with few buttons.

Don't throw anything away.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Uh just we can start a new one, and we just go on, and don't throw anything away.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just uh let them all uh stand here. We can delete, but we don't do that. Um you can here select a pen, you can draw anything you want. It's a bit uh childish you have to write. It's not as fast as you w you know it, but it does work sometimes.\nindustrial designer: .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well it's just like a normal uh paint.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's gone.\nindustrial designer: Alright, yep.\nproject manager: Well we are designers, so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard. So that's fantastic. Um well this uh speaks for itself. We going to try it. So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: not my idea. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Alright, your favourite animal? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes our your favourite. So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but I'm going d I'm not going to. I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast\nmarketing: Grizzly bear. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: w I dunno what I'm going to design.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh um doesn't oh.\nindustrial designer: I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh \nproject manager: Yeah, 'kay. Hmm?\nindustrial designer: I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I just said it's not my idea\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: but I am the Project Manager,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and officially this is my idea. So {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I I I I understand. Alright.\nmarketing: We're kinda losing time, though.\nproject manager: what?\nmarketing: We're losing time, but \nproject manager: Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose, loosen up, a bit uh meeting each other\nindustrial designer: so start \nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: well uh uh nice yeah. Sh\nindustrial designer: Yep yes.\nproject manager: I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh \nindustrial designer: Don't uh count on it.\nproject manager: No so a a few legs.\nmarketing: Do we have to guess?\nproject manager: Yes yes\nmarketing: A hippo? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: guess. Well I should make it an hippo now. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think it's a mouse or a rat.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: No I don't think so.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh. Oh I know it.\nproject manager: Well what is it, huh?\nindustrial designer: It's a hedgehog.\nmarketing: I don't know how to call it.\nproject manager: Yeah\nmarketing: A hedgehog? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: difficult English word. I didn't knew it myself . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: .\nindustrial designer: Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Our characteristics sum it up. Well it's uh very uh painful\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: those kind of thing. So we can uh just uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We're going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal.\nindustrial designer: I am the Industrial Designer.\nmarketing: Alright. Thank you.\nproject manager: Huh.\nindustrial designer: Chief, I am the Industrial Designer.\nproject manager: Oh uh but this uh marketing designer.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: \nmarketing: It's . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: what kind of animal is that then? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think can I say it?\nmarketing: Yeah sure.\nproject manager: Uh it . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's a rabbit. Well Looks very nice, right?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It looks amazing.\nproject manager: No no no. What are you going to do? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We want to erase it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No no.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No no save it and start a new uh save it and start a new black uh doc a blank document.\nindustrial designer: These are very impor {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: These are very important documents, of course, uh these drawings, uh \nproject manager: Yeah well we have to save everything\nmarketing: Yes uh right.\nproject manager: so now um the next one uh  and then save it and start an blank document.\nuser interface: Thanks.\nmarketing: You go man.\nproject manager: Yeah. There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness.\nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: So um well you should uh try it but uh \nmarketing: I should have made mine a white rabbit. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well y y y you could have but uh.\nindustrial designer: And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for.\nproject manager: It speaks for itself.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What the {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It looks like an uh \nproject manager: uh just a duck. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It looks like that beast from Sesame Street.\nproject manager: Nice. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Big bird. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Is it a duck?\nmarketing: You're standing in front of it,\nindustrial designer: It's it's uh \nproject manager: Is it a plane? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I can't see it. Alright, thank you. Yeah it's a bird, but what kind of bird?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh.\nindustrial designer: Do we have to uh \nmarketing: You have to push harder.\nproject manager: Yeah just a bit a bit childish,\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: a bit.\nindustrial designer: But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird?\nmarketing: Release your anger.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh no I don't.\nindustrial designer: No?\nuser interface: It's just a bird.\nproject manager: Well uh save the document\nindustrial designer: Well wonderful.\nproject manager: and then uh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And then a a new blank document for . uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it.\nuser interface: Here you go.\nindustrial designer: Why do I have to do the difficult tasks?\nproject manager: No well first\nindustrial designer: Uh pen \nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah that's .\nproject manager: And then you go to format I think, and current colour \nindustrial designer: Uh current colour.\nproject manager: you choose a new colour. And a new pen width uh also format.\nindustrial designer: I like uh \nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: oh they don't have pink. Oh b oh think this is uh \nproject manager: It's not like in paint. Line width.\nindustrial designer: Uh? Uh \nproject manager: And you can choose a nice one.\nindustrial designer: Line width.\nproject manager: Width width.\nuser interface: Width.\nproject manager: With each other.\nindustrial designer: Uh fifteen.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: And I can draw?\nproject manager: Yeah. So. Just a wa that's the way we do \nindustrial designer: Uh \nproject manager: it's quite easy.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's a pussy cat.\nmarketing: It's a cat. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh Pussy. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh the line width is too thick, but oh well.\nproject manager: Well then you change it. And erase things.\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: What? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's a pig. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It smiles nicely.\nproject manager: Super pig. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Now I have to change the line width. Uh one .\nproject manager: So Yeah yeah yeah\nindustrial designer: These are whiskers, you know.\nproject manager: we know. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: Uh well I think it's obvious right now.\nproject manager: Yes alright. It's a cat. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No it looks great.\nindustrial designer: Miaow.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well if this isn't obvious \nproject manager: Well well um \nmarketing: Just save it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah save it and start a new blank document.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I'll save it alright uh save. Uh yeah uh blank.\nproject manager: Yep. So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it.\nindustrial designer: Well I feel comfortable now.\nmarketing: Oh great.\nproject manager: Well it's terrific, eh? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Thanks for this exercise. I feel totally at ease.\nmarketing: It's good for group spirit. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah that's it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It certainly is. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We're one big happy family now. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah something like that.\nproject manager: Well then uh the serious uh stuff. We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars, but uh twenty five Euros. Our profit aim is, worldwide, fifty million Euros. So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell.\nindustrial designer: So {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so, keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff, and uh marketing uh research.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls, first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera?\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait. We can uh take notes and uh Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls? Please? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh \nproject manager: No uh I did. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's not, it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls, but uh \nproject manager: Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then \nmarketing: I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah yeah.\nmarketing: On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce.\nproject manager: Yep. That's alright.\nmarketing: Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player\nproject manager: That would be a nice idea, yes.\nmarketing: so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control.\nproject manager: Yep yep yep.\nmarketing: Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world, for different cultures, maybe, because we want to we want to well fifty million?\nproject manager: Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit, so.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so a lot of people have to be able to use it.\nindustrial designer: No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh\nmarketing: So \nuser interface: Easy to learn.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah that's right.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and numbers and uh that every culture in uh, yeah, people in every country can recognise.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: I also think we should not add too many buttons.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: No that's right.\nuser interface: Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think.\nproject manager: Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's \nuser interface: Precisely.\nproject manager: culture uh international.\nmarketing: Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah indeed.\nindustrial designer: Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh \nmarketing: Yeah right.\nproject manager: Yep, and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player. Don't we have uh other uh ou\nuser interface: Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use, we uh we make?\nproject manager: Uh.\nindustrial designer: And stereo uh s uh audio installations.\nproject manager: We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw.\nmarketing: Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep.\nuser interface: And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes. So we can keep that in mind.\nindustrial designer: Most people do, yeah.\nproject manager: Well yeah.\nindustrial designer: It doesn't \nproject manager: It doesn't have to be, but we can.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it doesn't have to be \nuser interface: W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it.\nproject manager: Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_.\nmarketing: Yeah but \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah alright, but \nmarketing: We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh \nproject manager: Yeah because we look at competitors\nindustrial designer: Well.\nproject manager: and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah but it's it has to be useable.\nindustrial designer: It has to be different and familiar at the same time.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: we could use another form or shape or colour, that kind of things.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: yeah the shape will will have to be recognised. I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: you can make it uh triangle shaped,\nuser interface: Well we we could make more more oval or something, and and \nindustrial designer: but that's not uh very recognisable.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Oo\nindustrial designer: Oval?\nproject manager: N we can use uh it as a as a game pad.\nuser interface: Yeah or so\nindustrial designer: I \nproject manager: So one hand has the beer, so the other hand uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well yeah it's new. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: . Not with two hands. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah, right.\nuser interface: but young people want something different\nmarketing: No {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and it is \nproject manager: Well i we already uh \nmarketing: Yeah but it's quite important that it fits.\nproject manager: one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Oh but it ha it has to be m\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah. But you still have to know it's a remote and not another \nproject manager: Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh\nuser interface: Yeah alright.\nproject manager: because it's a long time uh on the market. So the the form will have been uh tested out so \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh, yeah, useful\nproject manager: Yes. Well {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: or else uh they would have been ano another shape.\nproject manager: for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them. I have uh have to it has to fit my hands.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah\nmarketing: It shouldn't be boxy.\nindustrial designer: a lo the long box shape yeah. You have to use one hand.\nproject manager: It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb.\nmarketing: Nah I don't agree with the long box uh shape {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Why not?\nmarketing: it it has to be custom made for the hand.\nuser interface: Yeah it doesn't fit .\nproject manager: Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this, and you can make it another shape,\nmarketing: Yeah but if you shape it \nindustrial designer: but then you have \nuser interface: No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped.\nmarketing: If \nproject manager: D_V_D_ players. Yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: W no w what else?\nmarketing: No that's ol old fashioned.\nindustrial designer: I di\nuser interface: Well Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then?\nuser interface: Yes uh \nmarketing: I can imagine that us\nuser interface: Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end, and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end.\nmarketing: Yeah right. It fits in your palms.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Well {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but it's still then uh the the long box, uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand,\nuser interface: Yeah it \nproject manager: Well \nmarketing: Hmm?\nproject manager: A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand.\nmarketing: Um.\nindustrial designer: but it's it's still Yeah yeah al alright\nproject manager: That's \nindustrial designer: but but it's still it's still sort of box, yeah.\nmarketing: .\nuser interface: Yeah yea\nindustrial designer: It it has round forms\nmarketing: Well \nindustrial designer: but it in the end it's still the box, so that's what I mean.\nmarketing: Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah I understand, but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square\nmarketing: It shouldn't be too boxy, you know.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: It's \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No no no.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but a also with round edges of course,\nuser interface: .\nindustrial designer: but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right maybe something like this\nindustrial designer: Yeah yes {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player\nindustrial designer: I thought about something like that. Yeah.\nmarketing: and so you can I've \nindustrial designer: A big recognisable button on top or something.\nmarketing: Yeah right, and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: We have five minutes left.\nindustrial designer: The buttons should uh also be not too small, not too big, of course,\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes\nindustrial designer: and uh n uh uh not too close uh together.\nproject manager: uh that's yep.\nmarketing: But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: So there has to be some space between the buttons.\nindustrial designer: Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah right right,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and maybe we should use colours.\nuser interface: Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them,\nindustrial designer: Colours, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Ha.\nuser interface: and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's kinda trendy. Yeah right.\nproject manager: Sound nice. Yes.\nuser interface: I dunno but \nindustrial designer: I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um \nproject manager: Well it's just uh about our first ideas now\nuser interface: Well {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: .\nproject manager: so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. But \nproject manager: Yes?\nindustrial designer: Already thought about something tha {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make,\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: so we \nproject manager: Well thirty minutes we have. So um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh. You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh. I think.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: .\nmarketing: No problem.\nproject manager: Oh and uh that's uh that's all. So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over.\nindustrial designer: Yeah now we can still talk about the material,\nproject manager: Yeah yes say.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course, hard plastic, the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy.\nuser interface: .\nproject manager: Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons\nuser interface: .\nindustrial designer: No n n\nproject manager: and when I've had use it much it was gone. So it has to be made in the buttons I think.\nuser interface: Yeah that's bad, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: It has to uh not be loose.\nuser interface: Yeah that's important .\nindustrial designer: Mm. Alright. And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other.\nproject manager: Yeah. Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh \nindustrial designer: I think so.\nmarketing: Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's a a common stan standard way \nproject manager: It's not that in China it's different?\nmarketing: Yep.\nindustrial designer: infrared beams an infrared beam I think .\nproject manager: Yeah. But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between \nmarketing: And you can use \nindustrial designer: It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country, so \nproject manager: Probably yes.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: China rules. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works. The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But are \nindustrial designer: but that's pretty obvious, I think. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea?\nproject manager: Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes.\nmarketing: I think we should make it universal\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and you can always use a front front on it, you know? You can use it just plain\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: .\nmarketing: but you can To make it more trendy.\nproject manager: Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it, but you can change them uh when you buy the \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Yes. Yes.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh \nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Well you can make profit with them, and it's a way to make them trendy.\nproject manager: Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh.\nindustrial designer: Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something\nuser interface: Yeah alright.\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: Yeah normal.\nindustrial designer: uh b a simple colour not not very flashy.\nproject manager: Yes. Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell,\nuser interface: No a colour everyone accepts.\nproject manager: so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so \nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Pink television sets pink remote, .\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. standard.\nmarketing: But people of often don't like bright colours or something.\nproject manager: .\nmarketing: We have to make it grey or s or black.\nuser interface: Well young people s li\nmarketing: Yeah but then you can use a a front.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I must not forget my pen the next time. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well if if you yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it. I think.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah that's right.\nproject manager: But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah or a t Teletubby front. Yeah yeah yeah. I will investigate.\nproject manager: Yes. Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be, but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote. And you will look into the technical design and um form, I think.\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task, yeah.\nproject manager: Or something like that. Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get \nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I uh w was wondering that too.\nproject manager: Euro?\nindustrial designer: Y you went to the company website .\nmarketing: It's Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer \nproject manager: Well it it it's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: if you uh \nindustrial designer: It's the the the start uh starting page uh \nuser interface: Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it .\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Finish meeting now. Oh alright. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so \nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Well that's great.\nuser interface: Next meeting is in \nproject manager: In thirty minutes, but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here.\nuser interface: Thirty minutes.\nmarketing: Thirty minutes.\nuser interface: Yeah alright it's it's handy to know \nproject manager: I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh\nindustrial designer: Very handy to know.\nmarketing: It's totally broken. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: because uh it's it's the half of the normal size. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right see you in half an hour then.\nproject manager: Oh right, oh.\nuser interface: Oh. Goodbye. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ma {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: W\nmarketing: Oh \nuser interface: S\nproject manager: W that was a nice meeting.\nmarketing: .\nuser interface: .\nindustrial designer: Right uh see you in thirty minutes then. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, see you. {vocalsound}", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

Twenty five Euro for a remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah, mm that's the price we want to \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: that's the aim for the price for the remote control.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: We aim to do this profit. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: On the international market.\nmarketing: 'tis big number.\nproject manager: Yeah. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we're to sell two million then.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Wow.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum. 'Kay. So any of you have experience in remote controls? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: Uh yes, we have plenty at home.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: In fact, my daughter likes l remote controls.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That \nuser interface: Mm. To eat? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: To eat? Yeah, mainly, and to break. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So that could be a great um application.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Remote controls children proof. Mm mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Children proof.\nmarketing: Ye ye yeah.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: So she likes uh buttons which make click,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, pret\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so it has to click.\nproject manager: So they have to be waterproof maybe?\nmarketing: It has to be uh wha baby proof {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'Cause they eat she ate it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: yeah but mainly it has to be very robust\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Ah.\nmarketing: So it has to be very robust.\nuser interface: Okay, unbreakable.\nmarketing: Unbreakable, yeah.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we have some child lock or something, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: And uh it has to be nice looking,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: colourful, maybe \nproject manager: Colourful, yeah mm.\nuser interface: Colourful? That's not practical.\nmarketing: colourful, because uh nobody has colourful remote control\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: No, that's a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's always black or yeah.\nmarketing:, they're always black, yeah,\nproject manager: Mm mm-mm.\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: but this one could be I dunno, purple or b\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But how gonna okay, just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: No,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: because you think, why not.\nuser interface: Otherwise you will never find it.\nmarketing: One colour.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah even we can change colours, no? Like the uh\nmarketing: Oh like the phones,\nindustrial designer: like the phones and these things we c yeah.\nmarketing: yeah, it could change colours, yeah.\nuser interface: Cool.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: At least for children like one colour and . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Ch\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good idea.\nmarketing: Good.\nindustrial designer: And it should be really small and .\nproject manager: Small also? Don't you think \nindustrial designer: Huh not so big like yeah.\nproject manager: No uh, not too much buttons or mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, not too much buttons and \nmarketing: Should it be, y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television, then it's the remote control for the the sound system, or for your refrigerator\nindustrial designer: Uh. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: whatever {vocalsound}\nproject manager: that's \nmarketing: I dunno if it's \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Or if we should have a targeted re remote control.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: So colour, robustness, easy to use, size,\nproject manager: So, I think there's \nmarketing: yeah, size matters, yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Colour, size, sh\nproject manager: So you you think it's better if small than bigger.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah, but without any extremes like n not of this size, not too large. Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No, not too small, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like .\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, like a palm sized.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Just to hold it.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: But uh what would be different from this, from the others? I dunno if \nindustrial designer: Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. Mm. S so then it depends \nmarketing: Yeah, at least the colour would be different.\nindustrial designer: you are to \nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame .\nmarketing: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow,\nproject manager: Mm. So, some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what \nmarketing: I dunno .\nuser interface: No,\nproject manager: no.\nuser interface: no screens, it's too complex.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Too expensive, yeah.\nmarketing: Too expensive for twelve Euro?\nuser interface: And n maybe not too expensive,\nproject manager: And too expensive.\nuser interface: well it's not my problem, but well okay.\nmarketing: Ah.\nuser interface: But no screens on remote controls.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right,\nindustrial designer: Ye yeah.\nmarketing: so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control,\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: if you if you like.\nindustrial designer: I mean it it's like\nmarketing: I don't know if it makes sense, but \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: it's like two types no? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this, say if you're right handed you use like this\nmarketing: Yeah, for instance, mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm.\nindustrial designer: or so tha your switch on and off should be on\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So adaptable yeah something \nuser interface: Adaptable. Alright, good,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Maybe, if if it's possible, yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so how many actions do we need to implement in it?\nindustrial designer: huh.\nuser interface: On off?\nindustrial designer: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We can adapt only one switch, suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations.\nuser interface: I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: Three buttons you mean?\nuser interface: like three mental states,\nproject manager: Three option.\nuser interface: yeah you know what I mean,\nmarketing: Ah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: we can just make it uh\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Um.\nuser interface: controlled by a brain, huh? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm, yeah, sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe if it's more, if there is a software inside\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: that ask you three \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: \nproject manager: If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button, three mm possibilities, ye yeah.\nuser interface: Sh sure, sure.\nmarketing: Yeah, more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time.\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else.\nmarketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You do this?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh no.\nuser interface: I usually just change channels.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Because I'm only using three or four channels but {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit.\nproject manager: Yeah. I change channel like this, m uh I want to go to twenty five, and then to ten, uh-huh mm yeah.\nindustrial designer: Dash.\nmarketing: And then back to the one I was before,\nproject manager: Also we can be here \nmarketing: so there's whichever it was.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you can\nproject manager: yeah, that would be cool.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: Go back button is good.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Uh uh we had that in in other countries.\nuser interface: I once had it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, the previous button is .\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh, okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: History. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh uh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions,\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: that becomes more complex,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, what the which channels the viewer {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nmarketing: Yeah {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: maybe it's a \nproject manager: So I think we have full of idea.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones, make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want. And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do. Um. So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes.\nmarketing: So what does M_E_ means? M_E_ the user requirements? Or that's uh that's for us?\nuser interface: Market Expert.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Marketing yeah .\nmarketing: Uh that's me.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh, of course yeah, the user requirement specifications, uh-huh, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay. I'll think of that.\nproject manager: Mm okay. So.\nmarketing: So?\nproject manager: I think that's all.\nmarketing: Meeting's over?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Great.\nindustrial designer: Thank you.\nmarketing: Thank you.\nproject manager: See you in thirty minutes.\nuser interface: Thank you everybody.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "The main points of the discussion are the design goal and price of a new television remote control project.

{"fname": "product_dev_9", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Okay. So do I unplug this bit here?\nproject manager: Oh, right yeah.\nmarketing: Gotta plug you in.\nproject manager: Yep. Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up. Yep. Cool.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Right. That's page one of my presentation.\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nmarketing: Very nice. For your first PowerPoint it's lovely.\nindustrial designer: So the uh method. We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project. Um remote control works as follows. This is all pretty basic stuff you guys. Um sends message to another system, so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power, something along those lines, there's an integrated circuit, which is the microchip, um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. A user interface controls the chip, basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well. So my findings, um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands. And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like, and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer, just think of those lawsuits, that'd be really bad.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction. Um, components. Just some ideas that I had, um, energy source, it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. Um the user interface, I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: The chip, um, silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that, we can't really be different in that respect. Um, the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard, multi channel, that's a word I made up, I don't really know what it means.\nproject manager: 'Kay. Fair enough.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices. Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s. Um personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal, um, the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nmarketing: Fine.\nindustrial designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value,\nproject manager: Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers, or mo modern types of plastics\nindustrial designer: 'cause we were thinking \nproject manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: It needs, yeah.\nproject manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with?\nindustrial designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem. Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do.\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: That's the end of my presentation.\nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Great. Thank you very much Nathan. Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: S plug yourself in here. Mm. Um hit function F_ eight real quickly, hold down Mm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Looks like you're in okay.\nindustrial designer: Is it plugged in well? There it goes. Computer adjusting.\nuser interface: Th\nproject manager: There you go. Sweet.\nmarketing: There you go.\nuser interface: Well so. Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation. Um so a few of the requirements we need here. Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device, it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem.\nproject manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before.\nuser interface: Um so some of my findings. Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set. Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television, uh switch to the next channel, that sort of thing, I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does. Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well\nproject manager: Oh yeah look at that.\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it. As you also notice it's quite a boring design. Um. Another remote control, slightly different, it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions, um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use. Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring. So\nproject manager: Nice.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: my personal preferences.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control. Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with. And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Um. Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh .\nproject manager: Great. Thanks for that Ron.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: 'Kay\nmarketing: Does that mean I'm up?\nproject manager: yep that's you.\nmarketing: I think so. Okay.\nuser interface: I can plug you in.\nmarketing: Oh that would be perfect. Thank you. Slide show up and running.\nproject manager: Give it a little bit.\nmarketing: Or not. Uh. Oh there we go. Perfect. Okay. So this is me. Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices. Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's used to using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, m the majority of the time that's all that's going on, the other functions happen, for some people they're important, but the primary uses are really really basic. Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use, they're not using a lot of it, they don't need it, they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with. And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people, their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, will really come into play with a lot of these people. Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful, and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically, that's up to the design people, but it is s something worth thinking about, especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing, so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about. Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards. So it's a good start for us.\nproject manager: That's great. Thank you Sarah. Right. So um\nmarketing: Need to unplug this?\nproject manager: yep I'll just uh switch that back here.\nmarketing: Need it back.\nproject manager: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase.\nmarketing: There you go.\nproject manager: Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Um Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to, you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted, thought about voice control,\nmarketing: Oh right.\nproject manager: um so do we wanna go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic, and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. Um.

{"fname": "product_dev_22", "dialogue": "marketing: That went well, thank you.\nproject manager: That's great.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Perfect.\nproject manager: Alright, let me just PowerPoint this up. Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design, don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is, it's just something important that we need to do. Um, think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete. In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype. Um. Right so um, apologies for the last meeting, it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough, um, so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting. Um, fair enough, thanks for the input,'s always good. Um.

And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work. So, perfect. So, without th further ado, whoever wants to go first is free to.\nindustrial designer: I'll go first.\nproject manager: Alright Nathan,\nmarketing: Go ahead.\nproject manager: take it away. It is Nathan right? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again?\nindustrial designer: No Nathan's fine.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good.\nindustrial designer: It's either Nathan or participant two.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mister participant two that is. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nice.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um,\nproject manager: Nice.\nindustrial designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: so Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that. Um, components of a remote control, okay. We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon. Energy source, um, our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources, your standard battery, solar cells. Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route, we might have to look elsewhere. Um, and also there's a kinetic energy possibility. Basically, it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running. So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: So we'll have to look into that.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Um, the case, we have a few options, plastic, rubber or wood. Um and then as far as the way it's shaped, we can do standard boring flat, which we probably don't wanna do, curved or very sexy double curved.\nproject manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at?\nindustrial designer: Um, I imagine that we could specify. Um, I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres. Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, brilliant.\nindustrial designer: Um, the buttons, there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer, but to use those we'd have to use more chips, um and that would cost us more. And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um and just a little note there,\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. Nice.\nindustrial designer: Um, one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum. So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that. And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light. Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote, just kind of as a fun gimmick.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it.\nmarketing: Interesting.\nindustrial designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that.\nproject manager: M Maybe \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm. Good call.\nproject manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Choose it.\nindustrial designer: I am sure that we could do that. Um, of course \nproject manager: Yeah I like the idea, it's a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just as a fun gimmick.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Just to set us apart a little bit. Um, and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use, also known as the chip. Uh, we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um findings, okay, we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer, um and my question to all of you is, should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available?\nuser interface: Interesting question.\nindustrial designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints, is that really a feasible option?\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right, that's my concern too. Um, if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer. My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table, uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route, just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on. Uh, I like the idea of the visible light signalling, that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes. So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know, say our the one \nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Can we do marketing piloting too? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received?\nmarketing: Um It's an option, uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nproject manager: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand,\nproject manager: Okay, perfect.\nmarketing: it may help us decide for now. Temporarily anyway.\nproject manager: Great, thank you very much Nathan.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, you're welcome.\nproject manager: That's perfect, so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here.\nmarketing: I guess so, 'cause I found some interesting things. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Did you? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You waiting for me? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Fascinating, compelling even.\nmarketing: I know, what a teaser ain't it. Um. Right. So\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: current market trends. Screen. Um, basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields, to see sort of what's what's trendy, what's new, what's happening. Um, remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer, fancier, more exciting they're sick of this boring, normal, functional, um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface. Um the challenge is that current trends right now, across the board in fashion, in furniture, in technology, is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Now I'm not saying we should have, you know, tomato shaped remote controls or anything, but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours, like if wood is an option, that whole organic, sleek, clean,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: v line thing may be something we can look into. Different skin options, or if we can't afford this touch plate thing, or touch face screen interface um, maybe having the b images be specific, like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nproject manager: Tomatoes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: a different shape\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: or okay, not the example I would choose, but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I like it, I like it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: uh not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting, I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin, but like a holder almost if you could do like um, leather options or wood options or something \nindustrial designer: Hmm. I should have mentioned this um. As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Mm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Slick, slick.\nuser interface: Fabulous.\nmarketing: Might be an interesting way to go. Um, yeah so something to sit on for now. So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding, everyone's looking for easy to use, technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Um.\nproject manager: Interface, oh the interface graphics for the um \nmarketing: Yeah. Um. Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable, something that you can drop and it doesn't matter.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: 'Cause so many \nmarketing: True.\nindustrial designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls.\nmarketing: Very true. Very true.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's like, yep {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you,\nmarketing: Very much so. Um\nindustrial designer: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber.\nproject manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it?\nuser interface: We can have a duck tape casing.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We could.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something, a new line,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It could go with the granola crowd.\nmarketing: but worth a shot.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah, it could be, it could be,\nproject manager: Great,\nmarketing: um. Yeah that's what I know.\nproject manager: thanks for that Sarah.\nmarketing: No problem.\nproject manager: Ron?\nuser interface: Phew. Computer's adjusting. One moment please. So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So yur user interface, guys, is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear, or otherwise uh perceive. Uh, commands and mechanisms, that basically user uses to control the operator operating system. Here's a d series of different remote controls\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that are out on the market today. I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look.\nproject manager: Yeah\nuser interface: Um, so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts. Uh voice recognition, we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment. Um, so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples, um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control. Now our design team, research team, has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses. Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice, Good morning Joe. Um.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nuser interface: On the remote control\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: at the {vocalsound}\nuser interface: right.\nmarketing: Yeah. Very true, very true.\nuser interface: Um, another concept is what uh Apple has come up with, the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: which I am sure most of you know about.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button, kind of like a modern a bit bulky, a bit crazy,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: I don't think that's we're necessarily going for.\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: And uh some special components, uh ideas like uh blocking, having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue. Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose.\nproject manager: Yeah, I can see. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, again probably not what we're going for\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas. Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nmarketing: Mm, right.\nuser interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line. Uh touch screen interface, um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen, uh, the important ones like power, volume and jump between channels. Um, and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power, um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: has jokes when it's ready.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nice.\nproject manager: Great.\nuser interface: And uh that is about it.\nproject manager: Great, wonderful Ron, cool. Lot of good ideas, good facts to have.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: That's what they need, it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time, just connect it, my kingdom.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Right so, good to know all that stuff, thanks guys, um. Now we kind of have to come to some decisions, um, I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it. Um. Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think, I dunno, what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point?\nmarketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places.\nproject manager: 'Kay. 'Kay.\nmarketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be, that would be a really main cost source then\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: right?\nindustrial designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote,\nproject manager: To produce each one.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Per?\nindustrial designer: yeah that's just an estimate though.\nmarketing: Piece.\nuser interface: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I know\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: You industrial designers. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I know.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: It's fun. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty?\nproject manager: Well.\nmarketing: Do we remember?\nindustrial designer: I thought there was some flexibility with that.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: There is, it's just, it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money.\nmarketing: Can we justify it?\nproject manager: Um, from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five. If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: So \nuser interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers?\nindustrial designer: That's just off the top of my head,\nproject manager: From the board,\nindustrial designer: it is pending further emails. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: um, well \nmarketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote, you're gonna expect it to do something \nproject manager: That's true, I mean \nindustrial designer: It is the new it would be in a class of its own.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know, mass sales anyway, we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things, we just couldn't, not for twenty-five Euros,\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five, sell 'em for thirty, but that's something that we can have finance deal with. Um, I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron?\nuser interface: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production, my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh \nmarketing: See if we can cut some corners.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option, and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: It's true.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on \nmarketing: Right. It's a starting point anyway, so.\nproject manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen, you know, there's always the opportunity, if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever, you know, w we yeah, I guess we can play around with it a bit. Alright, let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So \nuser interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points, I think that our casing and the voice recognition \nmarketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote.\nproject manager: The voice rec thing,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean, if if we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec.\nmarketing: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: To be honest, we have the capa we have the design in-house,\nmarketing: Price-wise.\nuser interface: I mean we've we've come up with this, with this new voice \nmarketing: True.\nuser interface: we're using it for our coffee machines already.\nmarketing: We've already got it.\nuser interface: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall. Sounds good.\nproject manager: Hmm. What do you think on it Nathan? About the voice rec?\nindustrial designer: I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically. It would be very nice.\nmarketing: Pretty much.\nuser interface: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say.\nmarketing: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition. Course, maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option, but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Does having both really up our costs?\nproject manager: I can't see how it wouldn't, I mean, there's you know the old aphorism, you can have it fast, you can have it cheap or you can have it quality, pick two of three. You know, you can't you can't have all three.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function.\nproject manager: It's just impossible.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two. Um. Otherwise, yeah, we just it just becomes cost prohibitive. What which, which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to?\nmarketing: Well, we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent. But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model.\nindustrial designer: I would have to side with that,\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler, we already have the all the technology in-house, it's ready to go, it's packaged, it's \nproject manager: What does the cost look like Ron? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen?\nuser interface: Well my p is \nproject manager: Nathan?\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Um, this is just off the top of my head keep in mind, but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up, but um, since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up, if you know what I mean.\nproject manager: Right.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, I definitely have to agree with that last comment.\nmarketing: And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: we can stick with what we've already got. In a lot other ways too.\nproject manager: Okay. So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em, the voice recognition will be better. Okay.\nmarketing: I think it's our lower risk option\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option.\nproject manager: Okay. Sorted.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition.\nuser interface: It's you and me outside a little here. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right?\nproject manager: Yeah, well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: but yeah that's our next step, it'll be a developing of prototype.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things?\nproject manager: Yes. We'll just run through it yeah, yeah, um.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power. Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition? Or this kinesthetic one, would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control?\nindustrial designer: Um, the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that, we should install a small backup battery.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason, the remote hasn't been exposed to \nmarketing: Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement,\nproject manager: Mm. Yep.\nmarketing: like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably \nindustrial designer: It's true. Yeah, it works about the same as a solar powered calculator,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and you know how those those don't really require that much light,\nuser interface: Calculator.\nmarketing: Yeah. True. True.\nindustrial designer: um, but obviously a little more light than a calculator, but we're not talking about a lot of light. Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything.\nproject manager: Right.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: What do you think Ron?\nuser interface: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head. If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that, kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something.\nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Interesting.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Why, why moving away from hand-held, why?\nuser interface: Just a thought.\nindustrial designer: What's the uh idea?\nuser interface: Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point.\nmarketing: I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Do you think people that are people that buy a remote, are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes.\nmarketing: True, and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people, like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too,\nproject manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well.\nmarketing: right.\nproject manager: But that's done, that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it, Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: I mean, why not have a little rounded kind of thing,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: it could still have the basic buttons on it. Um, 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well.\nmarketing: With the bu yeah.\nproject manager: And maybe a menu button and so forth, you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out.\nindustrial designer: I think, I think you're on to something\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote. Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good, even though and hand-held the same time.\nmarketing: True. Way to go.\nuser interface: I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things.\nmarketing: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: you know like that little pod looking thing?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, those are nice.\nuser interface: Exactly.\nproject manager: Yeah, I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: and get back to it\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um \nmarketing: That would be kinda neat. Terracotta bowl or something. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Still, I mean, yeah, along those lines.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah I like that, I like that idea a lot. Um, let's see what we can do as far as that goes. And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel,\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: um you know\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit. You know\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it.\nindustrial designer: Right. Just kind of the squishy feel.\nmarketing: Yeah, which is the next big thing, so that's not gonna hurt us either. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm 'kay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But to be fair, yeah, I mean, you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah I like it, I like the idea, that's good.\nmarketing: Handy.\nproject manager: Um and we've sorted of discussed costs, um. I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing, if we run a bit over-budget, that might be okay, um.\nindustrial designer: Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost, I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a \nindustrial designer: and I'm just having to guess.\nproject manager: we'll have more of an idea later on. Um. And we just yeah go from there. Um, so\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out, um, I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function, you know, not too complex.\nmarketing: Mm. Right. Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis, although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions, they should be secondary, at least if not functionally then visually, like those shouldn't be \nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Like maybe have menu things.\nmarketing: Take precedence,\nindustrial designer: If, if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\nmarketing: yeah.\nindustrial designer: like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things.\nmarketing: And they slide.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options, in p\nuser interface: Think then we're hitting our cost issue again.\nproject manager: Yeah\nmarketing: True,\nproject manager: we've also got the the me the thing of,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: we're still not making it easier then.\nproject manager: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote, how do we yeah.\nmarketing: True.\nproject manager: B But no I mean\nmarketing: Fair enough.\nproject manager: we could do a slide or a compartment, you know, like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing, it'd be easy to have a compartment in there.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Or you know, a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing, like on um like on a D_V_D_ player. You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Yeah it's just a scroll.\nproject manager: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use, are we going to use scroll buttons? Rubber buttons? Um \nproject manager: Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case\nmarketing: Yeah. Probably.\nproject manager: we might as well stick with that um.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command.\nmarketing: Right. Mm. Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it, are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Mm 'kay, um. We've already kind of covered this as well. That seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market, um.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right, particularly in technological fields,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so that's exactly where we're headed.\nproject manager: Okay. Um. Yeah alright, well, more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype.\nuser interface: Well what are we actually doing?\nproject manager: Right.\nuser interface: What were \nproject manager: I was just gonna step on to um {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh. Oh it wasn't in the way but yeah, whatever.\nproject manager: I wasn't? Oh, my bad um sorry.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No, don't worry about it.\nproject manager: The um, yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth\nuser interface: Sure.\nproject manager: any other final thoughts before we go ahead and\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: cool?\nindustrial designer: So\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people?\nproject manager: Um.\nindustrial designer: Or are we just going to go with one?..It's very, it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and that might open up your market a little bit obviously, but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's a tough situation,\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: but obviously having more cases also costs more so \nproject manager: Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do, you could have uh a, you know, a um uh kind of a natural wood colour, like a stained wood and um, I don't know, olive green or something.\nindustrial designer: There's an idea.\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nproject manager: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing.\nuser interface: And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme.\nmarketing: Yeah, get in there. Yeah, totally.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours. But yeah, stick with the same kind of kinda yeah, the same basic non-remote kind of remote design. Cool. Alright, so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour, um. I want the uh I'd like Nathan, I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel, what can we accomplish, um, given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote. Um, what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple. Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place. Um, and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff. Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype, um using um prototype building materials um.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well.\nindustrial designer: Oh excellent yeah.\nproject manager: So that's what to start with for now, is that alright, you guys feel clear about this?\nmarketing: Cool.\nindustrial designer: That sounds good.\nuser interface: Fabulous.\nproject manager: Alright. I guess we'll just hit the bricks. Thanks guys.\nmarketing: Cool.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "The whole meeting was about a detailed prototype of the remote control. As before, this meeting also began with personal presentations. The Industrial Design focused on the components of the remote control, including the energy source, the buttons and the materials, while the User Interface suggested to use voice recognition technique and add secured or hidden programming onto the touch screen. Then the problem came that if they would like to make it so complex, they would go beyond the budget and have to raise the cost. Thus they decided to simplify some functions and buttons. Before the meeting ended, they also discussed the shape of the remote control.", "zh_summary": "此次会议详细讨论了遥控器的产品原型。和以往的会议一样，这次会议也是以个人陈述作为开场。产品设计部的重点在于遥控器的组成部分，包括充电方式、按钮和材料，而用户界面部建议使用语音识别技术，并在触摸屏上添加安全保护或可隐藏的程序。但问题是，如果他们真的采用了如此复杂的设计，他们就会超出预算，提高成本。最后，他们决定简化一些功能和按钮。在会议结束前，他们还讨论了遥控器的形状。", "fr_summary": "Toute la réunion portait sur un prototype détaillé de la télécommande.

{"fname": "product_dev_2", "dialogue": "project manager: All hooked up. Okay, so now we are here at the functional design meeting. Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the sh shared documents folder. I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Did anyone?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: No. Oh well. Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there, there's a shared project documents folder. Um and it should be in there.\nuser interface: Mm. Um um wi on on a what? Oh project project documents, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Project documents, yeah. So I'll put it in there.\nuser interface: Oh okay, yeah.\nproject manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe, to let you know it's there?\nuser interface: Yes, I think so.\nproject manager: Yep. I'll do that next time. Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through, and then I'll send them to you after the meeting. The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, so we'll go through each of you one by one. Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. I just sent\nuser interface: Yeah, the last minute, yeah,\nproject manager: at the last minute, I'm sorry about that,\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um and then we need to, by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group and functions of the remote control. And we've got forty minutes to do that in. So I would say \nindustrial designer: You said uh targ target groups,\nproject manager: yeah?\nindustrial designer: what does that mean?\nproject manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to,\nuser interface: Um \nindustrial designer: Uh okay, 'kay.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: So are \nproject manager: So we need to yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself. So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you. Does anyone have a preference for going first?\nindustrial designer: Alright. I can go first,\nproject manager: You wanna go first?\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. Hmm.\nproject manager: Okay, so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I assume we just pull it out?\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right. Um so f from the \nproject manager: Just before you start, to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back,\nuser interface: Okay, yeah, afterwards, yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Right sure.\nproject manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down.\nindustrial designer: Uh okay. So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design, functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other. So this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role. Um the identification of the components, uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person. Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design, so it's a cyclical process. Okay, so these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email. Uh I just quickly jotted them down. Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other. Um okay, so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated, so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control. Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television, because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television. How however, our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television, in order to keep things simple. Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard. Okay, so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control. Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interf interface communicates with the chip, so I'll basic go over to the Okay. So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell, uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip, which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So whe when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code, which is then communicated to the remote site, which h has an infrared receiver. Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating. Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger, basically.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible. This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time. And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design, so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions. That's about it. So anything that you would like to know or \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Thanks.\nproject manager: Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point?\nindustrial designer: No, I don't have any idea about what each component costs.\nproject manager: Br\nindustrial designer: Um yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. 'Cause that's something to consider, I guess, if we're if we're using more advanced technology, it might increase the price.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Certainly, yeah. So so tha yeah, we definitely need to operate within our constraints,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but um unfortunately I I do not have any data, so uh I just identified the functional components for that.\nproject manager: That's fine. Are there any more questions, or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end?\nuser interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think that will do. Okay, so do you want to \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah, I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue \nproject manager: Yes, shall shall we pull this up?\nuser interface: okay, yeah.\nproject manager: I think that has to come out of there.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm 'kay.\nuser interface: Thanks.\nproject manager: Yeah, I thought those last minute things, they're gonna hit you the worst. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh i Okay, I hope wait. Should it just \nindustrial designer: I it'll take some time.\nproject manager: It ta takes a little Oh, and have you \nuser interface: There's just nothing.\nproject manager: you need to then also press on yours, function F_ eight,\nuser interface: Oh right, right, right, um \nproject manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight.\nuser interface: Okay. Nothin\nindustrial designer: Oh, there it is, yeah.\nuser interface: okay, something is coming up.\nproject manager: Now it's coming,\nindustrial designer: It'll come up, it um uh no signal.\nproject manager: computer no signal.\nuser interface: No signal? Why?\nproject manager: Maybe again?\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, it says something now,\nuser interface: Oh. My my computer went blank now.\nindustrial designer: adjusting \nproject manager: Okay, adjusting.\nuser interface: Adjusting. But I don't see anything\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: There we go, there we go.\nuser interface: I don't see anything on my computer now.\nindustrial designer: Oh, that's strange.\nproject manager: Oh, if you press if you press function and that again\nuser interface: This is the problem, but \nproject manager: there's there's usually three modes, one where it's only here, one where it's only there, and one where it's both.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Um .\nindustrial designer: And one more time.\nproject manager: Okay, so one more time.\nuser interface: Uh now it's okay. No? No.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Should yeah just wait for a moment, adjusting.\nuser interface: Oh okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, that's fine, that's good. Okay, let's start from the beginning. So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up. Um 'kay, so the method I was um adopting at this point, it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls, uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used. And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities. And yeah, and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set, so this quite straightforward. And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. Um um I als\nindustrial designer: Sorry, cou could you go back for a second?\nuser interface: okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh switching on off channel, uh volume, okay, that's great.\nuser interface: 'Kay. Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design, like operating a V_C_R_, but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players, but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them, but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something. Um then yeah, the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel, and then volume has to be there. But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu. And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So at the for the time being that's uh that's all.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: If you have questions \nproject manager: If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management, but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_, I could get back to them and see. It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about.\nuser interface: Yeah, and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever, so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things.\nproject manager: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one?\nindustrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. Um but um so so at this stage, uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that?\nuser interface: Um well, I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: I mean um what other options would you have? A little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and it'll make the costs yeah.\nuser interface: and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly, not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons, but if if you have other mm proposals um.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh i if the if the costs allow, we can have like an L_C_D_ display\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well. So yeah? Cool.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Yep.\nproject manager: Sure, we can discuss that maybe after the next one.\nmarketing: Cool. Do you wanna give me the little cable thing?\nproject manager: Do you want to yeah.\nuser interface: Uh am I going in the right direction?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: No. Wait.\nproject manager: Oh, I'm getting hungry. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, here it comes. Okay, here you are.\nmarketing: Cool. Ah, that's why it won't meet. Okay, cool.\nproject manager: You set?\nmarketing: Yep, cool. Okay, functional requirements.\nproject manager: Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here.\nmarketing: Alright, yeah.\nproject manager: Hello.\nindustrial designer: try to press \nproject manager: Is it plugged in prop\nindustrial designer: oh, okay,\nmarketing: It's working.\nproject manager: it's working?\nindustrial designer: yep.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Cool, okay.\nproject manager: Excellent.\nmarketing: So what I have, wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire. Um so it was all about, you know, how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control, you know. What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control. Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens, so I should have taken that bit out, but anyway.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um okay, so. What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are, so you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different. Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense. Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know, a nice looking remote control.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um current remote controls, they don't match the user behaviour well, as you'll see on the next slide. Um I dunno what zapping is, but \nproject manager: It's um switching between channels, sort of randomly going through.\nmarketing: Oh, right. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. Um okay, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: so that's going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: they just make it look ugly.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Okay? Cool. Um so this is my little graph thing.\nproject manager: Ooh, that's a bit difficult to see.\nmarketing: Mm k\nproject manager: If you explain it to us it'll be fine.\nmarketing: Okay, well, I can send it to all of you. What it is is um it's cones,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting. Um but \nproject manager: I liked the, I liked the litt\nmarketing: ooh where's it go?\nproject manager: ooh come back.\nmarketing: Back. Oh.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Oh yes, cool. Okay, I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um okay, so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: What you can't see is volume selection, it's a little bit higher than all the others.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm, that's the next one along, yeah? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, so what the graph shows is that, you know, power, channel selection and volume selection are important, and the rest of them, you know, nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance, you know,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so on a scale of one to ten, how important is that\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and, you know, channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential, and the power, well it's not quite so essential, apparently, although I don't understand how it couldn't be,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: um and everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control, 'cause they're just not needed, and they're not used. Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing. Okay, cool. So um okay, so this is what people find annoying about remote controls. Uh that they get lost, that the uh you know, they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know, watching T_V_, then that's the least of your problems,\nproject manager: The remote control. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but you know, it's up there.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Um that yeah. Okay, so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that, like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages \nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know, not straining your wrists watching T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Yes. Okay, cool. Right, um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table, and I didn't have time to white it out again.\nproject manager: That's alright.\nmarketing: Um okay, but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software. So you can see from that that, you know, younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software, whereas as people get older, they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it. Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about, but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_, you know, tends to be people talking and um, you know, how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Um okay? Cool. Um okay, so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool. Um you know, functional, so it's useful, but minimalist. Um there's a there's an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you're filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, and you've got all this stuff, and you're just like, what the hell is that, who is ever gonna use it? You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, so I think we need to aim for both.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Mm.\nmarketing: Um okay, then a long battery life, like you were talking about earlier and um, you know, I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there, and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um and then like a locator, so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: not a mobile phone \nindustrial designer: Some kind of a ring,\nproject manager: Keys and things like that,\nindustrial designer: some \nmarketing: Yeah, that's it, you know.\nproject manager: yeah. Whistle and it screams at you, yeah.\nmarketing: I know, it's weird. My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps, something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_, you know,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: So okay? Cool. That's me. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay, that's great,\nproject manager: That's you, excellent.\nuser interface: Um that's very good,\nindustrial designer: thanks.\nproject manager: Um.\nuser interface: very interesting.\nproject manager: I'm just gonna tick yes.

{"fname": "product_dev_72", "dialogue": "industrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Are you sure I got it all head's kinda small.\nuser interface: How're we placed in terms of the \nmarketing: Okay. \nuser interface: alright.\nmarketing: We're okay?\nindustrial designer: Guess I should probably try to sit up straight.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Like that? Okay, cool.\nmarketing: We're good?\nindustrial designer: Oh, I think mine's fallen off.\nuser interface: It fell That's why.\nmarketing: I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh okay.\nuser interface: Ah.\nproject manager: Okay? Right, so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick. Yeah, PowerPoint.\nindustrial designer: Wow.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Very official.\nproject manager: Yeah, well, you know,.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it. Right. Um. So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction, this is uh so it right. Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting. Um We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training. Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet, the whiteboard. Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up. Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that, I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask, don't tell. Um so um if you say something about marketing, right, sorted, um y is\nmarketing: You're just gonna believe me,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we'll go from there.\nproject manager: Exactly. Um I mean\nmarketing: Fair enough.\nproject manager: obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it. I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like\nmarketing: Prove it\nproject manager: yeah yeah exactly\nmarketing: yeah, okay.\nproject manager: so, 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um. And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun, you know maybe you went to um uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that, why not, you know\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it. So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical?\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, that's fine.\nuser interface: Sure.\nmarketing: Works for me.\nproject manager: Sweet. Cool. So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website. Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible, that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something. So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way. Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics. And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I can't remember,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um the Industrial Designer\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: hey right on alright,\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: getting into it um\nmarketing: There you go.\nproject manager: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time. And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good, you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um, yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand, or something like that. Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up. So that's the detailed design. So it's a three stage kind of thing. Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it, I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could, not all five, if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um. Oh, we skipped introductions. Nice. I'm a excellent Project Manager. Um.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I'm Marty,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology. Um yeah. So \nmarketing: I'm Sarah, I went to Michigan, and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something. Marketing,\nproject manager: Expert {vocalsound}\nmarketing: yeah Expert. Expert.\nproject manager: Don't play yourself down. Expert {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Fine. That's me.\nuser interface: I'm Ron. I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer.\nindustrial designer: I'm Nathan, I'm from California, and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology.\nproject manager: Where did you go to uni Nathan?\nindustrial designer: U_C_L_A_.\nproject manager: Oh brilliant. Cool. My little brother goes there.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: Right so desert island discs.\nmarketing: So.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us?\nproject manager: Well I'll t i\nmarketing: I'm waiting to know.\nproject manager: no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down. See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are, I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent\nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: but there's some other options, if you're a T_V_ slut\nmarketing: Fair enough.\nproject manager: like I am like Smallville terrible television show\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but I happen to love it,\nmarketing: Oh, Smallville.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it's rubbish but I love it.\nmarketing: I went to high school with Tom Willing actually.\nproject manager: T the the main c the main character?\nmarketing: The guy. Yeah.\nproject manager: Wow. Is he a wanker?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. Very much so. Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless.\nproject manager: He looks really tall, like he's gotta be like six six.\nmarketing: Yeah. He is a big guy. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. Um okay so I really like Jeff Buckley. You guys heard of Jeff Buckley?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have. Um and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's a r\nmarketing: Good call.\nproject manager: Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think. It's kinda weird. Anyway\nmarketing: Interesting.\nproject manager: yeah. Yeah, you're like press and it's.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Kinda cool.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You'll see. Alright so um\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: whoever wants to get up next, you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want.\nmarketing: I guess I'll go next then.\nproject manager: Right on.\nuser interface: Go for it.\nmarketing: Okay. Don't wanna lose all my mikes, plugged in here. Okay. This is basically just pen practice huh?\nproject manager: W\nmarketing: Okay. Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here. Um. Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of, Chris Bathgate,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: local Michigan folk singer,\nproject manager: Nice.\nindustrial designer: Wow.\nmarketing: really lame\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and uh uh what else did I bring with me? Probably classical, to totally geek it out,\nproject manager: Okay yeah yeah.\nmarketing: yeah I think. And my family guy D_V_D_s\nproject manager: Well yeah.\nmarketing: but we don't need to write that one down.\nproject manager: Oh, family guy. Isn't h has h\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: do you watch the new season?\nmarketing: No. Are you getting it online,\nproject manager: I think I'm gonna start downloading it\nmarketing: or is it on sky?\nproject manager: yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, that'd be nice.\nuser interface: Alright. Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_. Anybody?\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: No? no?\nmarketing: 'Fraid not.\nuser interface: Afro beat orchestra, very cool.\nproject manager: Afro beat orchestra? Very cool. Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Sounds nice.\nuser interface: Fift S\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: they like fifteen members from Brooklyn. Um and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium, in Brussels in April first.\nproject manager: Wow.\nmarketing: Exciting.\nuser interface: Yeah. It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways.\nmarketing: That'd be .\nuser interface: Um thing I love about Edinburgh \nmarketing: Oh. I didn't even read those. Oops. I shouldn't admit that. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for. It's they're designed specifically to ignore. I it's th brilliant.\nindustrial designer: Oh, wow. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's the five by five, I can't read that much.\nproject manager: Ah yes yes yes okay I see that.\nmarketing: Yeah\nproject manager: Vomit. Yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: oh it's so horrible.\nproject manager: Street pizza.\nuser interface: Love um \nproject manager: It's so brilliant. I've seen more urine in this city than ever before,\nmarketing: Oh my God.\nuser interface: I just came from Glasgow\nproject manager: I mean \nmarketing: Seriously?\nuser interface: and I'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately.\nindustrial designer: There's more vomit there.\nuser interface: Um.\nproject manager: It's so minging.\nuser interface: I w\nmarketing: It really is {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh.\nuser interface: Does uh yeah.\nindustrial designer: Alright. Yep.\nuser interface: Ready? Minging? Nice.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I'm going local. Going local.\nmarketing: Slide it in there. Yeah.\nproject manager: I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right.\nmarketing: Yeah fair enough. I've already got more than I can keep track of. And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people,\nproject manager: Oh, have you been home yet?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: They'll be like, say something British,\nmarketing: no.\nproject manager: and you're like oh shut up family. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I know. I know.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Um \nmarketing: Oh it should be interesting.\nindustrial designer: Let's see.\nmarketing: Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back.\nproject manager: Right\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: They're gonna love that one.\nproject manager: you s you're gonna stay here?\nmarketing: Probably.\nproject manager: Wow.\nmarketing: Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide.\nuser interface: Nice.\nproject manager: Bad religion?\nmarketing: 'Cause \nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's the music I grew up listening to.\nmarketing: nice.\nproject manager: Yeah yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Of course.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And so there \nmarketing: Oh, now I can think of so many other ones.\nproject manager: Well yeah that's why \nmarketing: That's how it works.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Something I miss about my hometown.\nproject manager: I miss coffee.\nindustrial designer: Burritos\nmarketing: Mm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Burritos.\nuser interface: Nice.\nindustrial designer: that cost less than eight Pounds. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh \nproject manager: Oh yeah two two bucks.\nmarketing: Any thing that are like free.\nproject manager: Where are you from in California by the way?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I grew up in San Diego,\nproject manager: Did you really? What part?\nindustrial designer: but yeah um La Jolla, P_B_ .\nproject manager: Yeah I'm from San Diego as well. Yeah oh man.\nmarketing: Nice. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But really uh I last lived in San Francisco, I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen.\nproject manager: Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego.\nindustrial designer: It's different. 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them.\nmarketing: It must make all the difference. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it really does.\nproject manager: Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it\nmarketing: Ah.\nproject manager: like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay, it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: like literally two bucks for this massive I miss\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: yeah good call on that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Where you from in San Diego?\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego, I live like five minutes from the zoo. So\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: North Park actually if you want to get real specific.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, my grandparents lived on um thirty second.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is,\nproject manager: Yes. On university,\nindustrial designer: and\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Cafe Forte \nproject manager: Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house.\nindustrial designer: Cool.\nproject manager: Yeah, pretty cool. Small world as we were discussing before.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Especially when we're all from the same general region. Right so okay, success on the whiteboard. You can harness the awesome power\nmarketing: There you go.\nproject manager: a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s\nindustrial designer: Wow.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and things we like about the city you know, I think we'll \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um right so {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros. Um. This is what the finance department has told me, the C_F_O_ but I don't know, I'm not sold on this, it's pretty dear, I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote. It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me. Um so\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it, the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it. Eur internationally. So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably. Um so\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s\nmarketing: Makes sense.\nproject manager: but um you know\nmarketing: Uh.\nproject manager: I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing. Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty. So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can. Um s right so um just to close up, I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager, sorted. Um. Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it. Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do. Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want.\nmarketing: What they're looking for.\nproject manager: So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have, you know like uh so \nmarketing: And negotiate that. Uh.\nproject manager: yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email. But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth. Um any questions, before we get started?\nuser interface: I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control, we can't kind of build it into other uh products.\nproject manager: You mean to like \nuser interface: For instance like a mobile phone or something like that.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Sounds interesting.\nproject manager: Hmm. Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't think there's any rules about it yet. So \nindustrial designer: Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less?\nproject manager: Well, have a think about it.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: I mean\nuser interface: Yep. Okay.\nproject manager: I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able\nmarketing: W yeah.\nproject manager: isn't it. I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: The clapper. No I mean {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: no, good idea, good idea. We'll see what see what \nindustrial designer: Maybe a remote with changeable faces, like the faces that you can buy for phones.\nuser interface: Nice. Hot. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I like the little cover thingies.\nproject manager: Uh-huh y I like that {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. That's true, I guess we we probably have some time, maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do, go back to um I don't really have any. Let me bring up something about our basic goals here, what we want to accomplish. Uh project announcement. Ts ts ts Yeah. Not so much.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: All right we'll find them, we're on our own.\nuser interface: Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here?\nproject manager: Yeah yeah let's do it, let's do.\nuser interface: S does anybody have any initial ideas?\nproject manager: I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause \nmarketing: Good idea. Start your minutes. Um \nproject manager: Yeah I mean oh yeah right. So initial ideas. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: right, we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things, as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do, like your microwave or your front door\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: or like to have everything on one thing,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but then, I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: S smaller's better.\nmarketing: you can't tell what they do.\nindustrial designer: Simple.\nuser interface: But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design\nmarketing: Yeah. Specific.\nuser interface: so touch screen design rather than button\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Oh right. That'd be different.\nuser interface: so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things.\nmarketing: Interesting.\nproject manager: Yeah that's slick\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: isn't it. I mean like stylist yeah like a just a\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: True.\nproject manager: yeah. Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this, perfect. Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality.\nmarketing: Mm. Mm.\nproject manager: Um and we also \nmarketing: Right. We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Too confusing.\nindustrial designer: It's gonna be too complicated, too crowded with buttons and things.\nproject manager: I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: of um so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Possibly.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: I don't think one exists.\nmarketing: An interesting option.\nproject manager: Be a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes.\nmarketing: Yeah. Definitely.\nproject manager: Yeah all the other universal remotes. Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there, I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL, N_T_S_C_, region one \nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: I'm pretty sure there is.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: that he just points at his telev any television he wants\nmarketing: That \nuser interface: and it'll figure out the the specifications of it\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: and will control it\nproject manager: Interesting. Okay.\nuser interface: um so\nmarketing: Awesome.\nuser interface: I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world.\nproject manager: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um all right. So. I li I'm liking that idea, this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features. Um.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Um. Let's see.\nindustrial designer: I think, making it out of a nice material would be very important, because so many of those remotes that you see, these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah. Keeping it nice and slick, would be important. And I don't know, like, there's such a problem with losing them,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: so we're gonna have to be careful with what like \nuser interface: Oh.\nmarketing: Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool.\nproject manager: Uh let's see. Um.\nuser interface: I like the idea of the uh multi plate.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah yeah okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: In in\nmarketing: Fi b like what are they called, those face plate things?\nproject manager: Think they're just called face plates?\nmarketing: Isn't there a name for them?\nproject manager: I don't know.\nindustrial designer: something,\nmarketing: Are they? I dunno.\nindustrial designer: uh we'll have to come up with a name,\nuser interface: I like.\nindustrial designer: patent it.\nuser interface: We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well.\nmarketing: Yeah. Something really cool.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Leopard print or something. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: For those cold winter days. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Leopard print. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: I think, it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device, maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote.\nmarketing: True.\nproject manager: Mm. But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Um {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it.\nindustrial designer: True.\nuser interface: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either \nmarketing: True.\nuser interface: well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page. Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones, you have a page button and it goes,\nuser interface: Th\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: could we do something like that?\nindustrial designer: I think so.\nuser interface: That's cool.\nmarketing: Probably.\nuser interface: I think we could design into that. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Good.\nproject manager: Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nproject manager: you know \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years, very much so.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Curves.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno, selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote, twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price. Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: that's black and you know m massive,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere.\nmarketing: Mm. Definitely.\nproject manager: But um have a think about what we can do, have a think about what we want to do, how we're gonna sell it\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: and um \nmarketing: Or if you our users in mind, like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design, no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: and who we're gonna be able to get it out of. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: 'S true.\nmarketing: But \nuser interface: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros?\nproject manager: Twenty five Euros.\nmarketing: Euros.\nuser interface: Slight difference I guess.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar. Although, computer parts, all \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: if you're gonna upgrade your computer, buy it in the States. Like um do you guys know Fry's? Huge computer uh electronics store?\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: Mm-mm.\nproject manager: They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about. Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now, I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents, so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas, you can consult them at your leisure.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: And uh right so thanks for that. Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into.\nmarketing: With half an hour?\nproject manager: Um. Yes.\nmarketing: 'Kay. Perfect.\nproject manager: Thanks guys.\nmarketing: Cool.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nuser interface: Thank you.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "The meeting was about a preliminary idea of new remote control, covering the price, the functions, the appearance and the name.

{"fname": "product_dev_82", "dialogue": "user interface: Yes, well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept. Uh, first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose, uh show you some samples, uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe, already. And uh my personal preferences. Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off. The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off. The channels buttons, one to nine, and uh off uh uh zero to nine, and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine. Uh the volume and channel quadrants, uh left and right, up and down arrows, to uh do the volume and channel. And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display. Um, I found some uh interesting uh uh samples. Examples.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh \nmarketing: Large.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long.\nmarketing: A lot a lot of buttons buttons.\nuser interface: Um, power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right. Um, well we see the the the same uh arrows. Like there. And uh Yeah, well arrow b buttons can be blue. And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons. Some buttons have icons like the play and stop, but we don't use that. But uh, these we we have to choose the right icons, or or letters. Uh this is the V_ for volume, but they're both uh a V_.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um Yeah. So, that's \nproject manager: Can you go back one page? For the uh menu, what do we use for that? We don't have buttons for the menu.\nuser interface: Uh, well \nproject manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .\nuser interface: Yeah. I thought that was our uh idea.\nproject manager: Okay. But uh \nuser interface: So, uh how \nproject manager: You have to put it on the \nuser interface: Like this.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Or or this. And that the menu button is okay.\nproject manager: Yeah but, has to be clear that you can use the arrows.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: Uh, so the The icons on the arrows, as well, you mean.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Yes. The second one.\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh, well that's something to uh think about. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh, maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation. And you will see it.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already, or in the next uh meeting.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But uh, as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo, I would uh recommend a yellow case. Uh, round edges. The logo at the bottom. And uh, well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour. So, it's good. Uh, recognisable. K so, I think.\nproject manager: Not too much colours.\nuser interface: Uh, no. Not too much.\nproject manager: No, it's not flower power.\nuser interface: But uh No, no, no.

So welcome back.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What do  do we have to do? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: .\nproject manager: So first. I want to say I'm the secretary, so I make the minutes. You find them in your in the map in the From the group. There's the minutes from the first meeting. You'll find the next minutes also there. Then I wanna hear from you, what you've done. And after that I have some new product requirements. So And after that we have to make decisions, what we will do. And then we're ready. We have forty minutes for this meeting. After that we'll have lunch. So first I wanna ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did. So \nindustrial designer: That's my task. Okay. Uh I've Where have I put it? My Documents or not? Hmm. I've save it on my computer, my presentation.\nproject manager: Yeah on your computer, or the \nindustrial designer: But where?\nproject manager: What's the name?\nindustrial designer: Uh uh uh \nproject manager: What's the name of it?\nindustrial designer: It was about the working of the remote control.\nproject manager: It's the technical function or the functional requirements.\nindustrial designer: Nope.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Not a of Wait. The working design. But I've saved it.\nproject manager: Working design.\nindustrial designer: But now I don't know where it is. Hmm.\nproject manager: Working design. What is this? Product documents.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. And I import this until \nproject manager: On the desktop. Up. up. Up. Up.\nindustrial designer: One more.\nproject manager: Up.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. My Documents. Nope.\nindustrial designer: What the fuck is this?\nproject manager: Gone. Well you Um Nah. Nah, nah, nah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: PowerPoint. Working design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah that's the empty one.\nproject manager: And \nindustrial designer: I had one.\nproject manager: Presentation of working design.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh. Open it. Okay here it is.\nproject manager: Save as .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh it's \nmarketing: Desktop.\nproject manager: Project .\nindustrial designer: Project.\nmarketing: Yeah. Okay. Well.\nproject manager: Save.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Very good.\nindustrial designer: A little later but here it is.\nmarketing: \nproject manager: Okay. So {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So okay. It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you. It's about the working of the remote control. I just had an half an hour j to study it\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and I don't get it.\nmarketing: Make it.\nproject manager: Now have ten minutes to tell it.\nindustrial designer: Ten minutes to tell it. Okay. I think it will be a few minutes and \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: First uh I will tell you something about the findings, what I discovered about the remote control. The working bout it uh of it. Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map, and it's the top of the remote control. With a little bit of science, uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes. And then uh what I'll think about it. First, the findings. The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside. Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: um because its uh not so expensive. And there are uh a lot of uh wires, uh which um connect the components in it, the battery, and there are um switches and things like that. There's a lot of small uh electronics. So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it. Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it. Now  And here I have the top of the remote control. Uh here's some kind of chip. Uh on top of this, there are uh the numbers. Uh you have all on your remote control. And uh the teletext uh button. And uh here's the battery. And when you push the button, it will uh will be sent to the chip. And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components. That's what I said, it's very difficult.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And after that it will be sent to the infrared. And that will send it to your television. That's a short h uh how it works. Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult, but we all we all don't get it. My preferences? It's uh it won't be uh We shouldn't make it too big. Uh also for the cost, uh we should only put one battery on it. A long-lasting battery. Uh also for the cost, uh use only plastic. Not other materials. Also because of the cost, uh not too much buttons on it. We can also make uh a button uh with a  menu uh button. And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_. And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: That's I think it's easier. And the bleep signal, y uh you told us. Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something, when the battery's empty, then there is a bleep. Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something. And also the bleep, when what I told you about uh when you lost it, and you push a button, and then you hear bleep bleep, and we will find it. This is uh just uh \nproject manager: Oh oh. Two questions.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: The battery. You say one battery is cheaper. Why?\nindustrial designer: If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light, then it will be cheaper than when we use two.\nproject manager: Yeah but when you use two, you can use it two times longer.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting.\nproject manager: Okay so it's the size of the remote control.\nindustrial designer: Just Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay and the buttons. When you use it on the television, you've you need the television, wh which can use it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company?\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions?\nproject manager: I think we have to use it also on other televisions though.\nindustrial designer: Then this is an option. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions. And then we make it easier uh for our televisions. And on the other tele televisions, you can also use it, but then we won't use the\nproject manager: Yeah but I don't I think it They are two different things though. We have to choose one. It has to work on o uh all televisions.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah? Okay. Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions. And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And I just uh have one more idea. Uh maybe it's one of your tasks. But Uh, to have a trendy remote control, we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones. To change covers. So if you have uh a trendy half with all red, uh yellow and something. And then you can put a red cover on it.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: And also different things.\nproject manager: Yeah. Good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: Will this will this add to the cost?\nindustrial designer: Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one. And then you can buy the covers.\nmarketing: Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it. D does it make it more difficult to design?\nindustrial designer: I think it will be a little more difficult, but not too much.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Not much. 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones.\nproject manager: Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones.\nindustrial designer: Just one.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it, and see if it works. If it won't works then we'll get something else. Then we uh won't g uh go further with it.\nproject manager: Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost?\nindustrial designer: Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China, it it won't be I guess so expensive I think.\nproject manager: Yeah but there are also design cost. I don't think When you have a remote control, do you change the cover? Would you change the cover?\nindustrial designer: Maybe. I wi I won't.\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it, and uh the the children think, oh this is my remote control, uh I made a picture on it. Uh \nproject manager: N yeah but I think that too less people would change it for good profit. So \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Okay. And the other people? What do you think about it? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um \nuser interface: Yeah it's a good idea. But If if it Yeah, I don't I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: You're the Project Manager. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yes. That's it.\nproject manager: That's clear. Okay thank you. So now the User Interface Designer.\nuser interface: Oh. That's me. Uh Come on. . Ah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set. Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way. No cords attached. And uh well, it all by pushing a button on the remote. That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting. Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web. Uh well the same idea here. Uh message to the television. And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off, and uh switching channels, and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that. Uh well these are two uh remotes, and that's our uh our dilemma I think. Uh We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is. But uh shall we make a basic remote control, uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more. Or uh uh more functions on the remote. Uh maybe more devices you can influence. Uh a radio or a v a video recorder, uh V_C_R_. Yeah well that's our dilemma. Um any ideas about that? Basic or multifunctional?\nproject manager: We'll got back on that later.\nuser interface: Okay yeah. Yeah well the that was just on my mind.\nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go. Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay.\nproject manager: 'Kay, thank you. Then it's your turn, the marketing expert.\nmarketing: Okay. Uh um m Yeah. Um yeah okay. This bit too far. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market, about um yeah what people think. Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons. And we looked at uh several um things. Uh among them design, uh d d how d did they like the use of it, uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls. Uh well what what will be our market. And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features. If um that would be a good idea or not. Well our findings. Uh our users, they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls. Um uh they especially found found them very ugly. And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it. Uh well they also zap a lot. So uh zapping uh should be very easy. And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons. So a lot of unused buttons. There is more findings. Uh on the buttons. Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not? And how much would they use them? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection. And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are. The power, volume and channel selections are very relevant. Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important. Uh not important they found the audio, uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch, or the left or right. Uh the screen and the brightness. And uh channel settings. Uh th and they also are not used very often. Then we have a few um graphs about the market. Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups. Um as you can see, most users are uh between thirty six and forty five. Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big. And to come back on the the swapping uh things, uh I don't think uh, I I think the younger will be most interest in it. But uh they are not a very big group. Um in the we asked them, uh how would you like a s a new feature. If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control, what would you think of it. Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice. And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And they won't like it. And another thing, how would you like to have a speech recognition on it. Well here we see the same. Young users uh think that's an interesting idea. And old users not. Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim. Uh the first are the younger, the age between sixteen and forty five. Uh they are highly interested in the features, as you can see uh here. And um they are more critical on their money spending. Uh the second group is the older group. Aged between forty six and sixty five. They are less interested in uh new features. But uh they spend their money more easily. Now if we look back at this graph, we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent. And the second group about forty percent. So the the first group is bigger. Well then I come to my uh personal preferences. Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at. Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it. But less of them will buy it. Um well I uh Okay. What I thought, um even young people say it's hard to use, remote control. So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use, that's especially aimed at this group, even uh the young group will also be more interested. And um we can make special features. But uh I think it looks nice in the first time. But when use it, uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um well th uh that's my second point.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control. It's about discussion we had earlier. Um You can find most functions on a T_V_ set. So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options, or screen options to change the brightness. And such things. Um well the design is very important. One thing I did not say I think, is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one. But they found most remote controls very ugly. So the design of our remote control is very important. And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly, as most users use it for that. That were my findings.\nproject manager: Okay thank you.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I have uh one question.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: If we aim for the younger people, um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising, uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think we don't have that in our budget.\nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Do you think?\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something.\nindustrial designer: Like No. No.\nuser interface: So it's Yeah, it's hard to uh get the younger group.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nproject manager: I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition. So I think that can be an d good option. L_C_D_.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Just the L_C_D_?\nproject manager: Yes. Only the L_C_D_.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So But we'll come back on that.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Now Oh, go on. What d d d um Um Uh we go  back on the decisions later. Now we have a few new product requirements. First, teletext. We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore. So not necessary.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Next. Only for the television. So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something. Only the television. We look at the age group of forty plus. Uh no, younger than forty. Is a g big group, and like you showed, n not very much people buy our stuff. Fourth point. Our corporate colour and slogan must be used. Very important for the design. So you can see it on our site.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Next. Um no. We have to make our decisions, what we want to do. So like you said, we need the . Maybe it's good to put it in a document. Now we have to decide what controls do we need. So maybe you can tell us.\nmarketing: Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said.\nproject manager: Sorry?\nmarketing: The the requirements you just said,\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: maybe we should first have a discussion about that.\nproject manager: Yes, it's okay.\nmarketing: I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option. Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news.\nproject manager: Yeah but we don't use it. It's a new requirement.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, it's not my requirement.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay, we'll just have to do that.\nproject manager: We have to do this.\nindustrial designer: Okay. No discussion about it.\nmarketing: Okay. Okay sorry.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Then uh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. Unfortunately.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So what controls do we need? Who first?\nuser interface: Well a power button?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Uh power.\nuser interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels. So \nproject manager: Uh mm channel.\nuser interface: But then both the the separate channels. So so uh zero to nine or something.\nproject manager: Channel Zero to nine.\nuser interface: Uh volume.\nproject manager: Volume. Maybe it's easy to pick. What was w your one? Techno\nmarketing: Mine? It's the functional requirements.\nproject manager: Okay. We had w uh no no no no. Where was that example of the \nuser interface: Oh mine.\nproject manager: Johan. That was the the the the the \nuser interface: Technical.\nproject manager: technical Hallo. Okay. What do we need? On-off. Zero to nine.\nindustrial designer: To change to the next channel, just one button. To move up, move down.\nproject manager: Yeah that's the channel.\nmarketing: D Yeah. Do we make a menu?\nproject manager: Menu? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus. Uh \nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager:  M Menu. I think um the only one or two numbers.\nuser interface: Mm yes.\nproject manager: And Hello? That's ch {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think it will be um q quite easy to use, to have uh uh four arrows. Up-down for channel selection,\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: and left-right uh for volume. And uh a menu uh button. And if you press the menu button you get into the menu, and you can use the same buttons. But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options.\nproject manager: On the L_C_D_ screen, you mean?\nmarketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_. Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control.\nproject manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control, 'cause it it has to work on all televisions. So\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: we need \nindustrial designer: But then we come to the costs.\nproject manager: N Yes. But if we have this \nmarketing: 'Kay. But well if you aim at the younger market, um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab, uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control. And also to find the easy to use uh part very important. So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen, and uh not too many buttons, I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost, it will still sell.\nproject manager: So now we don't have a lot of buttons. Is this enough?\nuser interface: Mute.\nproject manager: Mute. Maybe in the menu?\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do.\nproject manager: Mute. Mm-hmm. Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Maybe more? No. Well. Then that's all. This will be the buttons. And I think that's enough for the next phase. So we can go on to \nindustrial designer: But now we have only the buttons.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like? Or \nproject manager: No that's for the next phase.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Um  Phase two is the conceptual design. So then we'll have the concepts.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: That's for the So uh next point. Now we have lunch-break. After that we have t thirty minutes for work. And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons. No. Your individual action, you can find them in the email.

You you got a wind dynamo, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah uh-hum yeah.\nproject manager: it's not that's not streamlined and sexy, having a having a wind up.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal,\nproject manager: I think tha\nindustrial designer: but uh it's \nmarketing: It's about the practicality of it really, isn't it? You know?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. As against a watch, which constantly keeps moving,\nmarketing: I mean if \nindustrial designer: this this thing will have to be tapped every time, which which might be very frustrating for the user.\nproject manager: Depends how much how much movement it really needs.\nindustrial designer: Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that,\nproject manager: Pr presumably if they're suggesting it, then we could use it.\nindustrial designer: yeah, right. Okay, let's keep it option uh keep an option,\nproject manager: I'd I'd keep it on.\nindustrial designer: yeah. Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out, right? It has to be at least curved from one side, yeah.\nproject manager: We don't want that\nuser interface: Yeah\nproject manager: it's no it's not not vegetable.\nuser interface: it's yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um okay, we still have all all the options. Wood, do you think wood will be a good idea?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: you can't make it like thin and \nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: I can't imagine a m wooden remote control.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: The wood thing. Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in, so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky\nindustrial designer: Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break,\nuser interface: wi mm-mm yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: it's it's much more uh \nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences, I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: U yeah wood is not really yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Well it's not very cleanable either,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's true.\nmarketing: do you know.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table, but for a remote control, you know.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: And splinters and stuff and \nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: okay wood is out.\nmarketing: It just m doesn't make any sense, I think is the thing with wood.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, in the case of remote control not really.\nindustrial designer: Okay, now for the really interesting stuff, the interface.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right, so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but uh it seems to be out of trend, you know, nobody seems to be \nmarketing: You have to have some push-buttons, don't you?\nuser interface: Yeah, but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them, wouldn't you?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm right.\nmarketing: G yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so for channel numbers but \nindustrial designer: Oh, if if we have L_C_D_ displays, that opens up a whole world, you know, if you have an L_C_D_ display, then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display.\nuser interface: But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah, it's faster\nproject manager: Just for fast \nuser interface: with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: but if you do want to use L_C_D_, then you flip it open,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but it's it it's more time-consuming.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven.\nindustrial designer: Mm right.\nproject manager: And it \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah L_ L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options. Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine? Or do we have just uh channel plus, channel minus, just to just to scroll?\nuser interface: No, no, I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers,\nindustrial designer: The numbers.\nuser interface: because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels. Um \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_?\nindustrial designer: Or on the L_C_D_ we can, you know \nmarketing: G yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah, I would say buttons,\nmarketing: I would think buttons, yeah.\nproject manager: Buttons.\nuser interface: because it's yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: It's it's the \nindustrial designer: So mm \nmarketing: I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use than any other remote,\nuser interface: I\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible,\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: but, you know, I mean most of the time \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_, I think is the the the issue there.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um \nproject manager: I think that's what you guys are gonna do next,\nindustrial designer: Uh okay.\nproject manager: so if we put down the key um things that we want.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay, so the components.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right, so uh what about the the scrolling uh?\nuser interface: Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah, about the spinning wheel. So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing,\nmarketing: E either or \nuser interface: it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you\nmarketing: G yeah.\nproject manager: Just spinning and not scrolling, I would say.\nuser interface: yeah, yeah,\nmarketing: I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel,\nuser interface: in that case.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: so you have to decide whether you you know, you want to be going so fast or not. But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber, on the basis that it's spongy, then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm um \nproject manager: But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing, effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side, but you folded it in half.\nuser interface: Ah, but I mean you can {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side.\nproject manager: Th that would be on one side, uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber. Uh i it \nproject manager: No, I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside.\nuser interface: Yeah, I um I think so too, I mean the case would be \nmarketing: You want an outside of rubber\nuser interface: yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons,\nmarketing: and then open it up and \nindustrial designer: Or or at the corners, edges, just the edges covered by rubber or something like that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: rubber buttons, but then \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Or maybe like interchangeable cases.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel, but I have like a you know, obviously my iPod's not made of rubber, but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it\nindustrial designer: Right, right.\nmarketing: and I can change the colour, theoretically, to match my outfit.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: okay, so so that gives us a more trendy look as well. Um \nmarketing: Yeah, I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now.\nindustrial designer: Right. Yeah, and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: That's right,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: that's what they're after.\nindustrial designer: So I'll rub that out. And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such, you know, just keep it black, or \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company, so would it be like yellow, grey and black or something, or \nmarketing: That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though.\nproject manager: I guess.\nuser interface: Yeah, does \nproject manager: Bananas. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Banana's yellow, yeah, definitely.\nmarketing: Yeah, but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours, do you know? So you could have like \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple\nproject manager: Green. Yeah.\nmarketing: and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um okay, if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits. Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to \nproject manager: We need the advanced yeah.\nindustrial designer: um what we do need to consider, however, is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering, but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So I'll rub off the other two.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or \nproject manager: That was the \nindustrial designer: Oh is oh the constraint was uh \nmarketing: If \nproject manager: We can't have solar panels with rubber, so.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: solar panels with the rubber.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. So \nmarketing: Yeah, okay, so we lose that I think.\nproject manager: Shall we go for if we're going for rubber, we think uh on as our case, and then \nuser interface: Mm-hmm. And the buttons as well, I think. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We've got five more minutes.\nindustrial designer: we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one, I mean, a although it does seem uh interesting.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: It's just a gimmick.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Uh okay, so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback, right? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that, so \nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in,\nindustrial designer: Ye yeah, we we don't have too much information about it, um \nproject manager: but if it's Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company, yeah.\nproject manager: It's from the company, so \nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay, so so th this is in as well then, the sample speaker.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Okay. And the case is curved on one side, but then flat flat, so it's flipped into each other.\nindustrial designer: Flat on the top. Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer?\nmarketing: Yeah, sure j\nproject manager: Just so we can \nmarketing: Sorry, do you want me to \nproject manager: Nothing, it's right, I'm just There we go.\nmarketing: What does um I_C_S_ mean?\nindustrial designer: I_C_s? Uh integrated circuits.\nmarketing: Okay, cool. So it's advanced integrated circuits?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh oh now I've gone too far.\nindustrial designer: Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s, mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. We're on our way. Okay. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery, the advanced chip\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself, um made out of rubber\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: and the buttons are also rubber. We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel, and we're incorporating voice recognition. That's our overall concept,\nuser interface: Um \nproject manager: and it's gonna look sort of vegetable,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and be in bright vegetable colours.\nuser interface: Uh-huh. So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_, or would it be on the outer \nmarketing: Imagine it would be inside.\nproject manager: I think it's on the \nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: So um actually that could like really cut down your thing,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: so you've got your outside, which is like minimalist, and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel, which you can incorporate buttons into.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: You've maybe got, you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel,\nproject manager: On the Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel, and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel,\nproject manager: In the centre,\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: yeah, sure.\nuser interface: Mm yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting. In the meantime, the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: which I'll presume he'll work out what that means. Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation. And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Cool.\nproject manager: Is that all okay? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder, it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Cool, I'm gonna go and sit on my own.\nproject manager: Y ah nobody wants to talk to you.\nmarketing: I know, I'm hated.\nproject manager: Unplug yourself.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I've got a bit tangled up in all this {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with \nproject manager: I dunno, maybe I would car\nuser interface: we need to ", "en_query": "Summarize the decision discussion about key remote control concepts.", "zh_query": "总结遥控器最终会采用的关键设计概念。", "fr_query": "Résumez la discussion de décision sur les principaux concepts de contrôle à distance.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте обговорення рішень щодо ключових концепцій пульту дистанційного керування.", "en_summary": "They decided to implement a LCD display with a scroll wheel.

{"fname": "product_dev_122", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Right, I am going to tell you something about the components design. Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties. This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device. And the materials? Um I have heard several things, so I uh I'll have to change that on the way. But uh the case? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic. But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong.\nmarketing: Yeah, we should change that.\nindustrial designer: It should feel strong. So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient.\nproject manager: Well maybe it it it is,\nindustrial designer: We should move to uh something \nproject manager: but it doesn't look strong. So maybe \nindustrial designer: Well yeah. Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough, but it doesn't have a really really tough look. So \nmarketing: No no no.\nproject manager: But we still have to look at our price of course. Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Also Yeah. Mm-hmm. But we'll return to that.\nproject manager: Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Uh the buttons of course rubber, I think everyone agrees. And electrical cables, copper is all pretty basic stuff. The chips made of silicon, I guess. I think that's the best uh way to do it.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Then I've uh had a few findings, made a few findings. Uh the target audience product style. Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like, as you said, uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that. They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style. But of course that's not our uh things this. So this is things we must not do.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people, which is of course our uh group, the people we aim at. Um under forty five years old. Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours. Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said, that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking.\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But they like soft materials, uh so we might uh we have to consider that. And also they like curved round shapes. So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want. And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here, that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices, gaming devices, should define the characteristics of the device. But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device, so we don't really have to consider that.\nproject manager: Sports uh, they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh\nuser interface: Soccer fronts. Mm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Huh? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: That's nice. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: All the results?\nindustrial designer: Well I also have um several examples of uh styles,\nmarketing: We keep coming back to the fronts. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It was not very uh interesting uh, very classical looking,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Nai. Uh no.\nindustrial designer: but that's n that's not what we want.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: We have these kind of things. I don't know what exactly they are.\nmarketing: Fruity. Fruity.\nindustrial designer: It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's very primary colours, uh bright colours and uh round shapes.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You also uh see uh this device, it's not very round and Fruity of course. Yeah, it uh \nproject manager: It's t terrible.\nindustrial designer: That's true.\nproject manager: Alright.\nindustrial designer: And uh well round shapes, primary colours.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You can see it all here. And of course uh this famous device.\nproject manager: Hmm?\nindustrial designer: I think as you know something uh some devices like this.\nproject manager: Yeah, alright.\nindustrial designer: So to give you an idea of uh \nmarketing: Well it's got a strong look, this. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: This has a strong look. Although it's plastic, it's it's grey to to to give it iron look.\nmarketing: Yeah, it still has a strong look.\nproject manager: Yeah. And it's round.\nindustrial designer: That's uh \nmarketing: But then you are losing your fruity colours.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Well we have to make a \nproject manager: Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour. So uh those kind of things you can you can combine.\nmarketing: That's true.\nindustrial designer: Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control. I don't think that's very practical,\nproject manager: No, it isn't.\nindustrial designer: but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking, it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: 'Cause if you look at this, it it doesn't look very very strong,\nmarketing: Yeah but the \nindustrial designer: becau But this is plastic, and and this too, but \nmarketing: But it doesn't have to look strong. The the results are, the feel of the material is expected to be strongy.\nindustrial designer: The feel? Uh alright.\nmarketing: The feel.\nproject manager: So, if you ti\nindustrial designer: Well \nuser interface: And it it doesn't have to be strong, also.\nproject manager: Well \nmarketing: Nah yeah the feel \nproject manager: You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something.\nuser interface: Only the feel. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it it looks pretty but it feels strong.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Oh.\nindustrial designer: And I Then I have some more findings. Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device,\nmarketing: I agree.\nindustrial designer: uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery. I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course. But solar energy is not very practical inside a house, because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical, I think, for uh for a simple remote,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: that's a bit, oh, that's a bit uh That's a bit uh much.\nproject manager: No titanium. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium. That that's the information I received. If you use the curved case, uh a curved case, double curved then you can't use titanium.\nproject manager: What do you exactly mean with double curved?\nindustrial designer: Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: And uh now the the shape, yeah, a curved case. Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something. Uh a more modern look not plain, long box style, but \nmarketing: I dunno.\nproject manager: Double curved?\nindustrial designer: I'll draw it,\nproject manager: It it mean \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, well okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but maybe later.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape, than if you have uh . Um anyway \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um f as uh for the buttons, simple push buttons. No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that, because it makes more complex and expensive. And, uh as we agreed, we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device.\nmarketing: Yeah right. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Because it makes it also more complex and expensive. But we do use an L_C_D_ screen, so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip, which is more complex and expensive. But It's worth the trouble I think,\nproject manager: Well \nuser interface: The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material.\nindustrial designer: because \nuser interface: Because people like that.\nproject manager: This soft material thing from uh Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh rubber is a soft material, I guess.\nuser interface: Yeah.

Um, do you wanna start again?\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Let me \nindustrial designer: Right s {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we've got forty minutes.\nindustrial designer: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation,\nproject manager: You haven't made a PowerPoint, okay.\nindustrial designer: yeah, I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um mm, {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Let's hope the pen holds out. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: okay, so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components. Yeah. Okay, so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote, right? If you open it, you have a circuit board here, right,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here, which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here. If you flip the printed circuit board, and this is th the most important point here,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh everything else is kind of Okay, so if you flip the circuit board, this is what it looks like. So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: on pressing this button I a circuit completes, the information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation, which goes goes out through there. So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make, you can ge get them printed as you want to,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost, the way we want to have. Right? So that's the important point here,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so these are the different options that we have. Okay. So the batteries, I'll start with the battery, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells, yeah?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes, right? So. And dynamos. Um {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Does that mean like a wind-up one?\nindustrial designer: yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: A wind-up remote.\nindustrial designer: So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but these are the different things that the company makes, so th they'll they'll \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: since uh they'll come internally from the company, they'll be eas uh cheaper, uh all these options.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones.\nmarketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike, and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And charging their remote,\nmarketing: Yeah, and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing, 'cause that's just \nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's a good option.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So what was what was this k ka\nindustrial designer: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Uh yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. For a remote, 'cause you Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also made by the company.\nmarketing: Yay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Environment friendly. Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases, they can be flat, they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and they can be curved with on both the sides.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: These are the three options, right? Um \nuser interface: Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control, yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, would it be flat on both the sides, would be curved from one side, or whatever {vocalsound}\nuser interface: mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh there were different kind of supplements available, um like it can be in plastic, rubber, wood, or titanium, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Wo wo wood.\nmarketing: Did you say wool?\nproject manager: Wood, wood.\nmarketing: Wood. Oh right.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Not wool. {vocalsound}\nmarketing:.\nproject manager: A fluffy remote. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, you'll understand why when we get to my presenta.\nindustrial designer: Oh really? Okay. Um the \nproject manager: Huh.\nindustrial designer: so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment, so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use, because it relates to the overall image of the company, but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface. If we choose this, we cannot use titanium. For for these two we can use titanium, wood, rubber, or plastic.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh okay, the interface options now. So we can have push-buttons, like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Ooh. Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh \nmarketing: Sony.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, something like that.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: So, and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: The scroll plus push. So this is something that has been recently developed by the company, um in the last decade, so not too recent. And L_C_D_s, we can have L_C_D_s. So these two are recent and and this is q quite old.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: The various electronic options are um uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one, right? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive, so we can put put in uh whatever we want, but the various integrated circuit options are, we have either a simple one\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: or a regular or advanced. And uh the price goes up as we go down, obviously.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um okay, so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels. Right? Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender, which is did not explained what i what it was, but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker. So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know, as soon as you press a button, it it mm uh give gives you feedback, one five or whatever. Yeah, on.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not, but anyway.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So, these are the different options that we have. Okay, so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know, uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that, keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Excellent. Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board, so that if we need to \nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah.\nproject manager: you can sit down, but just we might need you to leap up.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: What are you, PowerPoint, or \nuser interface: Um I have some PowerPoint, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Oh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand?\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Some sort of radiation?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No it's got its little camera in there, plug it in .\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it should should do it. Yeah.\nmarketing: 'S a\nproject manager: Right, interface concept.\nuser interface: Okay. Um to be honest actually, I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time, I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk.\nproject manager: That's fine.\nuser interface: So um yeah, this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Okay. So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data. So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well, and colour, and so on.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant. Um and then um this uh this um this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So some findings um um. So in in the case of many user interfaces, they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing, it takes y know time to learn. Um okay, and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. Okay, some of them are here.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um well the picture is not very clear, but as you can see, there are actu oi, oh oh oh, {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: sorry for that. 'S go back.\nindustrial designer: That's nice one.\nuser interface: Ah, no, please. Okay, so yeah, they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one, because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice.\nmarketing: Ugly.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Um okay. So let's carry on with this. Um So uh um o other findings um some new things um used, uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh. Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait, no this is not the one. Okay, there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display.\nproject manager: It's yeah.\nuser interface: Um s another new development is a scroll button, which was also th also already mentioned. And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition, but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker, there can be a um pre-programmed answer, for example, you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever.\nproject manager: Uh-huh, hi yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include.\nindustrial designer: Uh sorry, uh can you go back for a second? Um uh are you sure wha what this means, a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display? Uh oh yeah are th\nproject manager: It's like the like you said, no? The scroll scroll wheel.\nmarketing: Yeah, you can't \nuser interface: No no, the scroll button is a different thing. I I have a picture if you just a moment, I'll I'll show you. I wasn't completely sure myself, but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel, it's like not separate buttons.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay, the iPod thing, yeah.\nuser interface: Look, this one here.\nmarketing: Oh, it's like the iPod.\nuser interface: But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round,\nmarketing: G yeah, no, you can.\nuser interface: it's like you press this or this or \nindustrial designer: Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh \nmarketing: It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse, and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Alright, right. Okay, okay.\nmarketing: and it yeah. It is \nindustrial designer: So instead of going down you just spin yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: You just go round\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and it is a bit weird at first, but it's actually very like fast.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Do you know, if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_, then it's a lot faster than the wheel,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: but you've got a lot less control over it.\nindustrial designer: Right. So maybe I should include that here as well,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: L_C_D_s um plus spinning.\nuser interface: Uh \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay, and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: It it has to be small, simple. Okay, we decided to include voice recognition, so to have the standard uh major buttons like on, off, um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen. Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button, I thought it could be for for voice like, I dunno, it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something. There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So yeah, that's uh that's it.\nproject manager: Excellent. Okay, straight to trends, and then we can discuss it all at once.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Okay, I've put the copy of the presentation in um the \nproject manager: The project documents.\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: Excellent. If you two could both do that as well, in case we need to refer to it.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Here it comes. Okay.\nmarketing: Fabulous. Okay, cool. Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay. Right. Now, the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect, which is twice as important as the third a aspect. So, I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: which I think given the target group is what you would expect, really.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um, you know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different, so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like, quite the thing to go for.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: And um, yeah it wants to look fancy, fancy look and feel.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here?\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right. So mm uh so it {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's over on the interface,\nindustrial designer: yeah,\nproject manager: if if you could put \nindustrial designer: so probably voice recognition is is kind of important, right?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um and an\nproject manager: And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning \nindustrial designer: yeah. Okay, I I have a point about L_C_D_,\nproject manager: so that means we need an advanced thing.\nindustrial designer: I dunno if it is the right point to take it up. W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback, right, to the user who's pressing buttons,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: and the feedback can come through television itself, so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote?\nmarketing: Depends how fast your television runs, really, don't don't you think? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait, and then it comes, so i it actually takes quite a long time. And if you get the number in wrong, then it's a bit of a pain,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right. \nmarketing: so I think, you know, a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that. But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen,\nmarketing: You know? Yeah.\nproject manager: so if you're watching something \nindustrial designer: That's true, yeah, that's also \nmarketing: And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on, and you could just see that on the remote rather than \nproject manager: Yeah. Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone, you know, like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control, you know or like a minimalist remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So you got your buttons one to nine, your on and off and your volume on that\nindustrial designer: Mm right.\nmarketing: and then if you want to mess about with it, you flip it open and,\nproject manager: And then you can flip it open.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: yeah.\nindustrial designer: So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and \nproject manager: Yeah, I think so.\nmarketing: Yeah, so that kind of decides your whole chip thing.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: You you agree? Maarika, yeah?\nuser interface: Yep, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Right.\nindustrial designer: So L_C_D_s, yeah, definitely.\nmarketing: Okay?\nindustrial designer: Go on.\nmarketing: Cool. Okay, apparently, fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sorry, I discovered clip art. Um so these will be an important feature for clothes, shoes and furniture. So I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, curviness. Do you know? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables. You know?\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and possibly even uneven,\nmarketing: Yeah, bit of asymmetry and stuff.\nproject manager: like not not symmet yeah.\nmarketing: But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Um yeah\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing:, I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Um \nproject manager: Something a bit squishy and \nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we we have\nmarketing: but I mean y you have to \nuser interface: So it could be like a rubbery \nindustrial designer: we have rubber,\nuser interface: yeah, uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using \nmarketing: Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, and it'd help if you drop it, it protects it as well.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: To some degree.\nindustrial designer: So if if we use uh latex cases, they won't allow us to use solar cells, as an energy source that is the constraint,\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: so um we could use titanium, wood or plastic uh or uh \nproject manager: Or if we want to use the the latex, then we have to go with one of the other um power things.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, w energy source.\nmarketing: If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there,\nproject manager: From from bouncing it.\nmarketing: you could just bounce it up and down.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, tap it on the desk, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You can have it as like a little ball to bounce, that flips open. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. Um so yeah, um okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm. So probably double curved surface is the way to go, yeah, .\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nindustrial designer: Or or curved at one end and flat on the top, because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides, then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons, etcetera. Um \nmarketing: You have to have a certain element of flatness, I think.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it, you know, it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much, does it?\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: It uh \nmarketing: No, I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference. I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: but it's curvy, so.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think uh \nproject manager: Yeah, 'cause the \nmarketing: Besides, you have four sides to a thing, so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: and, you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing?\nindustrial designer: Right. Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh\nproject manager: Dunno.\nindustrial designer: because um according to the information that I have, I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three. Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It does not say anything about uh whether technically, you know, this this stuff is available at all.\nproject manager: Nothing to open them.\nmarketing: Yeah. Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_, which I think is where it came from.\nindustrial designer: Right, yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: But no, my research didn't tell me anything, which is why we have all the pictures,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right. Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, cool.\nproject manager: Anything else? What've we got?\nmarketing: Uh combine style with a level of functionality, um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function.\nindustrial designer: Cool, thanks.\nproject manager: Okay, so.\nmarketing: Okay?\nuser interface: Thanks", "en_query": "Summarize the presentations on remote components, user interface and market trends.", "zh_query": "总结关于遥控器组件、用户界面和市场趋势的介绍。", "fr_query": "Résumez les présentations sur les composants distants, l'interface utilisateur et les tendances du marché.", "ukr_query": "Резюмувати презентації про компоненти пульту, інтерфейс користувача та тенденції ринку.", "en_summary": "Firstly, Industrial Designer presented on the remote components including the circuit board, the chip, the kinetic energy, the solar cell, the case shape and the interface.

{"fname": "product_dev_83", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Uh, at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want,\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to. And then, I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs, about uh what battery is in it, what kind of buttons also. First uh, the younger people, they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours. Like, totally yellow, totally red. Uh, so it's visible. Uh, the shapes are curved and round, like uh you also said. Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones, straight and uh flat and long. But to give him the shape of your hand, so you it's easier to use or something like that. But that's just an idea. And then, I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control. The battery, there are few options. Uh, I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery. So, everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket. Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch. When you uh shake it a few times, it it's loaded. Uh, the the form of the remote control, I think it's also nice have it curved. And maybe like it's hand-shaped. Uh, so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons. Uh material, you use plastic. Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time. And also rubber because the younger people like that, what we see in the research. Uh the push-buttons. We have one new thing uh discovered. It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse. Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels. When you want to go m move up, you just scroll up and click on the button, if you wanna see the next, uh if you wanna see that channel. And also for the mouse, uh for the volume, it's also uh easy to use. Just scroll a bit up, scroll a bit down. And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this, and you get it here. You can do it with your thumb. And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons\nmarketing: Hmm.", "en_query": "What did Industrial Designer say about the customers' taste?", "zh_query": "产品设计部对用户喜好有什么看法？", "fr_query": "Qu'a dit le designer industriel sur le goût des clients ?", "ukr_query": "Що сказав промисловий дизайнер про смаки клієнтів?", "en_summary": "Industrial Designer said that the younger people fancied soft materials and primary colors.

Наприклад, жовтий або червоний - примітні кольори. Форма може бути вигнутою і круглою для простого використання. Краще взяти просту батарею, щоб кожен міг купити її в супермаркеті, або використати кінетичну, щоб перезаряджати її звичайним струсом. Промисловий дизайнер запропонував в якості матеріалу використати жорсткий пластик та гуму, оскільки молоді це подобається. Опитування також виявило, що молодь віддає перевагу натисканням та прокрутці, як у мишці, для перемикання каналів та регулювання гучності звуку."}
