{"fname": "academic_dev_11", "dialogue": "grad e: I guess.\ngrad a: OK, we 're on. So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on, if you 're wearing a wireless.\ngrad e: Check one. Check one.\ngrad a: And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by, uh, watching the little bars change.\ngrad b: So, which is my bar? Mah! Number one.\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad e: Sibilance. Sibilance.\ngrad a: So, actually, if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now, as long as you 've signed the consent form, that's alright.\ngrad e: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time?\ngrad a: No. No.\ngrad e: Oh, OK.\ngrad a: Each individually. We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult. To try to read them while everyone else is.\ngrad e: Everyone would need extreme focus.\ngrad a: So, when you 're reading the digit strings, the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on.\nprofessor c: Other way. We m We may wind up with ver We we may need versions of all this garbage.\ngrad b: For our stuff. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Um. So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: So. You can see the transcript? There's two large number strings on the digits? So you would just read that one. And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines. And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins. And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first, so can see how that goes. Um. Again, I 'm not sure how much I should talk about stuff before everyone's here.\nprofessor c: Mmm. Well, we have one more coming.\ngrad a: OK. Well, why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there.\nprofessor c: OK. Well, we can start doing it.\ngrad a: Thanks. So, uh, just also a note on wearing the microphones. All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly, but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth, and then, at the corner. And that's so that you minimize breath sounds, so that when you 're breathing, you don't breathe into the mike. Um. Yeah, that's good. And uh So, everyone needs to fill out, only once, the speaker form and the consent form. And the short form I mean, you should read the consent form, but uh, the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts. So, if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public, which, these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them, uh, you 'll be given an opportunity by email, uh, to bleep out any portions you don't like. Um. On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can. If you 're not exactly sure about the region, we 're not exactly sure either. So, don't worry too much about it. The It's just self rating. Um. And I think that's about it. I mean, should I Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is?\nprofessor c: Um, yeah.\ngrad a: or?\nprofessor c: No. There was there was Let's see. Oh \ngrad e: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here?\ngrad b: I sent an email.\nprofessor c: She got an emai she was notified.\ngrad e: Oh yeah, she got an e Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Whether she knows is another question. Um. So are the people going to be identified by name?\ngrad a: Well, what we 're gonna we 'll anonymize it in the transcript. Um, but not in the audio.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: So the\nprofessor c: OK. So, then in terms of people worrying about, uh, excising things from the transcript, it's unlikely. Since it it does isn't attributed. Oh, I see, but the a but the but the \ngrad a: Right, so if I said, \" Oh, hi Jerry, how are you? \", we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Sure.\ngrad a: Um, so we will go through and, in the speaker ID tags there 'll be, you know, M - one O seven, M - one O eight.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: Um, but uh,\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: um, it w uh, I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio, and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data.\nprofessor c: OK. Mm - hmm. No, I I wasn't complaining,\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor c: I just wanted to understand.\ngrad a: Right.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad b: Well, we can make up aliases for each of us.\ngrad a: Yeah, I mean, whatever you wanna do is fine,\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad a: but we find that We want the meeting to be as natural as possible. So, we 're trying to do real meetings.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad a: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: and we don't want people to be editing what they say.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad a: So I think that it's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: You know?\nprofessor c: Right. Um, OK. So why don't you tell us briefly\ngrad a: OK. So th\nprofessor c: your give give your e normal schpiel.\ngrad a: Um. So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project. Um. So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future. This is a mock - up of one. Yes, we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood. Um. The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting, and record it, and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on, on the meeting. So that's my particular interest, is a portable device to do m uh, information retrieval on meetings. Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings. Um. So the first step on that, in any of these, is to collect some data. And so what we wanted is a room that's instrumented with both the table top microphones, and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes, as well as the close talking mikes. What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth, gives us, um, high quality audio, um, especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus. So, for people who are more interested in language, we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available. And then also, um, it's a very, very hard task in terms of speech recognition. Um. And so, uh, on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results. So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two. So that's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time. And then, all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like, um, beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that. Our intention is to release this data to the public, um, probably through f through a body like the LDC. And, uh, just make it as a generally available corpus. Um. There's other work going on in meeting recording. So, we 're we 're working with SRI, with UW, Um. NIST has started an effort which will include video. We 're not including video, obviously. And uh and then also, um, a small amount of assistance from IBM. Is also involved. Um. Oh, and the digit strings, this is just a more constrained task. Um. So because the general environment is so challenging, we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier. And it's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits, which is a common connected digits corpus. So we 'll have some, um, comparison to be able to be made.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad a: Anything else?\nprofessor c: No.\ngrad a: OK, so when the l last person comes in, just have them wear a wireless. It should be on already. Um. Either one of those. And uh, read the digit strings and and fill out the forms. So, the most important form is the consent form, so just be s be sure everyone signs that, if they consent.\ngrad b: I 'm sure it's pretty usual for meetings that people come late,\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad b: so you will have to leave what you set.\ngrad a: Right. And uh, just give me a call, which, my number's up there when your meeting is over.\nprofessor c: Yep.\ngrad a: And I 'm going to leave the mike here but it's n Uh, but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one. It 'll just be sitting here.\ngrad b: Input? Yeah. There we go.\nprofessor c: By the way, Adam, we will be using the, uh, screen as well.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor c: So, you know. Wow! Organization. So you guys who got email about this oh f uh, Friday or something about what we 're up to.\ngrad e: No.\ngrad f: No.\ngrad b: I got it.\ngrad e: What was the nature of the email?\nprofessor c: Oh, this was about um, inferring intentions from features in context, and the words, like \" s go to see \", or \" visit \", or some\ngrad b: Wel - we I uh I I \nprofessor c: You didn't get it?\ngrad e: I don't think I did.\nprofessor c: I guess these g have got better filters. Cuz I sent it to everybody. You just blew it off.\ngrad e: Ah.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad b: It's really simple though. So this is the idea. Um. We could pursue, um, if we thought it's it's worth it but, uh, I think we we will agree on that, um, to come up with a with a sort of very, very first crude prototype, and do some implementation work, and do some some research, and some modeling. So the idea is if you want to go somewhere, um, and focus on that object down Oh, I can actually walk with this. This is nice. down here. That's the Powder - Tower. Now, um, we found in our, uh, data and from experiments, that there's three things you can do. Um, you can walk this way, and come really, really close to it. And touch it. But you cannot enter or do anything else. Unless you 're interested in rock climbing, it won't do you no good standing there. It's just a dark alley. But you can touch it. If you want to actually go up or into the tower, you have to go this way, and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth. If you actually want to see the tower, and that's what actually most people want to do, is just have a good look of it, take a picture for the family, you have to go this way, and go up here. And there you have a vre really view It exploded, the during the Thirty years - war. Really uh, interesting sight. And um, these uh these lines are, um, paths,\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad b: or so That's ab er, i the street network of our geographic information system. And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part. Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take to lead people this way. It would always use the closest point to the object, and then the tourists would be faced, you know, in front of a wall, but it would do them absolutely no good. So, what we found interesting is, first of all, intentions differ. Maybe you want to enter a building. Maybe you want to see it, take a picture of it. Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building. For whatever reason that may be.\ngrad e: What's it what's it made out of?\ngrad b: Um, r red limestone.\ngrad e: So maybe you would wanna touch it.\ngrad b: Yeah, maybe you would want to touch it. Um. Okay, I This, um These intentions, we w w we could, if we want to, call it the the Vista mode, where we just want to eh s get the overview or look at it, the Enter mode, and the, well, Tango mode. I always come up with with silly names. So this \" Tango \" means, literally translated, \" to touch \". So But sometimes the the Tango mode is really relevant in the in the sense that, um, if you want to, uh If you don't have the intention of entering your building, but you know that something is really close to it, and you just want to approach it, or get to that building. Consider, for example, the Post Office in Chicago, a building so large that it has its own zip code. So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point. So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there. So, um, I 've looked, uh, through twenty some Uh, I didn't look through all the data. um, and there there's uh, a lot more different ways in people uh, the ways people phrase how to g get if they want to get to a certain place. And sometimes here it's b it's a little bit more obvious Um. Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the \nprofessor c: No, OK come in, sit down. If you grab yourself a microphone.\ngrad b: You need to sign some stuff and read some digits.\nprofessor c: Well, you can sign afterwards.\ngrad b: O or later.\ngrad e: You have to al also have to read some digits.\nprofessor c: Afterwards.\ngrad d: OK. OK. Afterwards is fine.\ngrad b: They are uncomfortable. Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: Really small? OK. I see. OK.\ngrad b: Yep.\ngrad d: Thank you.\ngrad b: OK, but that was our idea.\nprofessor c: And it it it it it also has to be switched on, Nance.\ngrad b: Is I I think \ngrad e: No, that one's already on, I thought he said.\nprofessor c: It's on? OK, good.\ngrad d: OK. It's on.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad b: OK. That was the idea. Um, people, when they w when they want to go to a building, sometimes they just want to look at it. Sometimes they want to enter it. And sometimes they want to get really close to it. That's something we found. It's just a truism. And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different. I I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where if you want to enter it. So, this is sort of how people may, uh may phrase those requests to a a a mock - up system at least that's the way they did it. And we get tons of of these \" how do I get to \", \" I want to go to \", but also, \" give me directions to \", and \" I would like to see \". And um, what we can sort of do, if we look closer a closer at the the data That was the wrong one. um, we can look at some factors that may make a difference. First of all, very important, and um, that I 've completely forgot that when we talked. This is of course a crucial factor, \" what type of object is it? \" So, some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of. Or very rarely. But you usually want to enter them. Some objects are more picturesque, and you more f more highly photographed. Then of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants. Um. Sometimes I found in the Uh, looking at the data, in a superficial way, I found some s sort of modifiers that that m may also give us a hint, um, \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh? \" I need to get to \". Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on. And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered. That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of of a phrase. So, this is, uh, really uh, uh, uh My suggestion is really simple. We start with, um Now, Let me, uh, say one more thing. What we do know, is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these. So, basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure. Sort of action \" go \", and then an object.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Yeah? and a source. So it's it's it's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions. So, I thought, \" Mmm! Maybe for a deep understanding task, that's a nice sort of playground or first little thing. \" Where we can start it and n sort of look \" OK, we need, we gonna get those M - three - L structures. The crude, undifferentiated parse. Interpreted input. We may need additional part of speech, or maybe just some information on the verb, and modifiers, auxiliaries. We 'll see. And I will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there, and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context. So this is not something which we can actually monitor, now, but just is something we can set. And then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program, depending on on what, um, comes out. We want to have an a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines. We 'd get an inferred intention, we we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista, the Enter, and the, um, Tango mode. Which I think we maybe want to ignore. But. That's my idea. It's up for discussion. We can change all of it, any bit of it. Throw it all away.\ngrad f: Now @ @ this email that you sent, actually.\nprofessor c: What?\ngrad f: Now I remember the email.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad e: Huh. Still, I have no recollection whatsoever of the email. I 'll have to go back and check.\nprofessor c: Not important. So, what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is. And, the the i uh, Robert and I talked about this some on Friday. And we think it's well - formed. So we think it's a well - formed, uh, starter task for this, uh, deeper understanding in the tourist domain.\ngrad f: So, where exactly is the, uh, deeper understanding being done? Like I mean, s is it before the Bayes - net? Is it, uh \nprofessor c: Well, it's the it's it's always all of it. So, in general it's always going to be, the answer is, everywhere. Uh, so the notion is that, uh, this isn't real deep. But it's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of, uh, going to see some tourist thing. And, so that's that's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at. And, Robert's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to Not only doesn't it do it, but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it. It isn't like, if you just took what the front - end gives you, and used some clever inference algorithm on it, you would be able to figure out which of these is going on. So, uh, and this is Bu - I in general it's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding, there's gonna be contextual things, there 're gonna be linguistic things, there 're gonna be discourse things, and they gotta be combined. And, my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net, although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better. Um, the idea would be that you, uh, take your You 're editing your slide?\ngrad b: Yeah. As i a sort of, as I get ideas, uh w uh.\nprofessor c: Oh.\ngrad b: So, discourse I I I thought about that. Of course that needs to sort of go in there.\nprofessor c: Oh. I 'm sorry. OK. So. This is minutes taking minutes as we go, in his in his own way.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor c: Um, but the p the Anyway. So the thing is, i uh, d naively speaking, you 've you 've got a for this little task, a belief - net, which is going to have as output, the conditional pr probability of one of three things, that the person wants to uh, to View it, to Enter it, or to Tango with it. Um. So that the the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed. And, then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things. And, then the question is there are two questions is, uh, one, where do you get this i information from, and two, what's the structure of the belief - net? So what are the conditional probabilities of this, that, and the other, given these things? And you probably need intermediate nodes. I we don't know what they are yet. So it may well be that, uh, for example, that, uh, knowing whether Oh, another thing you want is some information abou I think, about the time of day. Now, they may wanna call that part of context.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But the time of day matters a lot. And, if things are obviously closed, then, you \ngrad b: People won't want to enter it.\nprofessor c: Pe - people don't wanna enter them. And, if it's not obvious, you may want to actually uh, point out to people that it's closed you know, what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it.\ngrad b: s b\nprofessor c: So another thing that can come up, and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is, that another option of course is to have a more of a dialogue. So if someone says something you could ask them.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: OK. And Now, one thing you could do is always ask them, but that's boring. And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it. So one thing you could do is build a little system that, said, \" whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers. Ask them which one you want. \" OK. But that's, um, not what we 're gonna do.\ngrad b: But maybe that's a false state of the system, that it's too close to call.\nprofessor c: Oh yeah. You want the you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask, but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time, and i That's not getting at the scientific problem,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and it's In general you 're you know, it's gonna be much more complex than that. a This is purposely a really simple case.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So, uh Yeah.\ngrad b: I have one more point to to Bhaskara's question. Um, I think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we um, want it in terms of our modeling. We can start, you know, basic from human beings, model that, its motions, going, walking, seeing, we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives. That will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding.\nprofessor c: Yeah. S so so the way that might come up, if you wanna Suppose you wanted to do that, you might say, \" Um, as an intermediate step in your belief - net, is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved? \" OK? And if so, uh, is there a focus on the goal? Or is there a focus on the path? or something. And that could be, uh, one of the conditiona you know, th the In some piece of the belief - net, that could be the the appropriate thing to enter.\ngrad f: So, where would we extract that information from? From the M - three - L?\nprofessor c: No. No. See, the M - three - L is not gonna give th What he was saying is, the M - three - L does not have any of that. All it has is some really crude stuff saying, \" A person wants to go to a place. \"\ngrad f: Right.\ngrad e: The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output?\nprofessor c: Right. M - three well, M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language.\ngrad e: OK. It's just a language. Right, yeah.\nprofessor c: So we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to \ngrad b: The parser output?\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: \" Analyzed speech \" I think it's what they call it,\nprofessor c: Yeah. The Well, OK.\ngrad b: really, oder \nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: o th No, actually, intention lattices is what we 're gonna get.\nprofessor c: Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice, but tha\ngrad b: In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis.\nprofessor c: Anyway.\ngrad b: They call it intention hypotheses.\nprofessor c: Right. So, th they 're gonna give us some cr uh or We can assume that y you get this crude information. About intention, and that's all they 're going to provide. And they don't give you the kind of object, they don't give you any discourse history, if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else.\ngrad b: Well, they keep it. We have to request it.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad b: Nuh? But it's not in there.\nprofessor c: Well, they they kee they keep it by their lights.\ngrad b: Hmm.\nprofessor c: It may it may or may not be what what we want.\ngrad b: Yeah, or i\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: So, if someone says, \" I wanna touch the side of the Powder - Tower \", that would basically, we need to pop up Tango mode and the and the directions?\nprofessor c: If i if Yeah, if it got as simple as that, yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But it wouldn't.\ngrad e: OK. But that doesn't necessarily But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side, right?\ngrad b: Well Uh, th the there is a p a point there if I understand you. Correct? Um, because um, sometimes people just say things This you find very often. \" Where is the city hall? \" And this do they don't wanna sh see it on a map, or they don't wanna know it's five hundred yards away from you, or that it's to the your north. They wanna go there. That's what they say, is, \" Where is it? \". Where is that damn thing?\ngrad e: And the parser would output \ngrad b: Well, that's a a question mark. sh A lot of parsers, um, just, uh That's way beyond their scope, is of interpreting that. You know? But um, still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure, with the town hall and maybe saying it's a WH focus on the town hall. But to interpret it,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: you know? somebody else has to do that job later.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output, depending on these things.\ngrad b: Um, it will probably tell you how far away it is, at least that's That's even what Deep Map does. It tells you how far away it is, and and shows it to you on a map. Because i we can not differentiate, at the moment, between, you know, the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where where it is.\ngrad d: People no might not be able to infer that either, right? Like the fact Like, I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked, \" Where's the city hall? \", I might say, g ar \" Are you trying to get there? \" Because how I describe um, t its location uh, p probably depend on whether I think I should give them, you know, directions now, or say, you know, whatever, \" It's half a mile away \" or something like that.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm. It's a granularity factor,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: because where people ask you, \" Where is New York? \", you will tell them it's on the East Coast.\ngrad d: Uh - huh. Yeah. Exactly. Right. Right.\ngrad b: Y y eh you won't tell them how to get there, ft you know, take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad b: But if it's the post office, you will tell them how to get there.\ngrad d: Right. Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad b: So.\ngrad d: Right.\nprofessor c: But i Go go back to the the uh, th\ngrad b: So I w this is \" onto \" is is knowledge about buildings,\nprofessor c: Yeah, that slide.\ngrad b: their opening times, and then t coupled with time of day, um, this should You know.\ngrad d: So that context was like, um, their presumed purpose context, i like business or travel, as well as the utterance context, like, \" I 'm now standing at this place at this time \".\nprofessor c: Yeah, well I think we ought to d a As we have all along, d We we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context, which is what you have as context, and discourse context,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: which you have as DH,\ngrad b: Nuh.\nprofessor c: I don't know what the H means.\ngrad b: History. Discourse history. Yeah.\nprofessor c: OK. Whatever. So we can work out terminology later.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor c: So, they 're they 're quite distinct. I mean, you need them both, but they 're quite distinct. And, so what we were talking about doing, a a as a first shot, is not doing any of the linguistics. Except to find out what seems to be useful. So, the the the reason the belief - net is in blue, is the notion would be Uh, this may be a bad dis bad idea, but the idea is to take as a first goal, see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh, in a plausible way, given these We have all these transcripts and we 're able to, by hand, extract the features to put in the belief - net. Saying, \" Aha! here 're the things which, if you get them out of out of the language and discourse, and put them into the belief - net, it would tell you which of these three uh, intentions is most likely. \" And if to actually do that, build it, um you know, run it y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters. And see how that goes. If that goes well, then we can start worrying about how we would extract them. So where would you get this information? And, expand it to to other things like this. But if we can't do that, then we 're in trouble. I mean th th i i if you can't do this task, um \ngrad b: We need a different, uh, engine. Machine, I mean.\nprofessor c: Uh, uh, yeah, or something. Well it i I if it if it's the belief - nets, we we 'll switch to you know, logic or some terrible thing, but I don't think that's gonna be the case. I think that, uh, if we can get the information, a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it. The real issue is, do what are the factors involved in determining this? And I don't know.\ngrad b: Hmm. But, only w\nprofessor c: Hold on a s Hold on a second.\ngrad b: Muh.\nprofessor c: So, I know. Uh, uh, is it clear what's going on here?\ngrad f: Yep.\ngrad d: Um, I missed the beginning, but, um I guess could you back to the slide, the previous one? So, is it that it's, um These are all factors that uh, a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now? or that we want to take into account? You were saying n\nprofessor c: Take them into account. But but you don't worry about h\ngrad d: Take the the linguistic factors too. Oh, how to extract these features.\nprofessor c: how to extract them. So, f let's find out which ones we need first,\ngrad d: OK. Got it.\nprofessor c: and \ngrad d: OK. And and it's clear from the data, um, like, sorta the correct answer in each case.\nprofessor c: No.\ngrad d: But l\ngrad b: No. But \ngrad d: OK.\nprofessor c: Let's go back to th Let's go back to the the the slide of data.\ngrad d: That's that's the thing I 'm curious ab\ngrad b: Um \ngrad d: Like do we know from the data wh which OK. So \ngrad b: Not from that data. But, um, since we are designing a a a an, compared to this, even bigger data collection effort, um, we will definitely take care to put it in there,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: in some shape, way, form over the other,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: to see whether we can, then, get sort of empirically validated data.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad b: Um, from this, we can sometimes, you know an and that's that but that isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow? is sort of s sometimes when people want to just see it, they phrase it more like this? But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently, even if they still \ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Right.\ngrad b: you know?\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad b: But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net. So, um, this is exactly what \ngrad d: Right.\ngrad b: Because y you can never be sure. And I 'm sure even i the most, sort of, deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say, \" Well, if it's phrased like that, the intention is this. \"\ngrad d: Sure.\ngrad b: You know, because then, uh, you \ngrad d: u u I mean, the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task. Right? Where you have where your, uh, current goal is to \ngrad b: We Yeah! That's what we 're doing.\ngrad d: \ngrad b: But but we will still get the phrasing all over the place.\ngrad d: So that's what you want? OK. So you will know.\ngrad b: I 'm sure that, you know \nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. The No, that's fine. I guess, it's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: From that task, yeah. So, uh, I think you all know this, but we are going to actually use this little room\ngrad d: \nprofessor c: and start recording subjects probably within a month or something. So, this is not any lo any of you guys ' worry, except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need. So our job is to figure out how to solve these problems. If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort, then the sort of data collection branch can be, uh, asked to do that. And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh, recording of subjects. So, yeah y you 're absolutely right, though. No, you you will not have, and there it is, and, uh But you know, y y the, um \ngrad d: And I think the other concern that has come up before, too, is if it's um I don't know if this was collected what situation this data was collected in. Was it is it the one that you showed in your talk? Like people \ngrad b: No, no. No.\ngrad d: But OK. So was this, like, someone actually mobile, like s using a device?\ngrad b: Uh, N no, no not i it was mobile but not not with a w a real wizard system. So there were never answers.\ngrad d: Uh - huh. OK. OK. But, is it I guess I don't know The situation of of collecting th the data of, like Here you could imagine them being walking around the city. as like one situation. And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret, like you said, the scope and things like that.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: If they 're doing it in a you know, \" I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions \", I I would imagine that the data would be really different. Um, so it's just \ngrad b: Yeah. But It was never th th the goal of that data collection to to serve for sat for such a purpose. So that's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: there was n there was no label,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: you know, intention A, intention B, intention C.\ngrad d: Right.\ngrad b: Or task A, B, C. Um I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it, um, that that will help us along those lines.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: But, you know, you gotta leave something for other people to model. So, to Finding out what, you know, situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are, you know is an interesting s interesting thing.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: u u Sort of I 'm, at the moment, curious and I 'm I 'm s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: what suffices and what doesn't. And then we can start worrying about where to get this input, what what do we need, you know Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser, for example, maybe, there's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever, part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Hmm.\ngrad b: It's a m pragmatic approach, uh, at the moment.\ngrad e: How exactly does the data collection work? Do they have a map, and then you give them a scenario of some sort?\ngrad b: OK. Imagine you 're the the subject. You 're gonna be in here, and somebody And and you see, uh, either th the three - D model, or uh, a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg. So you actually see that. Um. The uh, um, first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg. So, just off a textbook, uh, tourist guide, to familiarize, uh, yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names, like Fischergasse and so forth. So that's part one. Part two is, you 're told that this huge new, wonderful computer system exists, that can y tell you everything you want to know, and it understands you completely. And so you 're gonna pick up that phone, dial a number, and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve. First you have to know find out how to get to that place, maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there. Maybe So, the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild. The third one is to get information on the history of an object. The fourth one And then the g system breaks down. It crashes, And \ngrad d: a At the third? Right then?\ngrad b: After the third task.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad b: And then Or after the fourth. Some find @ @ Forget that for now. And then, a human operator comes on, and and exp apologizes that the system has crashed, but, you know, urges you to continue, you know? now with a human operator. And so, you have basically the same tasks again, just with different objects, and you go through it again, and that was it. Oh, and one one little bit w And uh, the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are, via GPS. When the human operator comes on, um, that person does not know. So the GPS is crashed as well. So the person first has to ask you \" Where are you? \". And so you have to do some s tell the person sort of where you are, depending on what you see there. Um, this is a a a a a bit that I d I don't think we Did we discuss that bit? Uh, I just sort of squeezed that in now. But it's something, uh, that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know. So.\ngrad d: So, in the display you can Oh, you said that you cou you might have a display that shows, like, the \ngrad b: Yeah. a Additionally, y you have a a a sort of a map type display.\ngrad d: a w your perspective? sort of?\ngrad b: Uh, two - D.\ngrad d: And so, as you \ngrad b: n\ngrad d: Oh, two - D. OK.\ngrad b: Two - D.\ngrad d: So as you move through it that's - they just track it on the for themselves\ngrad b: Yeah. b y You don't That's \ngrad d: there.\ngrad b: I don't know. I but y I don't think you really move, sort of.\ngrad d: OK. So\ngrad b: Yeah? I mean that would be an an an enormous technical effort, unless we would We can show it walks to, you know. We can have movies of walking, you walking through through Heidelberg, and u ultimately arriving there.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Maybe we wanna do that. Yeah.\ngrad d: Uh, I was just trying to figure out how how ambitious the system is.\ngrad b: The map was sort of intended to You want to go to that place. You know, and it's sort of there.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: And you see the label of the name So we get those names, pronunciation stuff, and so forth, and we can change that.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. So your tasks don't require you to I mean, uh yo you 're told So when your task is, I don't know, \" Go buy stamps \" or something like that? So, do you have to respond? or does your Uh, what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system? Like, w what you 're doing now? or \ngrad b: Well, we 'll see what people do.\ngrad d: There's no OK, so it's just like, \" Let's figure out what they would say under the circumstances \".\ngrad b: Yeah, and and we will record both sides. I mean, we will record the Wi - the Wizard \ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad b: I mean, in both cases it's gonna be a human, in the computer, and in the operator case.\ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad b: And we will re there will be some dialogue, you know? So, you first have to do this, and that,\ngrad d: Yep.\ngrad b: and and \ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: see wh what they say. We can ins instruct the, uh, wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be. But um, maybe the maybe what you 're suggesting Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor, the data, if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh, task results in a question and then there's an answer and that's the end of the task? You wanna m have it more more steps, sort of?\ngrad d: Yeah, I I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction I mean, th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: All they know is it's this great system that could do s stuff.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Oh yeah, but to some extent this is a different discussion.\ngrad d: Right? So \nprofessor c: OK? So. Uh, we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment, and the data collection, and all that sorta stuff\ngrad d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: and we do have, um, a student who is a candidate for wizard. Uh, she's gonna get in touch with me. It's a student of Eve's. FEY, Fey? Spelled FEY. Do you do you \ngrad d: Oh, Fey Parrill.\nprofessor c: You know her?\ngrad d: Yeah. Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: OK. Sh - Is sh\ngrad d: She started taking the class last year and then didn't um, you know, didn't continue. I g She's a g\nprofessor c: She's graduated.\ngrad d: Is she an undergradua She is a graduate, OK.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad d: Yeah, I m I know her very, very briefly. I know she was inter you know, interested in aspect and stuff like that.\nprofessor c: OK. So, anyway, she's looking for some more part time work w while she's waiting actually for graduate school. And she 'll be in touch. So we may have someone, uh, to do this, and she's got you know, some background in in all this stuff. And is a linguist st and, so So. That's So, Nancy, we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know, how that's gonna go.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And um, Jane, but also, uh, Liz have offered to help us do this, uh, data collection and design and stuff.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mmm.\nprofessor c: So, when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing.\ngrad d: OK. I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that, um, it's one thing to collect data for, I don't know, speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers, but with intention um, obviously, as you point out, there's a lot of di other factors and I 'm not really sure, um, how how e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that Um, it's ju it's just hard. So, I mean, obviously it's a \ngrad e: Yeah, uh, actually I guess that was my question. Is the intention implicit in the scenario that's given? Like, do the \ngrad d: It is, if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to \ngrad e: Yeah, I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was.\ngrad d: to to give Yeah,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: uh \ngrad b: n No one is, at the moment.\ngrad d: Right. Right.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: So, we that's part of what we 'll have to figure out.\ngrad d: Right.\nprofessor c: But, uh,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: the The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was, let's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which, one way or the other, you were able to, uh, figure out both the intention, and set the context, and know what language was used. So let's suppose that we can get that kind of data. Um. The issue is, can we find a way to, basically, featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that, uh, when we know the values to all those features, or as many as possible, we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the, in this case three little intentions, are most likely.\ngrad d: w What are the t three intentions? Is it to go there, to see it, and \ngrad b: To come as close as possible to it.\nprofessor c: Th - the terminology we 're using is to \ngrad d: Yeah, it's @ @.\nprofessor c: Go back. To v\ngrad d: OK.\nprofessor c: to View it. OK? To Enter it. Now those It seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct. \" Take a picture of it \" you you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And, for an object that's at all big, uh, sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh, could be quite different than either of those.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Just sort of \ngrad d: OK, so now I understand the referent of Tango mode. I didn't get that before.\ngrad e: See, I would have thought it was more of a waltz.\ngrad b: S To \" Waltz \" it?\ngrad d: Yeah, like, how close are you gonna be?\nprofessor c: Well.\ngrad d: Like, Tango's really close.\ngrad e: Yeah, cuz a tango Yeah.\nprofessor c: Well, anyway. So \ngrad f: All these So, like, the question is how what features can like, do you wanna try to extract from, say, the parse or whatever?\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: Like, the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh, stem, or certain construction or whatever.\nprofessor c: Right. Is there a construction, or the kind of object, or w uh, anything else that's in the si It's either in the in the s the discourse itself or in the context. So if it turns out that, whatever it is, you want to know whether the person's uh, a tourist or not, OK? that becomes a feature. Now, how you determine that is another issue. But fo for the current problem, it would just be, \" OK, if you can be sure that it's a tourist, versus a businessman, versus a native, \" or something, uh, that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said, \" pppt! \" Though sin f in the short run, you 'd set them,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and see ho how it worked, and then in the longer run, you would figure out how you could derive them. From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew.\ngrad f: Right. So, how should What's the uh, plan? Like, how should we go about figuring out these \nprofessor c: OK. So, first of all is, uh, do e either of you guys, you got a favorite belief - net that you 've, you know, played with? JavaBayes or something?\ngrad f: Oh. No, not really.\nprofessor c: OK. Well, anyway. f Get one. OK? So y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually, uh, pick a package, doesn't matter which one, uh, presumably one that's got good interactive abilities, cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d You know, we don't need the one that 'll solve massive, uh, belief - nets quickly. d w These are not gonna get big in in the foreseeable future. But we do want one in which it's easy to interact with and, uh, modify. Because i that's A lot of what it's gonna be, is, um, playing with this. And probably one in which it's easy to have, um, what amounts to transcript files. So that if if we have all these cases OK? So we make up cases that have these features, OK, and then you 'd like to be able to say, \" OK, here's a bunch of cases \" There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK? So you have all their cases and and their results and you have a algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the the probabilities for you. Um, probably that's not worth it. I mean, my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that's good enough to make the these data fitting ones worth it, but I don't know. So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um, pick a package. OK, and you wanna it s You know, the standard things you want it stable, you want it yeah, @ @. And, as soon as we have one, we can start trying to, uh, make a first cut at what's going on.\ngrad b: An - Nuh.\nprofessor c: But it what I like about it is it's very concrete. OK? We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be, and we have some some data that's loose, we can use our own intuition, and see how hard it is, and, importantly, what intermediate nodes we think we need. So it if it turns out that just, thinking about the problem, you come up with things you really need to You know, this is the kind of thing that is, you know, an intermediate little piece in your belief - net. That 'd be really interesting.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: And it and it may serve as a platform for a person, maybe me, or whoever, who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis. I mean, w we have the For - FrameNet group here, and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already, that are contained in the data, um, you know, to come up with a nice little set of features and um, maybe even means of s uh, extracting them. And and that altogether could also be uh, become a nice paper that's going to be published somewhere, if we sit down and write it. And um When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee? or that are in the program language Java?\nprofessor c: No, th It turns out that there is a, uh The new end of Java libraries. OK, and it turns out one called\ngrad b: Mmm. OK.\nprofessor c: Which is one that fair people around here use a fair amount. I have no idea whether that's  The obvious advantage of that is that you can then, relatively easily, get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So that i that's I think why a lot of people doing research use that. But it may not be I have no idea whether that's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around, students in the department who, you know, live and breathe Bayes - nets. So, uh,\ngrad d: There's the m tool kit that um, Kevin Murphy has developed,\nprofessor c: Right. It's OK.\ngrad d: which might be useful too.\ngrad f: Right.\nprofessor c: So, yeah, Kevin would be a good person to start with.\ngrad d: And it's available Matlab code.\nprofessor c: Nancy knows him well. I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: but, uh \ngrad f: Yeah, I know him.\ngrad b: But i But since we all probably are pretty sure that, um, the \nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: For example, this th th the dialogue history is is um, producing XML documents. M - three - L of course is XML. And the ontology that um, uh the student is is constructing for me back in in EML is in OIL and that's also in XML. And so that's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries, about hotels, about castles and stuff is gonna come from.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\ngrad b: Um, so, if it has that IO capability and if it's a Java package, it will definitely be able We can couple.\nprofessor c: Yeah. So, yeah, we 're sort of committed to XML as the kind of, uh, interchange. But that's, you know, not a big deal.\ngrad b: Who isn't, nuh?\nprofessor c: So, in terms of of interchanging in and out of any module we build, It 'll be XML. And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology, for example, you 'll have to deal with its interface. But that's that's fine an and um, all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind. So they they have worked very hard. It's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth. So, that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet. I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work, in a way that we 're comfortable with, then we ca we can get in and out of it with, uh, XML, um, little descriptors. I believe.\ngrad b: Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I like, for example, the what you said about the getting input from from just files about where you h where you have the data, have specified the features and so forth.\nprofessor c: I don't I don't see \ngrad b: That's, of course, easy also to do with, you know, XML.\nprofessor c: Uh, you could have an X yeah, you could make and XML format for that. Sure.\ngrad b: So r\nprofessor c: That that um, you know, feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any. So it's als Yeah, I guess it's also worth, um, while you 're poking around, poke around for XML packages that um, do things you 'd like.\ngrad f: Doesn't does SmartKom system have such packages?\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Sure.\ngrad b: The the lib M - three - L library does that. It's also \nprofessor c: And the question is, d you c you you 'll have to l We 'll have to l That should be ay We should be able to look at that \ngrad b: No, u u y um the What I What sort of came to my mind i is was the notion of an idea that if if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own, um, probability factors based on on on on input \nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: which is in file format, if we, um, get really w wild on this, we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made and, for example, if if they are in in MATE, then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations, t you know, t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Um, Michael has a project where you know, recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE, and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data. So if we w if we think it's worth it one of these days, not not with this first prototype but maybe with a second, and we have the possibility of of taking input that's generated elsewhere and learn from that, that 'd be nice.\ngrad f: Right.\nprofessor c: It 'd be nice, but but I I I do I don't wanna count on it. I mean, you can't you can't run your project based on the speculation that that the data will come,\ngrad b: No, no, uh, just for \nprofessor c: and you don't have to actually design the nets.\ngrad b: Nuh. Just a back door that I I think we should devote m\nprofessor c: Could happen. Yeah. So in terms of of the, um the what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages, it could be that they 're fine, or it could be eeh. You don't You know, you don't really like it. So we 're not we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages. We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format, but hey.\ngrad f: Right.\nprofessor c: Um, it's, uh It doesn't control what you do in you know, internally.\ngrad b: \ngrad e: What's the time frame for this?\ngrad b: Two days? Two, three days?\nprofessor c: Huh? Yeah bu w I 'd like that this y yeah, this week, to ha to n to have y guys, uh, you know, pick the y you know, belief - net package\ngrad b: No.\nprofessor c: and tell us what it is, and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something.\ngrad f: Sure.\nprofessor c: And, then as soon as we have it, I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem. Make a first cut at, you know, what's going on, and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way. I mean, you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or You know, how\ngrad b: Uh I I I um, OK, I t Yeah. I was actually more joking. With the two or three days. So this was was a usual jo\nprofessor c: OK, I wasn't.\ngrad b: Um, it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Right.\ngrad b: But um, maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who's gonna be the speaker next Monday, to tell us something about the net you picked, and what it does, and how it does that.\nprofessor c: Well, y Well, or both of them speak.\ngrad f: Sure.\ngrad b: Yeah, or you can split it up.\nprofessor c: We don't care.\ngrad b: So, y\ngrad f: Hmm.\ngrad b: So that will be sort of the assignment for next week, is to to for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and and how far you 've gotten. Pppt!\nprofessor c: Well, I 'd like to also, though, uh, ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like. Even if it's really crude. OK? So, you know, here a here are \ngrad e: So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot,\nprofessor c: Right. Yeah.\ngrad e: and \ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And, as I said, what I 'd like to do is, I mean, what would be really great is you bring it in If if if we could, uh, in the meeting, say, you know, \" Here's the package, here's the current one we have, \" uh, you know, \" What other ideas do you have? \" and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file. Of, uh, you know, get a t a p tentative format for it, let's say XML, that says, l you know, \" These are the various scenarios we 've experienced. \" We can just add to that and there 'll be this this file of them and when you think you 've got a better belief - net, You just run it against this, um this data file.\ngrad f: So we 'll be like, hand, uh, doing all the probabilities.\nprofessor c: Oh, yeah, unt until we know more.\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad e: And what's the relation to this with Changing the table so that the system works in English?\ngrad b: OK. So this is Whi - while you were doing this, I received two lovely emails. The the full NT and the full Linux version are there. I 've downloaded them both, and I started to unpack the Linux one Uh, the NT one worked fine. and I started unta pack the Linux one, it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date. So this is the time difference between Germany. I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it. Now, um Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine. And so that we have it. And then um Hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along, we I control p Maybe that's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Yeah. So the answer, Johno, is that these are, at the moment, separate. Uh, what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works, we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net.\ngrad e: I guess my question was more about time frame. So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week, and then \nprofessor c: Oh, yeah. I don't know. n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line, in the sense that over the next month there's a there's a deliverable.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: OK. S so uh, it's opportu in that sense it's opportunistic. If if you know, if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around, you know, wasting time, trying to do the problem or guess what they You know, just pppt! go on and do other things.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad b: Yeah, but uh but the uh This point is really I think very, very valid that ultimately we hope that that both will merge into a harmonious and, um, wonderful, um, state where we can not only do the bare necessities, IE, changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German, but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say, \" OK, this is what it usually does, and now we add this little thing to it \", you know? whatever, Johno's and Bhaskara's great belief - net, and we plug it in, and then for these certain tasks, and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system, it all all of a sudden it does much better. Nuh? Because it can produce better answers, tell the person, as I s showed you on this map, n you know, produce either you know, a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door, which would be great. So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately, if you produce a system like this, it takes the person where it wants to go. Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building,\ngrad f: Mmm.\ngrad b: which is what they do now. And we even had to take out a bit. Nancy, you missed that part. We had to take out a bit of the road work. So that it doesn't take you to the wall every time.\ngrad d: Oh, really?\ngrad b: So. Um So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered, which nobody have has because car navigation systems don't really care. You know, they get you to the beginning of the street, some now do the house number.\ngrad d: Hmm.\ngrad b: But even that is problematic.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf, I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft, it takes you to the the address, whatever, street number blah - blah - blah, you are miles away from the entrance.\nprofessor c: Yep.\ngrad b: Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere. Nuh?\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different. So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there.\ngrad d: Right, yeah.\nprofessor c: Probably not then, cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway.\ngrad b: Probably neither e not even that.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Clear?\ngrad f: OK. Sounds good.\ngrad e: The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone.\ngrad d: I was wondering.\ngrad b: Do you wanna see a picture?\ngrad d: OK. Sure!\ngrad e: Sure!\ngrad b: Have to reboot for that though.\ngrad d: Um. So, you two, who 'll be working on this, li are are you gl will you be doing Well, I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation? Can you use the sample data?\nprofessor c: Of course they use the sample data.\ngrad d: Is it like Yeah, I mean, ho is there more than Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you what you have there?\ngrad b: There there's more than I showed, but um, um, I think this is sort of um, in part my job to look at that and and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted,\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad b: and to come up with some features that are not you know, empirically based on on a real experiment or on on on reality\ngrad d: Right. Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: but sort of on your intuition of you know, \" Aha! This is maybe a sign for that,\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: and this is maybe a sign for this. \"\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So, yeah. Later this week we should sort of get together, and sort of start thinking about that, hopefully.\ngrad b: Talk features. Yep.\nprofessor c: OK. We can end the meeting and call Adam, and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg. We can do that as well.\ngrad b: Well they had they used the ammunition They stored the ammunition in that tower.\nprofessor c: Uh, is that OK?\ngrad b: And that's why, when it was hit by uh, a cannon ball, it exploded.\nprofessor c: Alright. Oh. Ni\ngrad e: It exploded. That's why they call it the Powder - Tower.\ngrad b: Ahh.\ngrad e: OK.

{"fname": "academic_dev_45", "dialogue": "phd a: Yeah. f But, yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh. But it's another thing to try.\nphd a: So, this is w w i wa wa this is one thing, this this could be could help could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches, like, well, the Kleinschmidt approach. So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database. I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: and So this is one approach and the other is multi - band uh, that I think is more robust to the noisy changes.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So perhaps, I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh, features - based targets could could could help.\nprofessor d: Yeah, if you i i It's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up I mean w yeah, one one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have um some reasonable database, um but then which is um copied over many times with a range of different noises,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: And uh If Cuz what you 're trying to do is come up with a a core, reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used uh, by the the uh HMM system.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: So. Yeah, OK.\nphd a: So, um, yeah. The future work is, well, try to connect to the to make to plug in the system to the OGI system. Um, there are still open questions there, where to put the MLP basically.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor d: And I guess, you know, the the the real open question, I mean, e u there's lots of open questions, but one of the core quote \" open questions \" for that is um, um, if we take the uh you know, the best ones here, maybe not just the best one, but the best few or something You want the most promising group from these other experiments. Um, how well do they do over a range of these different tests, not just the Italian?\nphd a: Mmm,\nprofessor d: Um. And y\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor d: y Right? And then um then see, again, how We know that there's a mis there's a uh a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than, uh we 're gonna test on, but well, if you look over a range of these different tests um, how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features, uh stand up over that range?\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: That's that that seems like the the the real question. And if you know that So if you just take PLP with uh, the double - deltas. Assume that's the p the feature. look at these different ways of combining it. And uh, take let's say, just take uh multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: And just look take that case and then look over all the different things. How does that How does that compare between the \nphd a: So all the all the test sets you mean, yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: All the different test sets,\nphd a: And \nprofessor d: and for and for the couple different ways that you have of of of combining them.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um. How well do they stand up, over the \nphd a: Mmm. And perhaps doing this for cha changing the variance of the streams and so on getting different scaling \nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: That's another possibility if you have time, yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: Um. Yeah, so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the to their diagram.\nprofessor d: \nphd a: Cuz Yeah. Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn, they they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn, that discriminates,\nprofessor d: Yeah. It's a little strange\nphd a: or? Mmm?\nprofessor d: but on the other hand they did it before.\nphd a: Mmm. And and and\nprofessor d: Um the\nphd a: yeah. And because also perhaps we know that the when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help. So. I don't know.\nprofessor d: Um, the other thing, though, is that um So. Uh, we we wanna get their path running here, right? If so, we can add this other stuff.\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor d: as an additional path right?\nphd a: Yeah, the the way we want to do \nprofessor d: Cuz they 're doing LDA RASTA.\nphd a: The d What?\nprofessor d: They 're doing LDA RASTA,\nphd a: Yeah, the way we want to do it perhaps is to just to get the VAD labels and the final features.\nprofessor d: yeah?\nphd a: So they will send us the Well, provide us with the feature files,\nprofessor d: I see. I see.\nphd a: and with VAD uh, binary labels so that we can uh, get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream. So.\nprofessor d: I see. So we So. First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them. Without putting in a second path.\nphd a: Uh. You mean Oh, yeah! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK?\nprofessor d: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we have we understand properly what things are, our very first thing to do is to is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK.\nphd a: Oh yeah. Yeah, OK. Mmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh, I mean, I don't know that we need to r\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um Do we need to retrain I mean we can just take the re their training files also. But. But, uh just for the testing, jus just make sure that we get the same results so we can duplicate it before we add in another \nphd a: Mmm. OK.\nprofessor d: Cuz otherwise, you know, we won't know what things mean.\nphd a: Oh, yeah. OK. And um. Yeah, so fff, LogRASTA, I don't know if we want to We can try networks with LogRASTA filtered features.\nprofessor d: Maybe.\nphd a: Mmm. I 'm sorry? Yeah. Well Yeah. But \nprofessor d: Oh! You know, the other thing is when you say comb I 'm I 'm sorry, I 'm interrupting. that u Um, uh, when you 're talking about combining multiple features, um Suppose we said, \" OK, we 've got these different features and so forth, but PLP seems pretty good. \" If we take the approach that Mike did and have \nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: I mean, one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions. We have different languages, we have different different noises, Um If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps with them.\nphd a: \nprofessor d: And put put them together. What what What Mike found, for the reverberation case at least, I mean I mean, who knows if it 'll work for these other ones. That you did have nice interpolative effects. That is, that yes, if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that, then you got the best results. But if you had, say, a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case, uh, and then you fed the thing, uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two. So it was sort of behaved reasonably. Is tha that a fair Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. So you you think it's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but \nprofessor d: It works better if what?\nphd a: Yea\nprofessor d: I see. Well, see, i oc You were doing some something that was So maybe the analogy isn't quite right. You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved. You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh, uh, reverberation. Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data. But we have s f for this kind of task, I would think, sort of a modest amount. I mean, a million frames actually isn't that much. We have a modest amount of of uh training data from a couple different conditions, and then uh in yeah, that and the real situation is that there's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language, and noise type uh, and uh, uh, channel characteristic, sort of all over the map. A bunch of different dimensions. And so, I 'm just concerned that we don't really have um, the data to train up I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in we still don't have a good explanation for this, but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh, a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh, when we just take one of those databases that's a pretty good one, it actually is is is is is better. And uh that says to me, yes, that, you know, there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that. But one way or another we don't have uh, seemingly, the ability to represent, in the neural net of the size that we have, um, all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering. So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that um, this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making, which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets, uh, that uh if we if they look at more constrained conditions they they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nphd a: So doing both is is not is not right, you mean, or? Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah. I I just sort of have a feeling \nphd a: But Yeah. Mm - hmm. \nprofessor d: Yeah. I mean i i e The um I think it's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA RASTA, which is a kind of LogRASTA, it's just that they have the I mean it's done in the log domain, as I recall, and it's it uh it's just that they d it's trained up, right? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization. So they did At least in their case, it did seem to be somewhat complimentary. So will it be in our case, where we 're using the neural net? I mean they they were not not using the neural net. Uh I don't know. OK, so the other things you have here are uh, trying to improve results from a single Yeah. Make stuff better. OK. Uh. Yeah. And CPU memory issues. Yeah. We 've been sort of ignoring that, haven't we?\nphd a: Yeah, so I don't know.\nprofessor d: But \nphd a: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we \nprofessor d: Yeah, but I li Well, I think My impression You you folks have been looking at this more than me. But my impression was that uh, there was a a a a strict constraint on the delay,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better, and using less CPU was better. Something like that,\nphd a: Yeah, but \nprofessor d: right?\nphd a: Yeah. So, yeah, but we 've I don't know. We have to get some reference point to where we Well, what's a reasonable number? Perhaps be because if it's if it's too large or large or @ @ \nprofessor d: Um, well I don't think we 're um completely off the wall. I mean I think that if we if we have Uh, I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do If we find uh I mean we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know, if the MLP ultimately, after all is said and done, doesn't really help then we won't have it in.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: If the MLP does, we find, help us enough in some conditions, uh, we might even have more than one MLP. We could simply say that is uh, done on the uh, server.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: And it's uh We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that. So, I I I think I think that's  that's OK.\nphd a: And Yeah.\nprofessor d: So I think the key thing was um, this plug into OGI. Um, what what are they What are they gonna be working Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features,\nphd a: They 're They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band.\nprofessor d: and?\nphd a: So. Um This that was Pratibha. Sunil, what was he doing, do you remember?\nphd b: Sunil?\nphd a: Yeah. He was doing something new or?\nphd b: I I don't re I didn't remember. Maybe he's working with neural network.\nphd a: I don't think so. Trying to tune wha networks?\nphd b: Yeah, I think so.\nphd a: I think they were also mainly, well, working a little bit of new things, like networks and multi - band, but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now to just trying to get the best from this this architecture.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: \nprofessor d: OK. So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get There 'd be some point where you say, \" OK, this is their version - one \" or whatever, and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: and then um, uh, that's what we work with. We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then um, uh, when it gets to be uh, January some point uh, we say, \" OK we we have shown that we can improve this, in this way. So now uh um what's your newest version? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that's better and then we we 'd combine it. This is always hard. I mean I I I used to work with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh, HMM system with uh with a neural net system and uh, it was a common problem that you 'd Oh, and this Actually, this is true not just for neural nets but just for in general if people were working with uh, rescoring uh, N - best lists or lattices that come came from uh, a mainstream recognizer. Uh, You get something from the the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring. But they 're working really hard, too. So by the time you have uh, improved their score, they have also improved their score\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: and now there isn't any difference,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: because the other \nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So, um, I guess at some point we 'll have to\nphd a: So it's \nprofessor d: uh  Uh, I I don't know. I think we 're we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases. I think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing we can we e e\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things, presumably uh, in a in a day we could turn around uh, taking a new set of things from them and and rescoring it,\nphd a: Mmm. Yeah. Yeah, perhaps we could.\nprofessor d: right? So. Yeah. Well, OK. No, this is I think this is good. I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh, you know, different trainings. You know, da training targets and noises and so forth.\nphd a: Mmm. So we we can for we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps,\nprofessor d: That's sort of wide open.\nphd a: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and?\nprofessor d: Yeah, I think for right now um, I th I I really liked MSG. And I think that, you know, one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties. And um, I think that there is ultimately a really good uh, potential for, you know, bringing in things with different temporal properties. Um, but um, uh, we only have limited time and there's a lot of other things we have to look at.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets, and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing, and, you know, with limited time. Yeah. I think we have to start cutting down.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: So uh I think so, yeah. And then, you know, once we Um, having gone through this process and trying many different things, I would imagine that certain things uh, come up that you are curious about uh, that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh, I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most, you know, got you most interested uh and uh and and work with it, you know, for the next round. Uh, as you can tell from these numbers uh, nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: So. So, there 'll still be plenty to do. Barry, you 've been pretty quiet.\ngrad c: Just listening.\nprofessor d: Well I figured that, but That what what what were you involved in in this primarily?\ngrad c: Um, helping out uh, preparing Well, they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh, uh w doing some work on the on the preparing all all the data for them to to um, train and to test on. Um Yeah. Right now, I 'm I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan's class.\nprofessor d: Ah!\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: I see. Right. What's what's that?\ngrad c: Um, I 'm trying to um So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this this multi - band um, belief - net structure. This guy did \nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: uh basically it was two H M Ms with with a with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\ngrad c: And so I wanna try try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band. I wanna try having the arrows go both ways. And um, I 'm just gonna see if if that that better models um, uh asynchrony in any way or um  Yeah.\nprofessor d: Oh! OK. Well, that sounds interesting.\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. Alright. Anything to you wanted to No. OK. Silent partner in the in the meeting. Oh, we got a laugh out of him, that's good. OK, everyone h must contribute to the our our sound sound files here. OK, so speaking of which, if we don't have anything else that we need You happy with where we are?\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: Know know wher know where we 're going? Uh \nphd a: I think so, yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah, yeah. You you happy?\nphd b: \nprofessor d: You 're happy. OK everyone should be happy. OK. You don't have to be happy. You 're almost done. Yeah, yeah. OK.\ngrad e: Al - actually I should mention So if  um, about the Linux machine \" Swede. \"\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad e: So it looks like the um, neural net tools are installed there.\nphd a: Mmm.\ngrad e: And um Dan Ellis I believe knows something about using that machine so\nphd a: Mmm.\ngrad e: If people are interested in in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that.\nphd a: Yeah, but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines. Well. we could start computing another huge table but yeah, we \nprofessor d: Well. Yeah, I think we want a different table, at least\nphd a: Yeah, sure.\nprofessor d: Right? I mean there's there's some different things that we 're trying to get at now.\nphd a: But \nprofessor d: But \nphd a: Yeah. Mmm.\nprofessor d: So. Yeah, as far as you can tell, you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh, for training and so on? Yeah.\nphd a: Ah yeah. I think so. Well, more is always better, but mmm, I don't think we have to train a lot of networks, now that we know We just select what works fine\nprofessor d: OK. OK.\nphd a: and try to improve this\nphd b: Yeah. to work\nprofessor d: And we 're OK on And we 're OK on disk?\nphd a: and It's OK, yeah. Well sometimes we have some problems.\nphd b: Some problems with the \nprofessor d: But they 're correctable, uh problems.\nphd a: Yeah, restarting the script basically\nphd b: You know.\nphd a: and \nprofessor d: Yes. Yeah, I 'm familiar with that one, OK. Alright, so uh, since uh, we didn't ha get a channel on for you, you don't have to read any digits but the rest of us will. Uh, is it on? Well. We didn't uh I think I won't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do, pretty easily. OK, thanks. OK, so we 'll uh I 'll start off the uh um connect the \nphd a: My battery is low.\nprofessor d: Well, let's hope it works. Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're OK.\nphd b: batteries?\ngrad c: Yeah, your battery's going down too.\nprofessor d: Transcript uh two \ngrad c: Carmen's battery is d going down too.\nprofessor d: Oh, OK. Yeah. Why don't you go next then. OK. Guess we 're done. OK, uh so. Just finished digits. Yeah, so. Uh Well, it's good.

And there's a lot of different meetings at UW uh I mean really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus,\ngrad g: Right.\nprofessor e: so.\nphd a: Is the uh, notion of recording any of Chuck's meetings dead in the water, or is that still a possibility?\nprofessor e: Uh, they seem to have some problems with it. We can we can talk about that later. Um, but, again, Jerry is Jerry's open So I mean, we have two speech meetings, one uh network meeting, uh Jerry was open to it but I I s One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation, there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work, we probably can't do it every week. You know? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel uh are gonna feel a little bit constrained. Now, it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time. And the then so then they can just really sort of try to put the mikes on and then just charge in and \ngrad g: Yep.\nphd c: What if we give people you know, we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something?\npostdoc b: Well, you know, I I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise.\nphd c: OK.\npostdoc b: But I had another question, which is um, you know, in principle, w um, I know that you don't want artificial topics,\nphd c: Alright, alright, alright.\npostdoc b: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial. I mean, we could political discussions, or or something or other,\nphd c: No, definitely.\npostdoc b: and i you know, people who are Because, you know, there's also this constraint. We d it's like, you know, the the uh goldibears goldi goldilocks, it's like you don't want meetings that are too large, but you don't want meetings that are too small. And um a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool, in the positive sense of the word.\nphd a: Well, even I mean, coming down from campus is sort of a big thing, but what about\npostdoc b: We could pay subjects.\nphd a: or what about people in the in the building?\nphd c: Yeah, I was thinking, there's all these other peo\nphd a: I mean, there's the State of California downstairs, and \nphd c: Yeah. I mean \ngrad g: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public.\npostdoc b: Yeah.\nphd a: Oh.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: So I I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition\nphd c: Alright, well.\ngrad g: and, they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \", but then I got email from them that said \" no, we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings. \" So, I think it's gonna be a problem to get people regularly.\nphd a: What about Joachim, maybe he can \nprofessor e: But but we c But I think, you know, we get some scattered things from this and that. And I I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television, but \nphd a: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones.\nphd c: Well, and they 're already they 're these things are already recorded,\ngrad g: Yep.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: we don't have to ask them to even and I 'm not sure wh how they record it, but they must record from individual \nprofessor e: n Well No, I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded. I 'm talking about new ones\nphd c: Why why not?\nprofessor e: because because because we would be asking them to do something different.\nphd c: Well, we can find out. I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in in LDC getting data, uh, and \nprofessor e: Right, that's the found data idea.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel, let's say, of a distant mike.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: And u I think routinely they would not do this. So, since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff, I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere\nphd c: Right. Great. OK. \nprofessor e: and uh But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to the I might be able to talk them into it.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Um. We 're getting towards the end of our disk space, so we should think about trying to wrap up here.\nphd c: That's a good way to end a meeting.\nprofessor e: OK. Well I don't why don't we why d u why don't we uh uh turn them turn\ngrad g: OK, leave leave them on for a moment until I turn this off, cuz that's when it crashed last time.\npostdoc b: Oh. That's good to know.\nprofessor e: Turning off the microphone made it crash.

Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: But I I know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk. And so I think what he's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system, rather than on new disk.\nphd d: Mmm. Mmm.\ngrad a: So. Which \nprofessor b: Well. So. But this this is a very specific question for me. Basically, we can easily get one to four disks, I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it, it's no big deal. Uh, but the question is where they go, and I don't think we can solve that here, you just have to ask him.\nphd d: Maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there.\ngrad a: Yeah really.\nprofessor b: Attach to \ngrad a: Popcorn.\nprofessor b: Yeah?\nphd d: To the machine that collects the data.

{"fname": "academic_dev_52", "dialogue": "professor a: Oh. You 're playing?\nphd b: I um Huh?\nprofessor a: You 're playing?\nphd b: Yes, I 'm playing. Um so I wanted to do this experiment to see um uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things. And so I had this um I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment, this matrix where I would take the um the original um the original system. So there's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again. So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end.\nprofessor a: What which test set was this?\nphd b: This is that I looked at?\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that um that uh Stephane had. So um I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to uh to improve it. So. One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and just looked at, you know, the number of phones in each one of the digits. Um you know, sort of the canonical way of setting up a an HMM system is that you use um three states per phone and um so then the the total number of states for a word would just be, you know, the number of phones times three. And so when I did that for the Italian digits, I got a number of states, ranging on the low end from nine to the high end, eighteen. Um. Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there's an initial null and a final null so when they use uh models that have eighteen states, there 're really sixteen states. They 've got those initial and final null states. And so um their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits, the four and five which um, according to my, you know, sort of off the cuff calculation, should have eighteen states each.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And so they had sixteen. So that's pretty close. Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter. So the majority of them wanna have nine states. And so theirs are s sort of twice as long. So my guess uh And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the well - matched case, and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best. So my guess about what's happening is that you know, if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have, you know, half as much training data for those models. Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states, uh you 've got you know, you 've got the same number of Gaussians, you 've gotta train in each case,\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: but for the shorter words, you know, the total number of frames is actually half as many.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So it could be that, you know, for the short words there's because you have so many states, you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians. So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from.\nprofessor a: Yeah, I mean, it's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word,\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: but.\nphd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll, the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um how these models were coming out, you know, what w when we train up uh th you know, the model for \" one \", which wants to have nine states, you know, what is the uh what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops, look like in in those models? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what's happening, you know, how these models are training up,\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd b: you know, the long ones versus the short ones. I d I did quickly, I did the silence model and and um that's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model's the one that's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits.\nprofessor a: Wow. Lots of silence.\nphd b: Yeah, yeah. And so the S P model, which is what they put in between digits, I I haven't calculated that for that one yet, but um. So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit, SP, digit, SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end. And so.\nprofessor a: Are the SP's optional? I mean skip them?\nphd b: I have to look at that, but I 'm not sure that they are. Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So if it's not optional, you know, it's it's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nprofessor a: I see.\nphd b: and it's tied to the center state of the silence model so it's not its own um It doesn't require its own training data,\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: it just shares that state.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So it, I mean, it's pretty good the way that they have it set up, but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more. I 'm curious about looking at, you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case, and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models, you know, what what's happening.\nprofessor a: Yeah, I mean, I think that uh, as much as you can, it's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Not do anything that's really finely tuned, but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with?\nphd b: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: And uh\nphd b: And Hynek, when I wa told him about this, he had an interesting point, and that was th um the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state. So they 're fairly, you know, hefty models. And Hynek was saying that well, probably in a real application, you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated. So in fact what we may want are simpler models.\nprofessor a: Could be.\nphd b: And compare how they perform to that. But you know, it depends on what the actual application is and it's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have.\nprofessor a: Right. And that, I mean, at the moment that's not the limitation, so.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: I mean, I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from. You know, so.\nphd b: Yeah. Right.\nprofessor a: Uh that's another parameter, right? that that maybe, you know, uh you really want three or nine or \nphd b: Yeah, yeah. Well one thing I mean, if I if if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians.\nprofessor a: Right.\nphd b: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system.\nprofessor a: Yeah. Yeah. But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor a: how much better can you make it? And um since they 're only simple things there's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: um so\nphd b: Right.

They came in the other day.\ngrad a: They came in but they 're not set up yet.\nprofessor b: Oh.\ngrad a: And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room, they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines. And if we just need un - backed - up space, we could just hang disks off them.\nphd f: Well, is there Why not just hang them off of Abbott, is there a \ngrad a: Because there's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd f: Ah.\nprofessor b: Weren't we gonna get \nphd f: Ah, I see.\nprofessor b: Well, maybe it should get another rack.\nphd d: But you still need to store the disks somehow.\ngrad a: Well, but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays.\nphd d: So \ngrad a: Just put them in.\nphd f: You can put two \nphd d: Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the \ngrad a: Sure.\nphd c: Internal. Yeah.\ngrad a: Yeah. Cuz the SUN uh, these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives.\nphd d: Oh.\ngrad a: So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in.\nphd d: Mmm.\nprofessor b: But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it, uh, a second disk rack or something.\nphd d: Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh, file server.\ngrad a: Well, I mean there are lots of long term solutions. What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting?\nphd c: Yep.\nphd d: I see Oh, I see.\nprofessor b: Well, for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten, mightn't you? Uh, you know Dave Johnson is gone for, like, ten days,\ngrad a: Oh, I didn't know he had left already.\nprofessor b: Uh, well, tonight.\ngrad a: Oh, oh well.\nphd d: You mean he won't set up the mmm.\nprofessor b: I don't know.\ngrad e: How much space do you need for these?\nprofessor b: I don't know what his schedule is.\ngrad a: You we need about a gig per meeting.\nprofessor b: I 'm just saying he's gone.\nphd c: Yep.\nphd f: I I thi\ngrad e: I have um I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer.\ngrad a: Alright! What's your computer's name?\ngrad e: So Uh, Samosa.\nprofessor b: You had an eighteen gigabyte drive.\ngrad e: Yeah, I had. Well it's about I think there's about twelve gig left.\ngrad a: So it And you have an X drives installed? OK.\ngrad e: Yeah. So, I didn't realize it was so critical.\ngrad a: And you 're o you 're offering?\ngrad e: I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything.\ngrad a: OK.\ngrad e: Um not that I can't do anything, I jus\nphd f: I I jus I just gave Thilo some about ten gigs, the last ten gigs of space that there was on on uh Abbott.

It's XH and D \ngrad e: I think it's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there,\nphd d: The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused.\ngrad e: three or four meetings.\nphd d: OK.\ngrad a: Great.\ngrad e: So.\ngrad a: OK, so that will get us through the next couple days.\nprofessor b: We need We need another gigaquad.\ngrad a: Yep. At least.\nprofessor b: There should I d There should just be a b I should have a button.\ngrad a: The \" more disk space \" button?\nprofessor b: Just press Press each meeting saying \" we need more disk space \" \" this week \".\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor b: Skip the rest of the conversation.\nphd f: Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings.\nprofessor b: And And how much does each meeting take?\nphd f: And it's about a gig uncompressed.\nphd c: It's It's a little bit more as I usually don't do not uncompress the all of the PZM and the PDA things.\nphd f: Is a little more?\nphd c: So.\nphd f: Right, yeah so if you uncompressed everything it's even more.\nphd c: It's Yeah. One point five or something.\nphd f: U Uh compressed how much are they? Like \ngrad a: Half a gig. For all of them.\nphd f: About half?\nphd c: Yeah. Yeah. Yep.\nphd f: So we 're definitely are storing you know, all of those. So there's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far?\nprofessor b: So - so So maybe there's a hundred gig or something. Or I mean. Cuz we we have the uncompressed around also.\nphd f: Mm - hmm. Right.\nprofessor b: So it's like \nphd c: Yeah.\nphd f: Right. Well we We haven't uncompressed all the meetings, but \ngrad a: I would like to.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Well I mean it's the they really are cheap. I mean it's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them,\ngrad a: Yep.\nphd f: Right.\nprofessor b: but But uh, we could You know, if you want to get four disks, get four disks. I mean it's it's small I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars.\nphd f: Yeah. Well I sent that message out to, I guess, you and Dave asking for if we could get some disk.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd f: I s I sent this out a a day ago\ngrad a: And put it where?\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd f: but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works. I mean does he just go out and get them and if it's OK, and \ngrad a: Yep.\nphd f: So I was assuming he was gonna take over that. But he's probably too busy given that he's leaving.\nprofessor b: Yeah, I think you need a direct conversation with him. And just say an - e just ask him that, you know, wha what should you do. And in my answer back was \" are you sure you just want one? \" So I mean I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure \" well, here's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months \".\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad a: Wa - a I know what they want. The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine. So they don't want to stack up external drives.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad a: Um  And then they want everything else in the machine room.\nprofessor b: Right.\ngrad a: So the question is where are you gonna hang them?\nphd f: Mm - hmm. I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room.\ngrad a: Right.\nphd f: So.\nprofessor b: Right. So this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave,\nphd d: Th - The \nphd f: I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now.\nprofessor b: cuz it \nphd d: One Mmm.\ngrad a: Yep.\nphd d: One One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is\nphd f: So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff.\nphd d: I bet there are still some old, uh, like, nine gig disks, uh, around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and and you know recover the space.\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor b: Yeah. No. I think Dave Dave knows all these things, of course. An - and so, he always has a a lot of plans of things that he's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time.\nphd d: Right. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: But I I know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk. And so I think what he's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system, rather than on new disk.\nphd d: Mmm. Mmm.\ngrad a: So. Which \nprofessor b: Well. So. But this this is a very specific question for me. Basically, we can easily get one to four disks, I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it, it's no big deal. Uh, but the question is where they go, and I don't think we can solve that here, you just have to ask him.\nphd d: Maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there.\ngrad a: Yeah really.\nprofessor b: Attach to \ngrad a: Popcorn.\nprofessor b: Yeah?\nphd d: To the machine that collects the data. So then you could, at least temporarily, store stuff there.\ngrad a: Yeah, it's just It's not on the net, so it's a little awkward\nphd d: The only \nphd f: Hmm.\nphd d: What do you mean it's not on the net?\ngrad a: It's not \nphd c: It's not bad.\ngrad a: It's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S\nphd d: Oh because it's because it's an ACIRI machine?\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd d: Oh, oh oh.\ngrad a: And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net, but Who knows when that will happen?\nphd d: But that can't be that hard.\nphd f: That might be a good short term solution, though.\nphd d: I mean \ngrad a: No, the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers.\nphd d: Oh,\ngrad a: So, they actually have to run a wire somewhere.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah, e again, you know, any one of these things is certainly not a big deal. If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's it's jus every ever everybody everybody has a has \ngrad a: But Dave has to do all of them.\nprofessor b: Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing. But at any rate I think that there's a there's a longer term thing and there's immediate need and I think we need a a conversation with Uh, maybe maybe after after tea or something you and I can go down and and talk to him about it Just say \" wha you know, what should we do right now? \"\nphd f: How long is David gonna be gone?\nprofessor b: Uh, eleven days or something?\ngrad a: Oh my!\nprofessor b: Yeah basically tomorrow and all of the week after.\ngrad a: And that's all I have.\nprofessor b: Um Let's see. The only oth thing other thing I was gonna add was that um uh, I talked briefly to Mari and uh we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next. And I I I wanted to make it, um after the next one of these meetings, so something that we wanna do next meeting is is uh to put together um, a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it, um, that we 've done.

So just a week from tomorrow?\nprofessor b: Um, that would\ngrad a: OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, we can This So that's an \nphd d: Is this gotta be in the morning?\nprofessor b: Um \nphd d: Or Because you know I Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two. So if it could be before that would be be\nprofessor b: No, no but I I I don't need other folks for the meeting. I can do it. A A All I 'm saying is that on \nphd d: Oh, OK, alright. Oh I 'm sorry, I misunderstood.\nprofessor b: Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting if I wa something I I I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her.", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion on storage disks and computer connections", "zh_query": "总结关于磁盘存储器和计算机连接件的讨论", "fr_query": "Résumer la discussion sur les disques de stockage et les connexions informatiques", "ukr_query": "Підведіть підсумки обговорення дисків зберігання та з'єднань з комп'ютером", "en_summary": "The participants learned that the storage disks had eventually arrived.

Um. The we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system, and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one, am Smarticus. \" It actually says, \" Roemisch einz, am Smarticus, \"\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: which means it's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: So uh,\nprofessor c: It doesn't know \" I \".\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: Um, the uh\ngrad b: Oh, Am Spartacus. \"\ngrad d: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it's saying.\nphd a: Right.\ngrad b: Verstehe.

And, um, it's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach. So I 'm I 'm I 'm going backwards now, so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this uh, make these sounds, and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said, and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better, presumably. Then, just with text to speech.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And, uh, Johno learned how to write XML tags. Uh, and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some some sentences.

{"fname": "academic_dev_41", "dialogue": "professor d: OK.\nphd a: Mike. Mike - one?\nphd b: Ah.\nprofessor d: We 're on? Yes, please. I mean, we 're testing noise robustness but let's not get silly. OK, so, uh, you 've got some, uh, Xerox things to pass out?\nphd a: Yeah,\nprofessor d: That are \nphd a: um.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah, I 'm sorry for the table, but as it grows in size, uh, it.\nprofessor d: Uh, so for th the last column we use our imagination. OK.\nphd b: Ah, yeah.\nprofessor d: Ah.\nphd a: Uh, yeah.\nphd b: Uh, do you want @ @.\nprofessor d: This one's nice, though. This has nice big font.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad c: Let's see. Yeah. Chop!\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: So\nprofessor d: When you get older you have these different perspectives. I mean, lowering the word hour rate is fine, but having big font!\nphd a: Next time we will put colors or something.\nprofessor d: That's what's \nphd a: Uh.\nprofessor d: Yeah. It's mostly big font. OK.\nphd a: OK, s so there is kind of summary of what has been done \nprofessor d: Uh Go ahead.\nphd a: It's this. Summary of experiments since, well, since last week\nprofessor d: Oh. OK.\nphd a: and also since the we 've started to run work on this. Um. So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also, because the column was not completely \nprofessor d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. \nphd a: well, it's still not completely filled,\nprofessor d: \nphd a: but we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and finally, hhh, um ehhh PL - uh delta seems very important. Uh I don't know. If you take um, let's say, anyway Aurora - two - B, so, the next t the second, uh, part of the table,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: uh when we use the large training set using French, Spanish, and English, you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta.\nprofessor d: a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being, uh, the baseline performance,\nphd a: Yeah, on the baseline, yeah. So \nprofessor d: but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK?\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah. So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much uh uh much smaller\nprofessor d: Yes.\nphd a: um \ngrad c: It's out of the way.\nphd a: But, actually, um, for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages. And Mmm, Yeah. And f also for Italian, actually. If you take the second set of experiment for Italian, so, the mismatched condition,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: um when we use the training on TIMIT so, it's multi - English, we have a ninety - one number,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: and training with other languages is a little bit worse.\nprofessor d: Um Oh, I see. Down near the bottom of this sheet.\nphd a: So,\nprofessor d: Uh,  yes.\nphd a: yeah.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: And, yeah, and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta. If y if I take the training s the large training set, it's we have one hundred and seventy - two,\nprofessor d: Yes.\nphd a: and one hundred and four when we use delta.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh. Even if the contexts used is quite the same,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: because without delta we use seventeenths seventeen frames. Uh. Yeah, um, so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments, uh, that we did not have last week. Uh, so this is training the net on French only, or on English only, and testing on Italian.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on, uh TI - digits.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And, fff um, yeah. What we see is that these nets are not as good, except for the multi - English, which is always one of the best. Yeah, then we started to work on a large dat database containing, uh, sentences from the French, from the Spanish, from the TIMIT, from SPINE, uh from uh English digits, and from Italian digits. So this is the another line another set of lines in the table. Uh, @ @ with SPINE\nprofessor d: Ah, yes. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: and uh, actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data, uh, so we have to to redo the uh the experiment training the net with, uh PLP, but with delta. But\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: um this this net performed quite well. Well, it's it's better than the net using French, Spanish, and English only. Uh. So, uh, yeah. We have also started feature combination experiments. Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together. And this is The results are on the other document. Uh, we can discuss this after, perhaps well, just, @ @. Yeah, so basically there are four four kind of systems. The first one, yeah, is combining, um, two feature streams, uh using and each feature stream has its own MPL. So it's the kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first. The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal. The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs. And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs. Um, yeah. Mmm. You know you can you can comment these results,\nphd b: Yes, I can s I would like to say that, for example, um, mmm, if we doesn't use the delta - delta, uh we have an improve when we use s some combination. But when\nphd a: Yeah, we ju just to be clear, the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy.\nphd b: w Yeah, this Yeah, this number recognition acc\nphd a: So it's not the Again we switch to another \nphd b: Yes, and the baseline the baseline have i is eighty - two.\nprofessor d: Baseline is eighty - two.\nphd b: Yeah\nphd a: So it's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this.\nprofessor d: Uh, this is Italian mismatched.\nphd a: Um.\nphd b: Yeah, by the moment.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd b: And first in the experiment - one I I do I I use different MLP,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better. Um. for the ne rest of experiment I use multi - English, only multi - English. And I try to combine different type of feature, but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy.\nphd a: Yeah, eh, actually, if w we look at the table, the huge table, um, we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So, um uh, well, I don't think this is a bug but this this is something in probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly. Perhaps the fact that the the there's no low - pass filter, well, or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian, or, well, something simple like that. But that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And as Carmen said, if we combine the two, we have the result, basically, of PLP.\nprofessor d: I Um, the uh, baseline system when you said the baseline system was uh, uh eighty - two percent, that was trained on what and tested on what? That was, uh Italian mismatched d uh, uh, digits, uh, is the testing,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: and the training is Italian digits?\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and and, uh microphone and so forth,\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: right? So, um did we have So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is is the uh Italian digits?\nphd b: The train the training of the HTK?\nprofessor d: The \nphd b: Yes. Ah yes!\nprofessor d: Yes.\nphd b: This h Yes. Th - Yes.\nprofessor d: Yes. Training of the net,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: yeah. So, um So what that says is that in a matched condition, we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP. Now w would do we have a number, I suppose for the matched I I don't mean matched, but uh use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only?\nphd b: Uh yes?\nphd a: Uh yeah, so this is basically this is in the table. Uh so the number is fifty - two,\nphd b: Another table.\nphd a: uh \nprofessor d: Fifty - two percent.\nphd a: Fift - So No, it's it's the \nphd b: No.\nprofessor d: No, fifty - two percent of eighty - two?\nphd a: Of of of uh eighteen \nphd b: Eighty.\nphd a: of eighteen.\nphd b: Eighty.\nphd a: So it's it's error rate, basically.\nphd b: It's plus six.\nphd a: It's er error rate ratio. So \nprofessor d: Oh this is accuracy! \nphd a: Uh, so we have nine nine let's say ninety percent.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Oy! OK. Ninety.\nphd a: Yeah. Um which is uh what we have also if use PLP and MSG together,\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: eighty - nine point seven.\nprofessor d: OK, so even just PLP, uh, it is not, in the matched condition Um I wonder if it's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra, or whether it's that the net half, for some reason, is not helping.\nphd a: Uh. P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same same results.\nprofessor d: Same result pretty much?\nphd a: Well, we have these results. I don't know. It's not Do you have this result with PLP alone, j fee feeding HTK?\nprofessor d: So, s\nphd a: That That's what you mean?\nphd b: Yeah,\nphd a: Just PLP at the input of HTK.\nphd b: yeah yeah yeah yeah, at the first and the Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. So, PLP \nprofessor d: Eighty - eight point six.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um, so adding MSG\nphd a: Um \nprofessor d: um Well, but that's yeah, that's without the neural net,\nphd a: Yeah, that's without the neural net\nprofessor d: right?\nphd a: and that's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization.\nprofessor d: But she had said eighty - two.\nphd a: This is the w well, but this is without on - line normalization.\nprofessor d: Right? Oh, this the eighty - two.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: \nphd a: Eighty - two is the it's the Aurora baseline, so MFCC. Then we can use well, OGI, they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization\nprofessor d: Oh, I 'm sorry, I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy.\nphd a: Yeah, sorry. Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. Alright.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Alright. So this is I was thinking all this was worse. OK so this is all better\nphd b: Yes, better.\nprofessor d: because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. I 'm I 'm all better now. OK, go ahead.\nphd a: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh, when we apply a neural network, is the same. We j jump to ninety percent.\nphd b: Nnn, we don't know exactly.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: And And um whatever the normalization, actually. If we use n neural network, even if the features are not correctly normalized, we jump to ninety percent. So \nprofessor d: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety, or something.\nphd a: Well, ninety No, I I mean ninety It's around eighty - nine, ninety, eighty - eight.\nprofessor d: Eighty - nine.\nphd a: Well, there are minor minor differences.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And then adding the MSG does nothing, basically.\nphd a: No.\nprofessor d: Yeah. OK.\nphd a: Uh For Italian, yeah.\nprofessor d: For this case, right?\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor d: Alright. So, um So actually, the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG, if you uh does not help in that case.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Um \nphd a: But w Yeah.\nprofessor d: The other ones, we 'd have to look at it, but And the multi - English, does uh So if we think of this in error rates, we start off with, uh eighteen percent error rate, roughly.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Um and we uh almost, uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net.\nphd a: Yeah\nprofessor d: And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things.\nphd a: No.\nprofessor d: And we cut off, I guess about twenty - five percent of the error. Uh no, not quite that, is it. Uh, two point six out of eighteen. About, um sixteen percent or something of the error, um, if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Not matching condition, but uh, the uh, Italian training.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd b: We select these these these tasks because it's the more difficult.\nprofessor d: Yes, good. OK? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching, uh, data for the uh for the new for the other languages and so forth. Um, one qu thing is that, uh I think I asked you this before, but I wanna double check. When you say \" ME \" in these other tests, that's the multi - English,\nphd a: That's it's a part it's \nprofessor d: but it is not all of the multi - English, right? It is some piece of part of it.\nphd a: Or, one million frames.\nprofessor d: And the multi - English is how much?\nphd b: You have here the information.\nphd a: It's one million and a half. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Oh, so you used almost all You used two thirds of it,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: you think. So, it it's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: I wonder why Yeah. Uh.\ngrad c: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled,\nphd a: Yeah, it's \nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad c: the French and the Spanish.\nphd b: The Spanish. Maybe for that.\nprofessor d: Hmm.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: It's still OK. Alright, go ahead. And then then \nphd b: Um. Mmm, with the experiment type - two, I first I tried to to combine, nnn, some feature from the MLP and other feature another feature.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And we s we can first the feature are without delta and delta - delta, and we can see that in the situation, uh, the MSG - three, the same help nothing.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta PLP delta and delta - delta. And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta. And we have a l little bit less result than the the the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Maybe if when we have the new the new neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta, maybe the final result must be better. I don't know.\nphd a: Actually, just to be some more \nphd b: Uh \nphd a: Do This number, this eighty - seven point one number, has to be compared with the\nprofessor d: Yes, yeah, I mean it can't be compared with the other\nphd a: Which number?\nprofessor d: cuz this is, uh with multi - English, uh, training.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box, which is that, uh the eighty - four point six.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Right?\nphd a: Uh.\nprofessor d: So \nphd a: Yeah, but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: and straight features with delta - delta. And straight features with delta - delta gives you what's on the first sheet.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Not t not\nphd a: It's eight eighty - eight point six.\nprofessor d: tr No. No. No.\nphd b: Yes.\nprofessor d: Not trained with multi - English.\nphd a: Uh, yeah, but th this is the second configuration.\nphd b: No, but they they feature @ @ without \nphd a: So we use feature out uh, net outputs together with features. So yeah, this is not perhaps not clear here but in this table, the first column is for MLP and the second for the features.\nprofessor d: Eh. Oh, I see. Ah. So you 're saying w so asking the question, \" What what has adding the MLP done to improve over the,\nphd a: So, just Yeah so, actually it it it decreased the the accuracy.\nprofessor d: uh \nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yes.\nphd a: Because we have eighty - eight point six.\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\nphd a: And even the MLP alone What gives the MLP alone? Multi - English PLP. Oh no, it gives eighty - three point six. So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six,\nphd b: But \nphd a: that gives eighty - seven point one.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm. Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh, OK, eighty - three point six and eighty eighty - eight point six.\nphd a: Eighty - three point six. Eighty \nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: Is th is that right? Yeah?\nphd b: Yeah. But I don't know but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP delta and delta - delta, maybe tha this can help.\nphd a: Perhaps, yeah.\nprofessor d: Well, that's that's one thing, but see the other thing is that, um, I mean it's good to take the difficult case, but let's let's consider what that means. What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that I mean my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this, as motivation. When we train on data that is in one sense or another, similar to the testing data, then we get a win by having discriminant training.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: When we train on something that's quite different, we have a potential to have some problems.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: And, um, if we get something that helps us when it's somewhat similar, and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it's quite different, that's maybe not so bad.\nphd a: Yeah. Mmm.\nprofessor d: So the question is, if you took the same combination, and you tried it out on, uh on say digits,\nphd a: On TI - digits? OK.\nprofessor d: you know, d Was that experiment done?\nphd a: No, not yet.\nprofessor d: Yeah, OK. Uh, then does that, eh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth, does it does it then look much better?\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh of tests? So, an anyway. OK, go ahead.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: And, with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven, uh, d I have found more or less the same result.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So, it's slightly better,\nphd b: Little bit better?\nphd a: yeah.\nprofessor d: Slightly better.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Slightly bet better. Yes, is better.\nprofessor d: And and you know again maybe if you use the, uh, delta there, uh, you would bring it up to where it was, uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case.\nphd b: Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Oh, yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. Well, so perhaps let's let's jump at the last experiment.\nphd b: Oh, yeah.\nprofessor d: So.\nphd a: It's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output.\nphd b: i\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: It's again better. So it's eighty - nine point point one.\nphd b: Yeah,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and we have only forty forty feature\nphd a: So.\nphd b: because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah. And then w with the first configuration, I f I am found that work, uh, doesn't work \nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd b: uh, well, work, but is better, the second configuration. Because I for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta, here I have eighty - five point three accuracy, and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one.\nprofessor d: Um, by the way, there is a another, uh, suggestion that would apply, uh, to the second configuration, um, which, uh, was made, uh, by, uh, Hari. And that was that, um, if you have uh feed two streams into HTK, um, and you, uh, change the, uh variances if you scale the variances associated with, uh these streams um, you can effectively scale the streams. Right? So, um, you know, without changing the scripts for HTK, which is the rule here, uh, you can still change the variances\nphd a: Mm - hmm. \nprofessor d: which would effectively change the scale of these these, uh, two streams that come in.\nphd a: Uh, yeah.\nprofessor d: And, um, so, um, if you do that, for instance it may be the case that, um, the MLP should not be considered as strongly, for instance.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: And, um, so this is just setting them to be, excuse me, of equal equal weight. Maybe it shouldn't be equal weight.\nphd b: Maybe.\nprofessor d: Right? You know, I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that, but but, uh, um, you know on the other hand it's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: It's not even the HTK,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: uh, uh \nphd b: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Well, I guess you have to do the HTK training also.\nphd b: so this is what we decided to do.\nprofessor d: Uh, do you? Let me think. Maybe you don't. Uh. Yeah, you have to change the No, you can just do it in as once you 've done the training \ngrad c: And then you can vary it. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah, the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could you could just scale them all.\nphd a: Scale\nprofessor d: Variances.\nphd a: Yeah. But Is it i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances, so I d Is it \nprofessor d: That's uh, exactly the point, I think, that if you change um, change what they are \nphd a: Hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: It's diagonal covariance matrices, but you say what those variances are.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: So, that you know, it's diagonal, but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna it's gonna it's gonna internally multiply it and and uh, uh, i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities, and so it's it's gonna it's it's going to affect the range of things if you change the change the variances of some of the features.\nphd a: Mmm. Mmm.\nphd b: do?\nprofessor d: So, i it's precisely given that model you can very simply affect, uh, the s the strength that you apply the features. That was that was, uh, Hari's suggestion.\nphd a: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: So, um \nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah. So. So it could just be that h treating them equally, tea treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do. Of course it's potentially opening a can of worms because, you know, maybe it should be a different number for for each kind of test set, or something,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: but OK.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So I guess the other thing is to take you know if one were to take, uh, you know, a couple of the most successful of these,\nphd a: Yeah, and test across everything.\nprofessor d: and uh Yeah, try all these different tests.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Alright. Uh.\nphd a: So, the next point, yeah, we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn, um, about their um, uh, articulatory stuff, um. So we 'll perhaps start something next week.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Um, discussion with Hynek, Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our our networks with their within their block diagram, uh, where to plug in the the network, uh, after the the feature, before as um a as a plugin or as a anoth another path, discussion about multi - band and TRAPS, um, actually Hynek would like to see, perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is, uh, temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band. And he would like to replace these by a network which would, uh, make the system look like a TRAP. Well, basically, it would be a TRAP system. Basically, this is a TRAP system kind of TRAP system, I mean, but where the neural network are replaced by LDA. Hmm. Um, yeah, and about multi - band, uh, I started multi - band MLP trainings, um mmh Actually, I w I w hhh prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium. So I take exactly the same configurations, seven bands with nine frames of context, and we just train on TIMIT, and on the large database, so, with SPINE and everything. And, mmm, I 'm starting to train also, networks with larger contexts. So, this would would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands, and but with a lot of context also. So Um Yeah, we still have to work on Finnish, um, basically, to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages. For the moment it's the TIMIT network, and perhaps the network trained on everything. So. Now we can test these two networks on with with delta and large networks. Well, test them also on Finnish\nphd b: Mmm.\nphd a: and see which one is the the the best. Uh, well, the next part of the document is, well, basically, a kind of summary of what everything that has been done. So. We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one, two, three, four, uh, three, four, five, six, seven ten on ten different databases.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh, the number of frames is bad also, so we have one million and a half for some, three million for other, and six million for the last one. Uh, yeah! As we mentioned, TIMIT is the only that's hand - labeled, and perhaps this is what makes the difference. Um. Yeah, the other are just Viterbi - aligned. So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things. First, um with respect to the on - line normalization, there are that use bad on - line normalization, and other good on - line normalization. Um. With respect to the features, with respect to the use of delta or no, uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets. Uh, but of course we don't have all the combination of these different parameters Um. s What's this? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand.\nprofessor d: Ugh! I was impressed boy, two thousand.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Ah, yes.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd b: I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the \nprofessor d: Alright, now I 'm just slightly impressed, OK.\nphd a: Um. Yeah, basically the observation is what we discussed already. The MSG problem, um, the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate. but when the M - MLP is trained on the um is not trained on the target task, it increased the error rate compared to using straight features. Except if the features are bad uh, actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized. In this case the tandem is still better even if it's trained on not on the target digits.\nprofessor d: Yeah. So it sounds like yeah, the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: But if you can do good normalization it's it's uh OK.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh, so the fourth point is, yeah, the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better the best network.\nprofessor d: So So - Let me bef before you go on to the possible issues.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: So, on the MSG uh problem um, I think that in in the um, in the short time solution um, that is, um, trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: uh, much as I said with JRASTA, even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: I think it's kind of in category that it's, it it may be complicated.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And uh it might be if someone's interested in it, uh, certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term, once we get out of this particular rush uh for results.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: But in the short term, unless you have some some s strong idea of what's wrong,\nphd a: I don't know at all but I 've perhaps I have the feeling that it's something that's quite quite simple or just like nnn, no high - pass filter\nprofessor d: Yeah, probably.\nphd a: or Mmm. Yeah. My But I don't know.\nprofessor d: There's supposed to well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though, right?\nphd a: It's There is, yeah, an AGC - kind of AGC. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah, but also there's an on - line norm besides the AGC, there's an on - line normalization that's supposed to be uh, yeah,\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: taking out means and variances and so forth. So.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design,\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor d: so it's \nphd a: Yeah, but Yeah. But this was the bad on - line normalization. Actually. Uh. Are your results are still with the bad the bad \nphd b: Maybe, may No? With the better \nphd a: With the O - OLN - two?\nphd b: No?\nphd a: Ah yeah, you have you have OLN - two,\nphd b: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah! With \" two \", with \" on - line - two \".\nphd a: yeah.\nphd b: Yeah, yeah,\nprofessor d: \" On - line - two \" is good.\nphd a: So it's, is the good yeah.\nphd b: yeah. Yep, it's a good.\nprofessor d: \" Two \" is good?\nphd a: And \nprofessor d: No, \" two \" is bad.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Well, actually, it's good with the ch with the good.\nprofessor d: OK. Yeah. So Yeah, I I agree. It's probably something simple uh, i if if uh someone, you know, uh, wants to play with it for a little bit. I mean, you 're gonna do what you 're gonna do\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: but but my my guess would be that it's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find.\nphd a: But Yeah. Mmm. I see, yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: And \nprofessor d: Uh. And the other the results uh, observations two and three, Um, is\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: uh Yeah, that's pretty much what we 've seen. That's that what we were concerned about is that if it's not on the target task If it's on the target task then it it it helps to have the MLP transforming it.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: If it uh if it's not on the target task, then, depending on how different it is, uh you can get uh, a reduction in performance.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: And the question is now how to how to get one and not the other? Or how to how to ameliorate the the problems.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: Um, because it it certainly does is nice to have in there, when it when there is something like the training data.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. Um. Yeah. So, the the reason Yeah, the reason is that the perhaps the target the the task dependency the language dependency, and the noise dependency \nprofessor d: So that's what you say th there. I see.\nphd a: Well, the e e But this is still not clear because, um, I I I don't think we have enough result to talk about the the language dependency. Well, the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference, the fact that it's it's hand - labeled.\nprofessor d: Hey! Um, just you can just sit here. Uh, I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones but it's uh Just uh, have a seat. Um. s Summary of the first uh, uh forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and works, and some stuff doesn't OK,\nphd a: We still have uh this One of these perhaps?\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. \nprofessor d: Yeah, I guess we can do a little better than that but I think if you if you start off with the other one, actually, that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the associated results.\nphd b: Um.\nprofessor d: OK. So you 're saying that um, um, although from what we see, yes there's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency. That is, uh, when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different, we don't do as well as in the target thing. But you 're saying that uh, it is Although that general thing is observable so far, there's something you 're not completely convinced about. And and what is that? I mean, you say \" not clear yet \". What what do you mean?\nphd a: Uh, mmm, uh, I mean, that the the fact that s Well, for for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best, which is the English net.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: But the other are slightly worse. But you have two two effects, the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that's Viterbi - aligned instead of hand hand - labeled.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: So. Um. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Do you think the alignments are bad? I mean, have you looked at the alignments at all? What the Viterbi alignment's doing?\nphd a: Mmm. I don't I don't know. Did - did you look at the Spanish alignments Carmen?\nphd b: Mmm, no.\nprofessor d: Might be interesting to look at it. Because, I mean, that is just looking but um, um It's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment. It depends how good the recognizer is\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: that's that the the engine is that's doing the alignment.\nphd a: Yeah. But Yeah. But, perhaps it's not really the the alignment that's bad but the just the ph phoneme string that's used for the alignment\nprofessor d: Aha!\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd b: Yeah. \nprofessor d: The pronunciation models and so forth\nphd a: I mean for We It's single pronunciation, uh \nprofessor d: Aha.\nphd a: French French s uh, phoneme strings were corrected manually\nprofessor d: I see.\nphd a: so we asked people to listen to the um the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them. But still, there there might be errors just in the in in the ph string of phonemes. Mmm. Um. Yeah, so this is not really the Viterbi alignment, in fact, yeah. Um, the third The third uh issue is the noise dependency perhaps but, well, this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and \nprofessor d: I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth. So it And that has other noise.\nphd a: Yeah. So Yeah. But Yeah. Results are only coming for for this net. Mmm.\nprofessor d: OK, yeah, just don't just need more more results there with that @ @.\nphd a: Yeah. Um. So. Uh, from these results we have some questions with answers. What should be the network input? Um, PLP work as well as MFCC, I mean. Um. But it seems impor important to use the delta. Uh, with respect to the network size, there's one experiment that's still running and we should have the result today, comparing network with five hundred and one thousand units. So, nnn, still no answer actually.\nprofessor d: Hm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh, the training set, well, some kind of answer. We can, we can tell which training set gives the best result, but we don't know exactly why. Uh, so.\nprofessor d: Uh. Right, I mean the multi - English so far is is the best.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: \" Multi - multi - English \" just means \" TIMIT \",\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: right?\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So uh That's Yeah. So. And and when you add other things in to to broaden it, it gets worse uh typically.\nphd a: Mmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: Then uh some questions without answers.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: Uh, training set, um,\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\nphd a: uh, training targets \nprofessor d: I like that. The training set is both questions, with answers and without answers.\nphd a: It's Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor d: It's sort of, yes it's mul it's multi - uh - purpose.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: Uh, training s Right. So Yeah, the training targets actually, the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency and the noise dependency. And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency, we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And labeling s labeling seems important uh, because of TIMIT results.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh. For moment you use we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets, soft targets, and perhaps even, um use networks that doesn't do classification but just regression so uh, train to have neural networks that um, um, uh,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: does a regression and well, basically com com compute features and noit not, nnn, features without noise. I mean uh, transform the fea noisy features in other features that are not noisy. But continuous features. Not uh uh, hard targets.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh \nprofessor d: Yeah, that seems like a good thing to do, probably, not uh again a short - term sort of thing.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: I mean one of the things about that is that um it's e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being is being dependent on very dependent on the kind of noise and and so forth.\nphd a: Yeah. f But, yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh. But it's another thing to try.\nphd a: So, this is w w i wa wa this is one thing, this this could be could help could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches, like, well, the Kleinschmidt approach. So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database. I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: and So this is one approach and the other is multi - band uh, that I think is more robust to the noisy changes.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So perhaps, I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh, features - based targets could could could help.\nprofessor d: Yeah, if you i i It's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up I mean w yeah, one one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have um some reasonable database, um but then which is um copied over many times with a range of different noises,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: And uh If Cuz what you 're trying to do is come up with a a core, reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used uh, by the the uh HMM system.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: So. Yeah, OK.\nphd a: So, um, yeah. The future work is, well, try to connect to the to make to plug in the system to the OGI system. Um, there are still open questions there, where to put the MLP basically.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor d: And I guess, you know, the the the real open question, I mean, e u there's lots of open questions, but one of the core quote \" open questions \" for that is um, um, if we take the uh you know, the best ones here, maybe not just the best one, but the best few or something You want the most promising group from these other experiments. Um, how well do they do over a range of these different tests, not just the Italian?\nphd a: Mmm,\nprofessor d: Um. And y\nphd a: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor d: y Right? And then um then see, again, how We know that there's a mis there's a uh a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than, uh we 're gonna test on, but well, if you look over a range of these different tests um, how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features, uh stand up over that range?\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: That's that that seems like the the the real question. And if you know that So if you just take PLP with uh, the double - deltas. Assume that's the p the feature. look at these different ways of combining it. And uh, take let's say, just take uh multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: And just look take that case and then look over all the different things. How does that How does that compare between the \nphd a: So all the all the test sets you mean, yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: All the different test sets,\nphd a: And \nprofessor d: and for and for the couple different ways that you have of of of combining them.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um. How well do they stand up, over the \nphd a: Mmm. And perhaps doing this for cha changing the variance of the streams and so on getting different scaling \nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: That's another possibility if you have time, yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: Um. Yeah, so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the to their diagram.\nprofessor d: \nphd a: Cuz Yeah. Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn, they they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn, that discriminates,\nprofessor d: Yeah. It's a little strange\nphd a: or? Mmm?\nprofessor d: but on the other hand they did it before.\nphd a: Mmm. And and and\nprofessor d: Um the\nphd a: yeah. And because also perhaps we know that the when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help. So. I don't know.\nprofessor d: Um, the other thing, though, is that um So. Uh, we we wanna get their path running here, right? If so, we can add this other stuff.\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor d: as an additional path right?\nphd a: Yeah, the the way we want to do \nprofessor d: Cuz they 're doing LDA RASTA.\nphd a: The d What?\nprofessor d: They 're doing LDA RASTA,\nphd a: Yeah, the way we want to do it perhaps is to just to get the VAD labels and the final features.\nprofessor d: yeah?\nphd a: So they will send us the Well, provide us with the feature files,\nprofessor d: I see. I see.\nphd a: and with VAD uh, binary labels so that we can uh, get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream. So.\nprofessor d: I see. So we So. First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them. Without putting in a second path.\nphd a: Uh. You mean Oh, yeah! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK?\nprofessor d: Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we have we understand properly what things are, our very first thing to do is to is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK.\nphd a: Oh yeah. Yeah, OK. Mmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Uh, I mean, I don't know that we need to r\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um Do we need to retrain I mean we can just take the re their training files also. But. But, uh just for the testing, jus just make sure that we get the same results so we can duplicate it before we add in another \nphd a: Mmm. OK.\nprofessor d: Cuz otherwise, you know, we won't know what things mean.\nphd a: Oh, yeah. OK. And um. Yeah, so fff, LogRASTA, I don't know if we want to We can try networks with LogRASTA filtered features.\nprofessor d: Maybe.\nphd a: Mmm. I 'm sorry? Yeah. Well Yeah. But \nprofessor d: Oh! You know, the other thing is when you say comb I 'm I 'm sorry, I 'm interrupting. that u Um, uh, when you 're talking about combining multiple features, um Suppose we said, \" OK, we 've got these different features and so forth, but PLP seems pretty good. \" If we take the approach that Mike did and have \nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: I mean, one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions. We have different languages, we have different different noises, Um If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps with them.\nphd a: \nprofessor d: And put put them together. What what What Mike found, for the reverberation case at least, I mean I mean, who knows if it 'll work for these other ones. That you did have nice interpolative effects. That is, that yes, if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that, then you got the best results. But if you had, say, a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case, uh, and then you fed the thing, uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two. So it was sort of behaved reasonably. Is tha that a fair Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. So you you think it's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but \nprofessor d: It works better if what?\nphd a: Yea\nprofessor d: I see. Well, see, i oc You were doing some something that was So maybe the analogy isn't quite right. You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved. You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh, uh, reverberation. Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data. But we have s f for this kind of task, I would think, sort of a modest amount. I mean, a million frames actually isn't that much. We have a modest amount of of uh training data from a couple different conditions, and then uh in yeah, that and the real situation is that there's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language, and noise type uh, and uh, uh, channel characteristic, sort of all over the map. A bunch of different dimensions. And so, I 'm just concerned that we don't really have um, the data to train up I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in we still don't have a good explanation for this, but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh, a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh, when we just take one of those databases that's a pretty good one, it actually is is is is is better. And uh that says to me, yes, that, you know, there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that. But one way or another we don't have uh, seemingly, the ability to represent, in the neural net of the size that we have, um, all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering. So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that um, this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making, which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets, uh, that uh if we if they look at more constrained conditions they they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nphd a: So doing both is is not is not right, you mean, or? Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah. I I just sort of have a feeling \nphd a: But Yeah. Mm - hmm. \nprofessor d: Yeah. I mean i i e The um I think it's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA RASTA, which is a kind of LogRASTA, it's just that they have the I mean it's done in the log domain, as I recall, and it's it uh it's just that they d it's trained up, right? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization. So they did At least in their case, it did seem to be somewhat complimentary. So will it be in our case, where we 're using the neural net? I mean they they were not not using the neural net. Uh I don't know. OK, so the other things you have here are uh, trying to improve results from a single Yeah. Make stuff better. OK. Uh. Yeah. And CPU memory issues. Yeah. We 've been sort of ignoring that, haven't we?\nphd a: Yeah, so I don't know.\nprofessor d: But \nphd a: But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we \nprofessor d: Yeah, but I li Well, I think My impression You you folks have been looking at this more than me. But my impression was that uh, there was a a a a strict constraint on the delay,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better, and using less CPU was better. Something like that,\nphd a: Yeah, but \nprofessor d: right?\nphd a: Yeah. So, yeah, but we 've I don't know. We have to get some reference point to where we Well, what's a reasonable number? Perhaps be because if it's if it's too large or large or @ @ \nprofessor d: Um, well I don't think we 're um completely off the wall. I mean I think that if we if we have Uh, I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do If we find uh I mean we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L You know, if the MLP ultimately, after all is said and done, doesn't really help then we won't have it in.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: If the MLP does, we find, help us enough in some conditions, uh, we might even have more than one MLP. We could simply say that is uh, done on the uh, server.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: And it's uh We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that. So, I I I think I think that's  that's OK.\nphd a: And Yeah.\nprofessor d: So I think the key thing was um, this plug into OGI. Um, what what are they What are they gonna be working Do we know what they 're gonna be working on while we take their features,\nphd a: They 're They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band.\nprofessor d: and?\nphd a: So. Um This that was Pratibha. Sunil, what was he doing, do you remember?\nphd b: Sunil?\nphd a: Yeah. He was doing something new or?\nphd b: I I don't re I didn't remember. Maybe he's working with neural network.\nphd a: I don't think so. Trying to tune wha networks?\nphd b: Yeah, I think so.\nphd a: I think they were also mainly, well, working a little bit of new things, like networks and multi - band, but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now to just trying to get the best from this this architecture.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: \nprofessor d: OK. So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get There 'd be some point where you say, \" OK, this is their version - one \" or whatever, and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: and then um, uh, that's what we work with. We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then um, uh, when it gets to be uh, January some point uh, we say, \" OK we we have shown that we can improve this, in this way. So now uh um what's your newest version? \" And then maybe they 'll have something that's better and then we we 'd combine it. This is always hard. I mean I I I used to work with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh, HMM system with uh with a neural net system and uh, it was a common problem that you 'd Oh, and this Actually, this is true not just for neural nets but just for in general if people were working with uh, rescoring uh, N - best lists or lattices that come came from uh, a mainstream recognizer. Uh, You get something from the the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring. But they 're working really hard, too. So by the time you have uh, improved their score, they have also improved their score\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: and now there isn't any difference,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: because the other \nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So, um, I guess at some point we 'll have to\nphd a: So it's \nprofessor d: uh  Uh, I I don't know. I think we 're we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases. I think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing we can we e e\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things, presumably uh, in a in a day we could turn around uh, taking a new set of things from them and and rescoring it,\nphd a: Mmm. Yeah. Yeah, perhaps we could.\nprofessor d: right? So. Yeah. Well, OK. No, this is I think this is good. I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh, you know, different trainings. You know, da training targets and noises and so forth.\nphd a: Mmm. So we we can for we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps,\nprofessor d: That's sort of wide open.\nphd a: or focus more on the targets and on the training data and?\nprofessor d: Yeah, I think for right now um, I th I I really liked MSG. And I think that, you know, one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties. And um, I think that there is ultimately a really good uh, potential for, you know, bringing in things with different temporal properties. Um, but um, uh, we only have limited time and there's a lot of other things we have to look at.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets, and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing, and, you know, with limited time. Yeah. I think we have to start cutting down.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: So uh I think so, yeah. And then, you know, once we Um, having gone through this process and trying many different things, I would imagine that certain things uh, come up that you are curious about uh, that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh, I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most, you know, got you most interested uh and uh and and work with it, you know, for the next round. Uh, as you can tell from these numbers uh, nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: So. So, there 'll still be plenty to do. Barry, you 've been pretty quiet.\ngrad c: Just listening.\nprofessor d: Well I figured that, but That what what what were you involved in in this primarily?\ngrad c: Um, helping out uh, preparing Well, they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh, uh w doing some work on the on the preparing all all the data for them to to um, train and to test on. Um Yeah. Right now, I 'm I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan's class.\nprofessor d: Ah!\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: I see. Right. What's what's that?\ngrad c: Um, I 'm trying to um So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this this multi - band um, belief - net structure. This guy did \nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad c: uh basically it was two H M Ms with with a with a dependency arrow between the two H M\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\ngrad c: And so I wanna try try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band. I wanna try having the arrows go both ways. And um, I 'm just gonna see if if that that better models um, uh asynchrony in any way or um  Yeah.\nprofessor d: Oh! OK. Well, that sounds interesting.\ngrad c: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. Alright. Anything to you wanted to No. OK. Silent partner in the in the meeting. Oh, we got a laugh out of him, that's good. OK, everyone h must contribute to the our our sound sound files here. OK, so speaking of which, if we don't have anything else that we need You happy with where we are?\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: Know know wher know where we 're going? Uh \nphd a: I think so, yeah.\nprofessor d: Yeah, yeah. You you happy?\nphd b: \nprofessor d: You 're happy. OK everyone should be happy. OK. You don't have to be happy. You 're almost done. Yeah, yeah. OK.\ngrad e: Al - actually I should mention So if  um, about the Linux machine \" Swede. \"\nprofessor d: Yeah.\ngrad e: So it looks like the um, neural net tools are installed there.\nphd a: Mmm.\ngrad e: And um Dan Ellis I believe knows something about using that machine so\nphd a: Mmm.\ngrad e: If people are interested in in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that.\nphd a: Yeah, but I don't know if we really need now a lot of machines. Well. we could start computing another huge table but yeah, we \nprofessor d: Well. Yeah, I think we want a different table, at least\nphd a: Yeah, sure.\nprofessor d: Right? I mean there's there's some different things that we 're trying to get at now.\nphd a: But \nprofessor d: But \nphd a: Yeah. Mmm.\nprofessor d: So.

{"fname": "academic_dev_40", "dialogue": "grad a: Mm - hmm, hmm.\ngrad e: OK, side one.\ngrad f: I keep, uh, like, pointing forward to it. Yeah. Now we 'll go back to s OK, so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it, which is, um, the discourse situation context record, right? So I didn't I I meant just like draw a line and like, you know, you also have, uh, some tracking of what was going on.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: And sort of this is a big scale comment before I, you know, look into the details of this. But for instance you could imagine instead of having I I changed the name of um it used to be \" entities \". So you see it's \" scenario \", \" referent \" and \" discourse segment \". And \" scenario \" is essentially what kind of what's the basic predication, what event happened. And actually it's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture, a bunch of frames, bi and bindings, right? Um, and obviously there are other ones that are not included here, general cultural frames and general like, uh, other action f\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: you know, specific X - schema frames. OK, whatever. The middle thing used to be \" entities \" because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information. And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh, you know, about some entity that you were going to talk about. So \" Harry walked into the room \", \" Harry \" and \" room \", you know, the room th but they would be represented in this list somehow. And it could also have for instance, it has this category slot. Um, it should be either category or in or instance. Basically, it could be a pointer to ontology. So that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in. But the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number, gender, um ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that, um, you need to figure out wheth if it's a group whether, um, some event is happening, linear time, linear spaces, like, you know, are are they doing something serially or is it like, um, uh I 'm I 'm not sure. Because this partly came from, uh, Talmy's schema and I 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually. But Um, and then the \" status \" I used was like, again, in some languages, you know, like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status. So, th the the big com and and finally \" discourse segment \" is about sort of speech - act - y information structure - y, like utterance - specific kinds of things. So the comment I was going to make about, um, changing entity the entity's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse like situation context, you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to. And you might that might be sort of a general, I don't know, database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to. And I changed to \" reference \" cuz I would say, for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it. And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here. For instance, I know it's going to be plural. I know it's gonna be feminine or something like that. And and these could actually just point to, you know, the the ID in my other list of enti active entities, right? So, um, uh, th there's there's all this stuff about discourse status. We 've talked about. I almost listed \" discourse status \" as a slot where you could say it's active. You know, there's this, um, hierarchy uh there's a schematization of, you know, things can be active or they can be, um, accessible, inaccessible.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: It was the one that, you know, Keith, um, emailed to us once, to some of us, not all of us. And the thing is that that I noticed that that, um, list was sort of discourse dependent. It was like in this particular set, s you know, instance, it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been,\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not active.\nprofessor c: This Uh yeah, well there there seems to be context properties.\ngrad f: So.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, they 're contex and for instance, I used to have a location thing there but actually that's a property of the situation. And it's again, time, you know at cert certain points things are located, you know, near or far from you\nprofessor c: Well, uh, uh, this is recursive\ngrad f: and \nprofessor c: cuz until we do the uh, mental space story, we 're not quite sure  Th - th\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: which is fine. We 'll just we 'll j\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah. So some of these are, uh \nprofessor c: we just don't know yet.\ngrad f: Right. So I so for now I thought, well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance, right? Everything else here is utterance - specific. Um, and I left the slot, \" predications \", open because you can have, um, things like \" the guy I know from school \".\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Or, you know, like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know, predications that you might make. And it's unclear whether I mean, you could just have in your scenario, \" here are some extra few things that are true \", right?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And then you could just sort of not have this slot here. Right? You 're but but it's used for identification purposes.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: So it's it's a little bit different from just saying \" all these things are true from my utterance \".\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Um.\ngrad e: Right, \" this guy I know from school came for dinner \" does not mean, um, \" there's a guy, I know him from school, and he came over for dinner \". That's not the same effect.\ngrad f: Yeah, it's a little bit it's a little bit different. Right? So Or maybe that's like a restrictive, non - restrictive \ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: you know, it's like it gets into that kind of thing for um, but maybe I 'm mixing, you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So you might imagine that the information you pass to, you know in identifying a particular referent would be, \" oh, some \" you know, \" it's a guy and it's someone I know from school \".\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: So maybe that would, you know, be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the, whatever, construal engine or whatever, discourse context, to find you know, either create this reference,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: in which case it 'd be created here, and you know, so so you could imagine that this might not So, uh, I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things.\ngrad a: But to make it m precise at least in my mind, uh, it's not precise.\ngrad f: Um.\ngrad a: So \" house \" is gender neuter?

If you take the second set of experiment for Italian, so, the mismatched condition,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: um when we use the training on TIMIT so, it's multi - English, we have a ninety - one number,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: and training with other languages is a little bit worse.\nprofessor d: Um Oh, I see. Down near the bottom of this sheet.\nphd a: So,\nprofessor d: Uh,  yes.\nphd a: yeah.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: And, yeah, and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta. If y if I take the training s the large training set, it's we have one hundred and seventy - two,\nprofessor d: Yes.\nphd a: and one hundred and four when we use delta.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: Uh. Even if the contexts used is quite the same,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: because without delta we use seventeenths seventeen frames. Uh. Yeah, um, so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments, uh, that we did not have last week. Uh, so this is training the net on French only, or on English only, and testing on Italian.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on, uh TI - digits.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And, fff um, yeah. What we see is that these nets are not as good, except for the multi - English, which is always one of the best. Yeah, then we started to work on a large dat database containing, uh, sentences from the French, from the Spanish, from the TIMIT, from SPINE, uh from uh English digits, and from Italian digits. So this is the another line another set of lines in the table. Uh, @ @ with SPINE\nprofessor d: Ah, yes. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: and uh, actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data, uh, so we have to to redo the uh the experiment training the net with, uh PLP, but with delta. But\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: um this this net performed quite well. Well, it's it's better than the net using French, Spanish, and English only. Uh. So, uh, yeah. We have also started feature combination experiments. Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together. And this is The results are on the other document. Uh, we can discuss this after, perhaps well, just, @ @. Yeah, so basically there are four four kind of systems. The first one, yeah, is combining, um, two feature streams, uh using and each feature stream has its own MPL. So it's the kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first. The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal. The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs. And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs. Um, yeah. Mmm. You know you can you can comment these results,\nphd b: Yes, I can s I would like to say that, for example, um, mmm, if we doesn't use the delta - delta, uh we have an improve when we use s some combination. But when\nphd a: Yeah, we ju just to be clear, the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy.\nphd b: w Yeah, this Yeah, this number recognition acc\nphd a: So it's not the Again we switch to another \nphd b: Yes, and the baseline the baseline have i is eighty - two.\nprofessor d: Baseline is eighty - two.\nphd b: Yeah\nphd a: So it's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this.\nprofessor d: Uh, this is Italian mismatched.\nphd a: Um.\nphd b: Yeah, by the moment.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd b: And first in the experiment - one I I do I I use different MLP,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better. Um. for the ne rest of experiment I use multi - English, only multi - English. And I try to combine different type of feature, but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy.\nphd a: Yeah, eh, actually, if w we look at the table, the huge table, um, we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So, um uh, well, I don't think this is a bug but this this is something in probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly. Perhaps the fact that the the there's no low - pass filter, well, or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian, or, well, something simple like that. But that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And as Carmen said, if we combine the two, we have the result, basically, of PLP.\nprofessor d: I Um, the uh, baseline system when you said the baseline system was uh, uh eighty - two percent, that was trained on what and tested on what? That was, uh Italian mismatched d uh, uh, digits, uh, is the testing,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: and the training is Italian digits?\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and and, uh microphone and so forth,\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: right? So, um did we have So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is is the uh Italian digits?\nphd b: The train the training of the HTK?\nprofessor d: The \nphd b: Yes. Ah yes!\nprofessor d: Yes.\nphd b: This h Yes. Th - Yes.\nprofessor d: Yes. Training of the net,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: yeah. So, um So what that says is that in a matched condition, we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP. Now w would do we have a number, I suppose for the matched I I don't mean matched, but uh use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only?\nphd b: Uh yes?\nphd a: Uh yeah, so this is basically this is in the table. Uh so the number is fifty - two,\nphd b: Another table.\nphd a: uh \nprofessor d: Fifty - two percent.\nphd a: Fift - So No, it's it's the \nphd b: No.\nprofessor d: No, fifty - two percent of eighty - two?\nphd a: Of of of uh eighteen \nphd b: Eighty.\nphd a: of eighteen.\nphd b: Eighty.\nphd a: So it's it's error rate, basically.\nphd b: It's plus six.\nphd a: It's er error rate ratio. So \nprofessor d: Oh this is accuracy! \nphd a: Uh, so we have nine nine let's say ninety percent.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Oy! OK. Ninety.\nphd a: Yeah. Um which is uh what we have also if use PLP and MSG together,\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: eighty - nine point seven.\nprofessor d: OK, so even just PLP, uh, it is not, in the matched condition Um I wonder if it's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra, or whether it's that the net half, for some reason, is not helping.\nphd a: Uh. P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same same results.\nprofessor d: Same result pretty much?\nphd a: Well, we have these results. I don't know. It's not Do you have this result with PLP alone, j fee feeding HTK?\nprofessor d: So, s\nphd a: That That's what you mean?\nphd b: Yeah,\nphd a: Just PLP at the input of HTK.\nphd b: yeah yeah yeah yeah, at the first and the Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. So, PLP \nprofessor d: Eighty - eight point six.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um, so adding MSG\nphd a: Um \nprofessor d: um Well, but that's yeah, that's without the neural net,\nphd a: Yeah, that's without the neural net\nprofessor d: right?\nphd a: and that's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization.\nprofessor d: But she had said eighty - two.\nphd a: This is the w well, but this is without on - line normalization.\nprofessor d: Right? Oh, this the eighty - two.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: \nphd a: Eighty - two is the it's the Aurora baseline, so MFCC. Then we can use well, OGI, they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization\nprofessor d: Oh, I 'm sorry, I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy.\nphd a: Yeah, sorry. Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. Alright.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Alright. So this is I was thinking all this was worse. OK so this is all better\nphd b: Yes, better.\nprofessor d: because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. I 'm I 'm all better now. OK, go ahead.\nphd a: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh, when we apply a neural network, is the same. We j jump to ninety percent.\nphd b: Nnn, we don't know exactly.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: And And um whatever the normalization, actually. If we use n neural network, even if the features are not correctly normalized, we jump to ninety percent. So \nprofessor d: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety, or something.\nphd a: Well, ninety No, I I mean ninety It's around eighty - nine, ninety, eighty - eight.\nprofessor d: Eighty - nine.\nphd a: Well, there are minor minor differences.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: And then adding the MSG does nothing, basically.\nphd a: No.\nprofessor d: Yeah. OK.\nphd a: Uh For Italian, yeah.\nprofessor d: For this case, right?\nphd a: Um.\nprofessor d: Alright. So, um So actually, the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG, if you uh does not help in that case.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Um \nphd a: But w Yeah.\nprofessor d: The other ones, we 'd have to look at it, but And the multi - English, does uh So if we think of this in error rates, we start off with, uh eighteen percent error rate, roughly.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Um and we uh almost, uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net.\nphd a: Yeah\nprofessor d: And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things.\nphd a: No.\nprofessor d: And we cut off, I guess about twenty - five percent of the error. Uh no, not quite that, is it. Uh, two point six out of eighteen. About, um sixteen percent or something of the error, um, if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition.\nphd a: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Not matching condition, but uh, the uh, Italian training.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd b: We select these these these tasks because it's the more difficult.\nprofessor d: Yes, good. OK? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gonna have matching, uh, data for the uh for the new for the other languages and so forth. Um, one qu thing is that, uh I think I asked you this before, but I wanna double check. When you say \" ME \" in these other tests, that's the multi - English,\nphd a: That's it's a part it's \nprofessor d: but it is not all of the multi - English, right? It is some piece of part of it.\nphd a: Or, one million frames.\nprofessor d: And the multi - English is how much?\nphd b: You have here the information.\nphd a: It's one million and a half. Yeah.\nprofessor d: Oh, so you used almost all You used two thirds of it,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: you think. So, it it's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: I wonder why Yeah. Uh.\ngrad c: Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled,\nphd a: Yeah, it's \nphd b: Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad c: the French and the Spanish.\nphd b: The Spanish. Maybe for that.\nprofessor d: Hmm.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor d: It's still OK. Alright, go ahead. And then then \nphd b: Um. Mmm, with the experiment type - two, I first I tried to to combine, nnn, some feature from the MLP and other feature another feature.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And we s we can first the feature are without delta and delta - delta, and we can see that in the situation, uh, the MSG - three, the same help nothing.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta PLP delta and delta - delta. And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta. And we have a l little bit less result than the the the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Maybe if when we have the new the new neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta, maybe the final result must be better. I don't know.\nphd a: Actually, just to be some more \nphd b: Uh \nphd a: Do This number, this eighty - seven point one number, has to be compared with the\nprofessor d: Yes, yeah, I mean it can't be compared with the other\nphd a: Which number?\nprofessor d: cuz this is, uh with multi - English, uh, training.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box, which is that, uh the eighty - four point six.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Right?\nphd a: Uh.\nprofessor d: So \nphd a: Yeah, but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: and straight features with delta - delta. And straight features with delta - delta gives you what's on the first sheet.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Not t not\nphd a: It's eight eighty - eight point six.\nprofessor d: tr No. No. No.\nphd b: Yes.\nprofessor d: Not trained with multi - English.\nphd a: Uh, yeah, but th this is the second configuration.\nphd b: No, but they they feature @ @ without \nphd a: So we use feature out uh, net outputs together with features. So yeah, this is not perhaps not clear here but in this table, the first column is for MLP and the second for the features.\nprofessor d: Eh. Oh, I see. Ah. So you 're saying w so asking the question, \" What what has adding the MLP done to improve over the,\nphd a: So, just Yeah so, actually it it it decreased the the accuracy.\nprofessor d: uh \nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Yes.\nphd a: Because we have eighty - eight point six.\nprofessor d: Uh - huh.\nphd a: And even the MLP alone What gives the MLP alone? Multi - English PLP. Oh no, it gives eighty - three point six. So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six,\nphd b: But \nphd a: that gives eighty - seven point one.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm. Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh, OK, eighty - three point six and eighty eighty - eight point six.\nphd a: Eighty - three point six. Eighty \nprofessor d: OK.\nphd a: Is th is that right? Yeah?\nphd b: Yeah. But I don't know but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP delta and delta - delta, maybe tha this can help.\nphd a: Perhaps, yeah.\nprofessor d: Well, that's that's one thing, but see the other thing is that, um, I mean it's good to take the difficult case, but let's let's consider what that means. What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that I mean my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this, as motivation. When we train on data that is in one sense or another, similar to the testing data, then we get a win by having discriminant training.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: When we train on something that's quite different, we have a potential to have some problems.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: And, um, if we get something that helps us when it's somewhat similar, and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it's quite different, that's maybe not so bad.\nphd a: Yeah. Mmm.\nprofessor d: So the question is, if you took the same combination, and you tried it out on, uh on say digits,\nphd a: On TI - digits? OK.\nprofessor d: you know, d Was that experiment done?\nphd a: No, not yet.\nprofessor d: Yeah, OK. Uh, then does that, eh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth, does it does it then look much better?\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh of tests? So, an anyway. OK, go ahead.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: And, with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven, uh, d I have found more or less the same result.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So, it's slightly better,\nphd b: Little bit better?\nphd a: yeah.\nprofessor d: Slightly better.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Slightly bet better. Yes, is better.\nprofessor d: And and you know again maybe if you use the, uh, delta there, uh, you would bring it up to where it was, uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case.\nphd b: Yeah, maybe. Maybe. Maybe.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Oh, yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. Well, so perhaps let's let's jump at the last experiment.\nphd b: Oh, yeah.\nprofessor d: So.\nphd a: It's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output.\nphd b: i\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: It's again better. So it's eighty - nine point point one.\nphd b: Yeah,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and we have only forty forty feature\nphd a: So.\nphd b: because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah. And then w with the first configuration, I f I am found that work, uh, doesn't work \nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd b: uh, well, work, but is better, the second configuration. Because I for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta, here I have eighty - five point three accuracy, and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one.", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion about the results from the experiments", "zh_query": "总结关于实验结果的讨论", "fr_query": "Résumer la discussion sur les résultats des expériences", "ukr_query": "Підведіть підсумки обговорення результатів експериментів", "en_summary": "Last run of experiments showed that adding more languages was still severely harming model performance.

Imagine you 're the the subject. You 're gonna be in here, and somebody And and you see, uh, either th the three - D model, or uh, a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg. So you actually see that. Um. The uh, um, first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg. So, just off a textbook, uh, tourist guide, to familiarize, uh, yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names, like Fischergasse and so forth. So that's part one. Part two is, you 're told that this huge new, wonderful computer system exists, that can y tell you everything you want to know, and it understands you completely. And so you 're gonna pick up that phone, dial a number, and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve. First you have to know find out how to get to that place, maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there.

Oh, and one one little bit w And uh, the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are, via GPS. When the human operator comes on, um, that person does not know.

{"fname": "academic_dev_4", "dialogue": "professor e: And and the I mean, the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from I 'll I 'll talk to you more about it later is that is that there's there's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably, uh related to, you know, legal issues and and permissions and all that. I mean, they already do what they do do whatever they do. So it's uh, it's So it's so it's another source. So I think it's something we should look into, you know, we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um and maybe we have this other source. But yeah I think that it's not unreasonable to aim at getting, you know, significantly in excess of a hundred hours. I mean, that was sort of our goal. The thing was, I was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect, you know, thirty to fifty hours. And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester. And if we continue to collect some next semester, I think we should, uh \nphd c: Right. Yeah I was mostly trying to think, \" OK, if you start a project, within say a month, you know, how much data do you have to work with. And you you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your your data for awhile so um right now and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right? Do Oh, do we now?\nprofessor e: Well, we don't even have it for this f you know, forty - five minutes, that was \nphd c: So um, not complaining, I was just trying to think, you know, what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: and they 're pretty different, because\nprofessor e: Yeah. So I was thinking right now it's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data, you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like,\ngrad g: Right.\nphd c: um Right. Right, right.\nprofessor e: and and and uh and meanwhile we collect, and it's more like yeah, three months from now, or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things.\nphd c: Cuz I 'm not actually sure, just logistically that I can spend you know, I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early, before there's enough data to make good use of the time. And that's and especially with the student\ngrad g: Right.\nphd c: uh for instance this guy who seems \nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: Uh anyway, I shouldn't say too much, but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring, how much data will I have to work with, with that person. And so it's \nprofessor e: i Yeah, so I would think, exploratory things now. Uh, three months from now Um, I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing, but I think as far as the collection, it doesn't seem to me l like, uh, unreasonable to say that uh in January, you know, ro roughly uh which is roughly three months from now, we should have at least something like, you know, twenty - five, thirty hours.\nphd c: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that,\nprofessor e: So that's \npostdoc b: Yeah, we need to I think that there's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards,\nphd c: so. I mean, it \npostdoc b: and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions.\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor e: Yeah.", "en_query": "What’s the current status of recordings and transcriptions?", "zh_query": "录音和转录现状如何？", "fr_query": "Quel est l'état actuel des enregistrements et des transcriptions ?", "ukr_query": "Який поточний стан записів та транскрипцій?", "en_summary": "Approximately 12-13 hours of Meeting Recorder data have been collected, roughly 45 minutes of which have been transcribed.

{"fname": "academic_dev_6", "dialogue": "grad b: \ngrad d: How many batteries do you go through?\ngrad b: Thank you.\nprofessor c: Alright.\nphd a: Sure.\nprofessor c: Good. Yeah. OK so, let's get started. Nancy said she's coming and that means she will be. Um. My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week's adventures uh to start. So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh, uh, actually from uh DFKI uh, part of the German SmartKom project, who were here for the week and, I think got a lot done.\ngrad e: Yeah, I think so too. Um. The we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system, and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like \" Roman numeral one, am Smarticus. \" It actually says, \" Roemisch einz, am Smarticus, \"\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: which means it's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: So uh,\nprofessor c: It doesn't know \" I \".\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: Um, the uh\ngrad b: Oh, Am Spartacus. \"\ngrad d: \" I am Sm - I am Smarticus \" is what it's saying.\nphd a: Right.\ngrad b: Verstehe. OK.\ngrad d: I gue\ngrad e: The uh sythesis is just a question of um, hopefully it's just a question of exchanging a couple of files, once we have them. And, um, it's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach. So I 'm I 'm I 'm going backwards now, so \" synthesis \" is where you sort of make this uh, make these sounds, and \" concept to speech \" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said, and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better, presumably. Then, just with text to speech.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And, uh, Johno learned how to write XML tags. Uh, and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some some sentences. No, right?\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah, for a couple \ngrad d: So. Bu - Uh, i The way the uh, the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know, or what it wants to tell the person, to a er in XML and there's a conversion system for different uh, to go from XML to something else. And th so, the knowledge base for the system, that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh, in a LISP - like the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form. And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog. So, you have a basically, a goal and it, you know, says \" OK, well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: so it just starts uh, it binds some variables and it just decides to, you know, do some subscold. Basically, it just means \" build the tree. \"\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad d: And then it passes the tree onto, uh, the ge the generation module.\ngrad e: But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do, we 've already written the the syntax trees for three or four.\ngrad d: We yeah. So, the syntax trees are very simple. It's like most of the sentences in one tree,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: and instead of, you know, breaking down to, like, small units and building back up, they basically took the sentences, and basically cut them in half, or you know, into thirds or something like that, and made trees out of those. And so uh, uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML, uh, tree. Uh, S what do ca structure from the from the LISP. And so basically you just say, you know, \" noun goes to \", you know, Er, nah, I don't re I 've never been good at those. So there's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP, and it will generate for you.\ngrad b: OK. N, N, V yeah, OK. Alright.\ngrad e: And because we 're sticking to that structure, the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed. So all that f fancy stuff, and the Texas speech version of it, which is actually the simpler version, is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us. So. This way we we worked around that. The, uh the system, um I can show you the system. I actually want, at least, maybe, you should be able to start it on your own. If you wanna play around with it, in th in the future. Right now it's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on on on on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it, anything. And send in a a a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it's designed for this seevit thing, where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen, which we don't have here.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And so we 're doing it via mouse, but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was It was a lot of engineering stuff. No science in there whatsoever, but it's working now, and um, that's the good news. So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation.\ngrad d: Why I had I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones, mainly because you know like uh, the gerund in in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb,\ngrad e: You have to switch it on.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: so I 'd uh have to add \" am walking, \"\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad d: or I 'd have to add a little stem for the \" am \", when I build the built the tree.\ngrad b: OK. Yeah, I noticed that um, that some of the examples they had, had you know, non - English word orders and so on, you know. And then all that good stuff. So.\nprofessor c: Alright.\ngrad d: Yeah.\ngrad b: Like.\nprofessor c: So it might be worth, Keith, you looking at this,\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: um\ngrad b: I I still don't I still don't really understand e like \ngrad d: Well Tilman s\ngrad b: I mean we sort of say, um You know, I I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in in this thing, or what the modules are and so on. So, you know, like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user, and then magically it sort of s\nprofessor c: Yeah \ngrad b: I mean, how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out, and all that?\nprofessor c: I thi Yeah. So. I think it's not worth going over in the group,\ngrad b: R uh Sure.\nprofessor c: but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it.\ngrad b: Yeah, soon. OK.\nprofessor c: And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together.\ngrad b: That's fine.\nprofessor c: It's eee messy but once you understand it you understand it. It's it's There's nothing really complicated about it.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: No.\ngrad b: And I remember one thing that that came up in the talk last Wednesday. Um, was this, I I think he talked about the idea of like, um He was talking about these lexicalized uh, uh, tree adjoining grammars where you sort of for each word you, um \ngrad d: OK, you know how to do it?\ngrad b: For each lexical item, the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in. And of course, that's not v That's the opposite of constructional. That's, you know, that's that's HPSG or whatever.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad b: You know?\nprofessor c: Right. Now, we 're we 're not committed for our research to do any of those things.\ngrad b: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So uh we are committed for our funding.\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor c: OK? to uh \ngrad b: Make our stuff fit to that.\nprofessor c: Yeah, to n no, to just get the dem get the demos they need.\ngrad b: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: OK? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need. If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by, you know, tapping into other things we do, that's great.\ngrad d: You should probably move the microphone closer to your face.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts\ngrad d: There's like a little The twisty thing, you can move it with.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: and, s deliberately. So, the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what's going on in this demo system is not because it's important to the research. It's just for closure. So that if we come up with a question of \" could we fit this deeper stuff in there? \" or something. You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in.\ngrad b: Right. OK.\nprofessor c: So it's just, uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what's there. Is there anything we can make use of? Uh, is there anything we can give back, beyond th the sort of minimum requirements? But none of that has a short time fuse.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something. And then So, it's probably fifteen months or something until there's another serious demo requirement.\ngrad b: Oh OK.\nprofessor c: That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months,\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor c: but it means we can not think about it for six months.\ngrad b: Right, yeah.\nprofessor c: So. The plan for this summer uh, really is to step back from the applied project,\ngrad e: Right.\nprofessor c: keep the d keep the context open, but actually go after the basic issues.\ngrad b: Hmm. Oh OK.\nprofessor c: And, so The idea is there's this uh, other subgroup that's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation. But sort of in parallel with that, uh, the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other anything lik any other constraints for the time being.\ngrad b: Yeah. OK. Got it.\nprofessor c: It's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then and get the constructions in their form and stuff.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: And, I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints.\ngrad b: Right, OK.\nprofessor c: Um. And similarly with the parsing, uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh, the general case you know, construction parser for general constructions. And, if we need a cut - down version for something, or whatever, we 'll worry about that later.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: So I 'd like to, for the summer turn into science mode.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: And I assume that's also, uh, your plan as well.\ngrad b: So I mean, the the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been sort of been geared towards this demo,\nprofessor c: Right. Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad b: and then that's going to go away pretty soon.\nprofessor c: But but we we 're swit\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad b: And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: It's \nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: huh?\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: It's got. What I what I think is is a good idea that I can can show to anyone who's interested, we can even make a sort of an internal demo, and I I show you what I do,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: I speak into it and you hear it talk,\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: and I can sort of walk f through the information. So, this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes. Just fun.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: And so you when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can, sort of, give a sensible answer.\ngrad b: Right. OK.\nprofessor c: So, c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing? Just give a talk in the big room, and and so peo people know what's going on? when you 're ready?\ngrad e: Absolutely.\nprofessor c: Yeah I mean, that's the kind of thing That's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say \" this is a project that we 've been working on and here's a demo version of it \" and stuff like that.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad e: OK. Well d we we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're \ngrad b: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: Indeed.\ngrad e: Yeah. OK. Makes sense.\nprofessor c: But any so that e e It's clear, then, I think. Actually, roughly starting uh let's say, nex next meeting, cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report.\ngrad b: Yeah. OK.\nprofessor c: But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where Uh. I mean there are a lot of issues, what's the ontology look like,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: you know what do the constructions look like, what's the execution engine look like, mmm lots of things.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But, more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out. Now before we do that, let's get back in Oh! But, it's still, I think, useful for you to understand the demo version enough, so that you can can see what what it is that that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something.\ngrad b: Yeah. OK, right.\nprofessor c: And Johno's already done that, uh, looked at the dem uh the looked at the SmartKom stuff.\ngrad d: Wa uh To some de uh what what part of th the SmartKom stuff?\nprofessor c: Well, the parser, and that stuff.\ngrad d: Oh yeah yeah.\nprofessor c: OK. Anyway. So, the trip the report on these the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week.\ngrad b: Yeah. It's alright.\ngrad e: Um. Well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is,\nprofessor c: Maybe you 're done, then.\ngrad e: and if you just take the And I g I got the feeling that we are the only ones right now who have a running system. I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version that is, the full version that's on the server d does not work. And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work. And so it's And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \". So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now, the system the integration group. And it was, uh It was fun to some extent, but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman um, I know that they enjoyed it here, and they r they they liked, uh, a lot of the stuff they saw here, what what we have been thinking about, and they 're more than willing to to um, cooperate, by all means. And um, part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML, make that open to all of us and them, so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and and generating and constructions w we we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um, get some overlap, get some synergy out of that. And um, the, uh If I find someone at in EML that is interested in that, um I I may even think that we could look take constructions and and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism. And you can just do anything with it, whether it's syntactic trees, H P S G - like stuff, or whether it's construction. So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there, but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding, um, pipeline.\nprofessor c: Anyth - any other uh repo visit reports sort of stories? uh we so we now know I think, what the landscape is like.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And so we just push on and and uh, do what we need to do. And one of the things we need to do is the um, and this I think is relatively tight tightly constrained, is to finish up this belief - net stuff. So. Uh. And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions. OK so here's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it. Um. Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net, missing only the connections. Right? That is  So, he 'd put all th all the dots down, and we went through this, and, I think, more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of, were in there. Yeah we may run across one or two more. But of course the connections weren't. So, uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh, solved you know how to do this and stuff. And so Bhaskara tracked that down. The answer seems to be uh, \" no, no one has done it, but yes it's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that's what you set out to do \". And, so the current state of things is that, again, starting now, um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks. So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June, and uh, he's gonna leave us an inheritance, which is a uh hopefully a belief - net that does these things. And there 're two aspects to it, one of which is, you know, technical, getting the coding right, and making it run, and uh stuff like that. And the other is the actual semantics. OK? What all you know, what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate. So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that, that's something that we all have to work out. Is is that right? I mean that's that's both you guys ' understanding of where we are?\ngrad e: Absolutely.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad g: So, I guess, um Is there like a latest version of the belief - net of the proposed belief - net? Like \ngrad e: We had um decided \ngrad g: like \ngrad e: Um. Well, no, we didn't decide. We wanted to look into maybe getting it, the visualization, a bit clearer, but I think if we do it, um, sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them, that should suffice.\ngrad g: Mm - hmm. Yeah, that should be fine.\nprofessor c: Yeah I mean, that's a separate problem.\ngrad d: Yeah, I \nprofessor c: We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: That's separable, yeah.\ngrad d: I did look into that, uh in terms of, you know, exploding the nodes out and down ag\nprofessor c: Yep. Right.\ngrad d: JavaBayes does not support that. I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that. It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it,\nprofessor c: Not not at this point.\ngrad d: and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy's page,\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad d: and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and, with this thing that we want.\nprofessor c: Well, we can p If it's If we can pay Yeah. If you know it's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that. OK? So so don't view free as as a absolute constraint.\ngrad d: OK. OK, so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that \nprofessor c: OK. And you can ask Kevin.\ngrad e: But \ngrad g: Yeah.\ngrad d: Mmm.\ngrad e: But \ngrad g: Yeah, the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever?\nprofessor c: Hugin, yeah that's free.\ngrad g: How exp I don't think it's Is it free? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I it seems to \nprofessor c: Uh, it may be free to academics. Like I I don't know. I have a co I have a copy that I l I downloaded.\ngrad g: OK.\nprofessor c: So, at one point it was free.\ngrad g: OK.\nprofessor c: Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um,\ngrad d: How do you spell that?\nprofessor c: HUGIN.\ngrad f: Why\nprofessor c: And Bhaskara can give you a pointer. So then, in any case, um But paying a lit You know, if i if it's uh Probably for university, it's it's gonna be real cheap anyway. But um, you know, if it's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it. I 'm mean, we have no need for that.\ngrad e: I I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in in in changing the the JavaBayes code.\nprofessor c: No,\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: he's not gonna do that.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad e: I I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that, it's sort of a fish - eye. You you have a node, and you click on it, and it shows you all the connections,\ngrad d: Mmm.\ngrad e: and then if you click on something else that moves away, that goes into the middle. And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two. If that doesn't work, it's not a problem we we need to solve right now. What I 'm what my job is, I will, um, give you the input in terms of of the internal structure. Maybe node by node, or something like this? Or should I collect it all\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: and \nprofessor c: Doesn't matter.\ngrad g: Um, just any like like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best.\ngrad e: OK. And um you 're gonna be around? t again, always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish? As usual? Or will that change?\ngrad g: Yeah I mean, yeah, I can like I c Um. This week I guess um, kind of I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free. So yes, I might I can be around. And g I mean, generally if you email me also I can be around on other days.\ngrad e: Yeah. OK.\nprofessor c: Yeah and this is not a crisis that I mean, you do, e everybody who's a student should, you know do their work, get their c courses all in good shape and and and and then we 'll dig d dig down on this.\ngrad e: Yeah, that's Yeah. OK. No, that's good. That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it. So.\ngrad g: OK.\ngrad b: How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are? I know that there's an issue of how to weight the different things too, and stuff. Right? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of \nprofessor c: Right. Well there there there There 're two different things you do.\ngrad e: It's \nprofessor c: One is you design and the other is you learn. OK? So uh what we 're gonna do initially is is do design, and, i if you will, guess.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: OK. Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of of the domain to uh, hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff.\ngrad b: Right. OK.\nprofessor c: If it's done right, and if you have data then, there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and there are even techniques for learning the structure, although that takes a lot more data, and it's not as @ @ and so forth and so on. So uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it.\ngrad b: Alright.\ngrad e: Yeah. Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: So but this is the  long run.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad e: But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning.\ngrad b: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, oh, and by the way, speaking of data, um, are there I could swore uh, I could swear I saw it sitting on someone's desk at some point, but is there a um a transcript of any of the, sort of, initial interactions of people with the with the system? Cuz you know, I 'm still sort of itching to to look at what look at the stuff, and see what people are saying.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm. Yeah. Yeah make yourself a note. So and and, of course Keith would like the German as well as the English, so whatever you guys can get.\ngrad e: The German. Oh yeah, of course, German. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah, the y your native language, right? You remember that one.\ngrad e: OK. That's important, yeah.\ngrad b: Yeah,\nprofessor c: So he 'll get you some data.\ngrad b: u OK. Yeah, I mean I I sort of um found the uh, uh the audio of some of those, and um, it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that, you know.\ngrad e: Hmm.\ngrad b: It was just Strange, but.\nprofessor c: Yep.\ngrad e: We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs.\ngrad b: Oh yeah, OK.\ngrad e: Um, but uh that's th but we have data in English and German already.\ngrad b: OK, yeah, I mean.\ngrad e: So. Transcribed. I will send you that. OK.\nprofessor c: OK, so while we 're still at this sort of top level, anything else that we oughta talk about today?\ngrad e: Ho - how was your thingy.\ngrad b: Oh, um, I just wanted to, uh, s like mention as an issue, um, you know last meeting I wasn't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff,\nprofessor c: Oh right.\ngrad b: and that was pretty interesting and you know, I mean, seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know, \" What's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill, \" or something like that, you know, meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean, I 'm sure in terms of you know, people trying to state locations or, you know, all that kind of stuff, this is gonna be very relevant. So, um, now that was the talk was about English versus Japanese, um, which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly, except that, um, some of the construction he 'd what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know, \" your bike is parked across the street \" and we use these prepositional phrases, you know, \" well, if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike \", but um in in Japanese the the more conventionalized tendency is to use a sort of a description of \" where one has crossed to the river, there is a tree \". Um, and you know, you can actually say things like, um, \" there's a tree where one has crossed the river, but no one has ever crossed the river \", or something like that. So the idea is that this really is you know that's supposed show that's it's really fictive and so on. But um But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English, you know, like \" right where you start to go up the hill \", or \" just when you get off the train \", or something like that to uh, to indicate where something is.\nprofessor c: Mmm.\ngrad b: So we 'll have to think about \nprofessor c: So how much is that used in German?\ngrad e: Um. The uh Well I wa I was on a uh on a on a different sidetrack.\nprofessor c: Oh, OK.\ngrad e: I mean, the the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment, but this is a a three language project : German, English, Japanese.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: And um, we have a uh, uh I have taken care that we have the the Japanese generation and stuff. And so I looked into uh spatial description. So we can generate spatial descriptions, how to get from A to B. And and information on objects, in German, English, and Japanese.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh differences in spatial descriptions. Well, if yo if you 're interested in that, so how how, I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: So. Um.\nprofessor c: So, where is this huge project?\ngrad e: It's KLEIST. It's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: \nprofessor c: Well, that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: But um, I I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for for now,\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad e: but um definitely it's interesting to look at at cross the bordered there.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Are are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position of of the direction relative relative to the speaker? For example, there are some differences between Hebrew and English. We can say um \" park in front of the car \" as you come beh you drive behind the car. In Hebrew it means \" park behind the car \", because to follow the car is defined as it faces you.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Intrinsic, yeah.\nphd a: While in English, front of the car is the absolute front of the car.\ngrad b: OK.\nphd a: So.\ngrad b: Right, so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is.\nphd a: Right. Right.\ngrad b: OK.\nphd a: So, i i i is German uh closer to to E uh, uh, uh, uh to E I mean uh\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: I don't think it it's related to syntax, though, so it may be entirely different.\ngrad e: Um, as a matter of fact \nprofessor c: No, it's not.\ngrad b: Right.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad e: Um. Did you ever get to look at the the rou paper that I sent you on the on that problem in English and German?\ngrad b: I think \ngrad e: Carroll, ninety - three. Um. I There is a a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem.\nphd a: Hmm.\ngrad e: So it's they actually say \" the monkey in front of the car, where's the monkey? \"\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And, um, they found statistically very significant differences in English and German, so I I I It might be, since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it, that that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect.\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad e: The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors.\nphd a: That but it wasn't was \ngrad e: That syntactic facto factors do do play a role there, wh whether you 're more likely, you know, to develop uh, choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames.\nphd a: Right. Mm - hmm. Right.\ngrad b: I mean, it seems to me that you can get both in in English depending o\nprofessor c: Hmm.\ngrad b: You know, like, \" in front of the car \" could you know Like, here's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something's in front of the car, or whatever. I could see that,\nprofessor c: Absolutely.\ngrad b: but But anyway, so you know, I mean, this was this was a a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on. So uh.\ngrad e: I can also give you uh, a pointer to a paper of mine which is the the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames.\ngrad b: Alright! Cool!\ngrad e: So.\nprofessor c: Oh.\ngrad e: I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works.\nprofessor c: Oh.\ngrad e: Not really.\nprofessor c: Great. No, I 've not seen that.\nphd a: What do you mean. Um. \" reference frames \"?\ngrad e: It's called a \nphd a: uh uh\ngrad e: It's it's spatial reference frames. You actually have only Um. If you wanna have a This is usually um I should there should be an \" L \", though. Well actually you have only have two choices. You can either do a two - point or a three - point which is you You 're familiar with th with the \" origo \"? where that's the center \" Origo \" is the center of the f frame of reference.\ngrad b: Hmm.\ngrad e: And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized.\ngrad b: Hmm.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: OK? In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object.\nprofessor c: So that would be \" origin \" in English,\ngrad f: This was like \ngrad b: The origin.\nphd a: Right\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: right?\ngrad e: \" Origo \" is a Terminus technikus. in that sense, that's even used in the English literature. \" Origo. \"\ngrad b: Oh, OK. I never heard it.\nprofessor c: Alright.\nphd a: OK.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: And um, so, this video tape is in front of me.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Right.\ngrad e: Those are two - point.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And, reference object and Um. No, from from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair.\ngrad b: Right. You you can actually say things like, um, \" it's behind the tree from me \" or something like that, I think, in in in certain circumstances in English, right? As sort of \" from where I 'm standing it would appear that \" \ngrad e: Yeah. Yeah. So,\ngrad f: Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time.\nprofessor c: Yeah, it sounds like it, doesn't it,\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: yeah.\ngrad f: It's a lot like it.\ngrad e: And then and then here you \ngrad f: Um.\ngrad e: On this scale, you have it either be ego or allocentric.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And that's  that's basically it. So. Egocentric two - point, egocentric three - point, or you can have allocentric.\ngrad b: Oh, OK.\ngrad e: So, \" as seen from the church, the town hall is right of that um, fire station \". aa - huh It's hardly ever used but it's w\nphd a: I 'd love to see it if you if you have a copy kind of. Uh.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah. I see this is this is getting into Ami's thing.\nphd a: Here\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: He's he's very interested in that.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: So.\ngrad b: Me too.\nprofessor c: Uh. Yeah. Well, why don't you just put it on the web page? There's this EDU Right?\ngrad e: Yeah it's or or just Yeah.\nprofessor c: Or a link to it.\ngrad e: It's also all on my my home page at EML. It's called \" An Anatomy of a Spatial Description \".\nprofessor c: Just\ngrad e: But I 'll send that link.\nphd a: OK, great.\nprofessor c: Maybe just put a link on. Yeah.\ngrad e: Yep.\nprofessor c: By the way, there something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so, is apparently, there are separate brain areas for things within reach, and things that are out of reach.\ngrad e: Yep.\ngrad b: Huh.\nprofessor c: So there's there's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know, near and far, or yon and and so forth.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So this is all This is There's this linguistic facts. But apparently, the Uh. Here's the way the findings go. That, you know they do MRI, and and if you 're uh got something within reach then there's one of your areas lights up, and if something's out of reach uh a different one. But here's the the amazing result, um, they say. You get someone with a with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things. So the s typical task is subdivision. So there's a a line on the wall over there, and you give them a laser pointer, and you say, \" Where's the midpoint? \" And they do fine. If you give them the line, and they have to touch it, they can't. There's just that part of the brain isn't functioning, so they can't do that. Here's the real experiment. The same thing on the wall, you give them a laser, \" where is it? \",\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: they do it. Give them a stick, long stick, and say \" do it \", they can't do it. So there's a remapping of distant space into nearby space.\nphd a: Right. So they doubled the the end the end of this \ngrad f: Because it's within reach now?\ngrad b: Yeah,\nprofessor c: It's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh, mechanism.\ngrad b: yeah.\ngrad f: Oh. Wow.\ngrad b: Circuits.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor c: So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference.\ngrad b: That's cool.\nprofessor c: And so this doe This is, uh First of all, it explains something that I 've always wondered about and I 'll do this this test on you guys as well. So. Uh. How - I have had an experience, not often, but a certain number of times, when, for example, I 'm working with a tool, a screwdriver or something, for a long time, I start feeling the tip directly. Not indirectly, but you actually can feel the tip.\ngrad b: Yeah yeah.\nprofessor c: And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that, claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of, physical sensation, of the end affector.\ngrad b: Yeah. What's going on at the end of the tool,\nphd a: The ext the the The extension,\ngrad b: yeah.\nprofessor c: Huh?\ngrad b: What's going on at the end of the tool, or whatever.\nprofessor c: Yeah, within \nphd a: right.\nprofessor c: Huh?\nphd a: The extension of of your hand, right.\nprofessor c: Yeah, right. Have you hav y h had this?\nphd a: The I I think so. I mean i i it's not exactly the th same thing, but but s it it it's getting close to that.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad f: W what does it feel like?\nprofessor c: Oh i it feels like your as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool, and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and and you deal directly with it.\nphd a: I once I I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it's dangerous to get close? So you can insert your hand something\ngrad b: Oh, OK.\nprofessor c: Right, yeah yeah yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: and there's a correspondence between \nprofessor c: Yeah.\nphd a: So I played with it. After a while, you don't feel the difference anymore. I I mean it's kind of \ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Yeah, right.\nphd a: Very kind of you stop back and suddenly it goes away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it, but yeah.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Right, Yeah, so anyway, so So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff.\ngrad b: That's cool.\nprofessor c: And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh, make this distinction. Of course there are behavioral differences too. Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference. And i this is, um So. In addition to the e\ngrad e: This is more proximal - distal.\nprofessor c: Yeah uh exactly. So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place, you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded. S\ngrad e: Well, Dan Montello sort of, he he does the uh uh th the cognitive map world, down in Santa Barbara. And he he always talks about these He he already well i probably most likely without knowing this this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Well there's there's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this, but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw. Anyway yeah, so we 'll we 'll look at this. And. So, all of these issues now are now starting to come up. So, now we 're now done with demos. We 're starting to do science, right? And so these issues about uh, reference, and spatial reference, discourse reference, uh - uh - uh - uh all this sort of stuff, uh, deixis which is part of what you were talking about,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: um So, all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now. So we gotta do all this. So there's that. And then there's also a set of system things that come up. So \" OK, we 're not using their system. That means we need our system. \"\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Right?\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: It it follows. And so, uh, in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right, and the formalism and stuff, we 're actually gonna build something and uh, Johno is point person on the parser, analyzer, whatever that is, and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um, the grammar stuff.\ngrad b: Alright.\nprofessor c: But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology, so, um And so this is another thing where we 're gonna, you know, have to get involved and make s relatively early I think, make some decisions on uh, \" is there an ontology API that that \" There's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we build the parser and stuff around that, or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on, and if so For example, is there something that we can use there. i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out, for that. Uh, so there are gonna be some some some things like that, which are not science but system. But we aren't gonna ignore those cuz we 're we 're not only going The plan is not only to lay out this thing, but to actually uh build some of it. And how much we build, and and so forth.\ngrad b: I \nprofessor c: Uh. Part of it, if it works right, is wh It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling. So. It's always been out of phase but it now seems that um, there's a good shot at that. So we 've talked about it, and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing,\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: and of course it's only w In both cases it's only one piece of a bigger system.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece.\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor c: It was just this uh construction analyzer. And so we think we think we have a shot at at that.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: So. The for So. To to come full circle on that, this formalization task, OK? is trying to get the formalism into into a shape where it can actually uh\ngrad b: Yeah. Be of use to someone who's trying to do this, right?\nprofessor c: d Well, yeah, where it actually is is covers the whole range of things. And the the the the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do, and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms. It turned out, inherently not to cover the space.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: And it just it was just terribly frustrating for him,\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing.\ngrad b: I see. Right.\nprofessor c: And. Uh. Johno is much more pragmatic.\ngrad b: OK. Good to know.\nprofessor c: Uh. Huh? Is This is true, is it not?\ngrad d: Yes.\nprofessor c: OK. So there's you know sort of, yeah, deep, really deep, emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh, complete.\ngrad b: Oh, OK.\ngrad f: You don't have a hidden purist streak?\ngrad d: Oh no.\nprofessor c: We - well it hasn't it it certainly hasn't been observed, in any case.\ngrad f: OK. Just checking.\ngrad d: No sir.\ngrad b: Alright.\nprofessor c: Um. Now, you do, but that's OK. Uh. So. For for \ngrad b: Cuz I don't have to implement anything.\nprofessor c: Exactly right. Exactly.\ngrad f: I have a problem, then. It's So. Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably.\nphd a: Hmm.\ngrad b: Yeah, right.\nprofessor c: Right. Why a actually, uh, the thing is, you you do but, th the thing you have to im implement is so small that Uh.\ngrad f: Which meeting I 'm in. It's OK to be purist within that context.\nprofessor c: Within that, yeah,\ngrad f: Yes,\nprofessor c: and uh, it's a and still, I think, you know, get something done.\ngrad f: good.\ngrad b: Cool!\nprofessor c: But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work, is real hard.\ngrad f: Yay.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: OK. And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert's gonna pick a piece of this space,\nphd a: It's possible yeah.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: OK, uh, for his absentee thesis. I think you all know that that you can just, in Germany almost just send in your thesis.\ngrad b: Just a drive up. Ca - chuk!\nphd a: Um\nprofessor c: Yeah right.\ngrad b: There you go.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad e: The - th There there's a drive - in thesis uh sh joint over in Saarbruecken.\ngrad b: Exactly. Drive through, yeah.\nprofessor c: It costs a lot. The the amount You put in your credit card and as well. But, uh, But anyway, so, uh, that's um, also gotta be worked out, hopefully over the next few weeks, so that that it becomes clear uh, what piece uh, Robert wants to jump into. And, while we 're at this level, uh, there's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project, either next week or the first of August, depending on the blandishments of Microsoft.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: So, de Uh. And her name is Eva.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: It really is. Nobody believed th th that \ngrad f: Yeah, I thought it had to be a joke, of your part, you know\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: like  \" Johno made it up, I 'm sure. \"\ngrad g: Is this person someone who's in first - year this year,\nprofessor c: No, first year coming.\ngrad g: or\nprofessor c: So, she's she's now out here she's moved, and she 'll be a student as of then.\ngrad g: OK.\nprofessor c: And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff, so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that.\ngrad g: OK.\nprofessor c: Uh.\ngrad e: Document.\ngrad g: Right.\nprofessor c: Uh, against all traditions. And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this. Uh \ngrad f: Someone from the class?\nprofessor c: No, interestingly enough.\ngrad f: We always get these people who are not in the class, who \nprofessor c: Some of th some of them, yeah.\ngrad f: It's interesting.\nprofessor c: So anyway, uh, but uh she's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Uh, so, um, I 've give I 've given her some things to read. So we 'll see how this goes. Oh there's yet another one of the incoming first  incoming first - year graduate students who's expressed interest, so we 'll see how that goes. Um, anyway, so, I think as far as this group goes, um, it's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that, and what are th what are the concepts. We 'll see whether it's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not, I 'm not sure. It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes. S so, we 'll see. And then, Ami, you can decide, you know, how much time you wanna put into it and uh, it it's beginning to take shap shape,\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor c: so uh and,\nphd a: Right\nprofessor c: I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the your traditional questions in this light, uh Keith, who's buil building constructions, will be quite happy to uh see what, you know, you envision as the issues and the problems and um, how they might uh get reflected in constructions.\ngrad b: Sure.\nprofessor c: I suspect that's right.\ngrad b: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd a: I I may have to go to Switzerland for in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks, but uh, after that or before that.\nprofessor c: OK, fine. And, um, if it's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center, while you 're in in the neighborhood.\nphd a: Right. Yeah be uh actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva, which I forgot the name of.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Yep. E o do y\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Well, we we 're connected to uh There's a there's a a very significant connection between We 'll we 'll go through this,\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: ICSI and EPFL, which is the, uh It's the Fr Ge - Germany's got two big technical institutes. There's one in in Zurich,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: E T and then there's one, the French speaking one, in Lausanne,\ngrad b: Oh, so in Switzerland.\nprofessor c: OK? which is uh E P\nphd a: Great.\nprofessor c: F L. So find out who they are associated with in Geneva.\nphd a: Right.\nprofessor c: Probably we 're connected to them.\nphd a: Great. I 'll let you know. S I 'll send you email.\nprofessor c: OK. Yeah, and so anyway we c uh We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that. While he's in in uh \ngrad e: Hmm. Uh. I I think the one you you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there, too.\nphd a: Sure, yeah.\nprofessor c: A lot of interest. Actually, either place, DFKI or uh Yeah, so, and and if there is a book, that you 'll be building up some audience for it.\nphd a: Yeah. Right.\nprofessor c: And you 'll get feedback from these guys.\nphd a: Great, yeah.\nprofessor c: Cuz they 've actually these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them. So we 'll set that up.\nphd a: Cool.\nprofessor c: OK. So, uh, unless we wanna start digging into the uh the belief - net and the decisions now, which would be fine, it's probably \ngrad e: I I tho It's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure.\nprofessor c: OK. So, how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal, and partially questions, saying \" here's what we think we understand, here are the things we think we don't understand \". And that we as a group will try to to finish it. What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday.\ngrad g: Sure.\nprofessor c: OK? Uh, \" these are the decisions \" I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information. It's a design problem.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: You know. We \ngrad g: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah. And let's come up with a first cut at what this should look like. And then finish it up.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: Does that so make sense?\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad e: And um, the the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come?\ngrad g: No, I I think I 'll be done everything by this uh by the end of this week.\ngrad e: Same with you? No.\ngrad d: Nnn. This Well, I 've I have projects, but then the my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he's giving us. And he's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Oh. is it a take - home final? Who's doing this?\ngrad d: Yeah. Aikin, Alex, yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah, figured. That would have been i my guess.\ngrad g: Hmm.\nprofessor c: Right. Um, But anyway, yeah.\ngrad b: Pretty soon.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: OK, so I guess that's\ngrad d: So, the seventeenth will definitely be the last day, like it or not for me.\nprofessor c: Right. right. So let's do this, and then we we well there's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking, uh we have a group on the formalization, uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers. So there 're various kinds of uh \ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: Of course, nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people,\ngrad b: Right.\nprofessor c: right? So, um, two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done.\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So we 'll do that. Great. Oh, the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh, Ellen and see what she's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um, an important pa\ngrad b: Yeah. Quite relevant, yeah.\nprofessor c: We we want those,\ngrad b: Yeah, oh yeah.\nprofessor c: right? And we want them formalized and stuff like that.\ngrad b: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So let me let me make a note to do that.\ngrad b: OK. Yeah, I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer,\ngrad d: OK.\nprofessor c: Oh right! Right right right!\ngrad b: so.\nprofessor c: That's great! Yeah, I I Shweta mentioned that, although she said it's a secret.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad d: Hi\ngrad b: Right, no faculty!\nprofessor c: Th - the faculty aren't faculty aren't supposed to know.\ngrad d: Wednesday's much better for me, yeah.\nprofessor c: But um, I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a \ngrad b: Yeah, right. It's as if we didn't tell anyone at all,\ngrad d: Bhaskara.\ngrad b: right.", "en_query": "What was the general discussion of the meeting?", "zh_query": "会议的一般性讨论是什么？", "fr_query": "Quelle était la discussion générale de la réunion ?", "ukr_query": "Якою була загальна дискусія зустрічі?", "en_summary": "The meeting discussed various topics such as data collection and updates on the German parser.

Hi?\nphd b: Blow into it, it works really well.\ngrad f: Channel B.\nprofessor a: People say the strangest things when their microphones are on.\nphd d: Channel four. Test.\nphd c: Uh - oh.\nphd d: OK.\nphd c: Radio four.\ngrad e: Hello?\nprofessor a: So everybody everybody's on?\nphd d: Today's\nprofessor a: Yeah. So y you guys had a a meeting with uh with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss. Um and uh somebody\nphd c: Mmm.\nprofessor a: eh e and uh I guess Chuck you weren't there either, so the uh\nphd b: I was there.\nprofessor a: Oh you were there?\nphd b: With Hynek?\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor a: So everybody knows what happened except me. OK. Maybe somebody should tell me.\nphd c: Oh yeah. Alright. Well. Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week.\nprofessor a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: So. Yeah. About the um, well the downsampling problem.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd c: Uh and about the f the length of the filters and Yeah.\nprofessor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again?\nphd c: So we had \nprofessor a: I forget.\nphd c: So the fact that there there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling. Well.\nprofessor a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that's perhaps not uh the best w m\nprofessor a: Depends what it's frequency characteristic is, yeah.\nphd c: Well. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: So you could do a you could do a stricter one.\nphd d: System on\nprofessor a: Maybe. Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah. So we discussed about this, about the um \nprofessor a: Was there any conclusion about that?\nphd c: Uh \" try it \". Yeah.\nprofessor a: I see.\nphd c: I guess.\nprofessor a: Yeah. So again this is th this is the downsampling uh of the uh the feature vector stream\nphd c: Uh.\nprofessor a: and um Yeah I guess the the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um uh let's see, so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz. Uh. Um.\nphd c: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two. So. Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is?\nphd c: We don't have yet\nprofessor a: Oh OK.\nphd c: um So, yeah.\nprofessor a: OK.\nphd c: We should have a look first at, perhaps, the modulation spectrum.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd c: Um. So there is this, there is the um length of the filters. Um. So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays. Um. We started to work with this.\nprofessor a: Hmm - hmm.\nphd c: Mmm. And the third point um was the um, yeah, the on - line normalization where, well, the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd c: and that's not taken into account right now. Um. Yeah. And there again, yeah. For this, the conclusion of Hynek was, well, \" we can try it but \"\nprofessor a: Uh - huh.\nphd c: Um.\nprofessor a: Try try what?\nphd c: So try to um um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation.\nprofessor a: OK.\nphd c: Mmm. And this we 've not uh worked on this yet. Um, yeah. And so while discussing about these these LDA filters, some i issues appeared, like well, the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it's uh, well, we don't know really what's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency, these filters don't don't really remove a lot. compared to the to the uh standard RASTA filter. Uh and that's probably a reason why, yeah, on - line normalization helps because it it,\nprofessor a: Right.\nphd c: yeah, it removed this mean. Um. Yeah, but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter, I mean, uh the the mean normalization and Yeah. So. Yeah. So basically that was that's all we discussed about. We discussed about good things to do also uh well, generally good stuff to do for the research.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS, so.\nprofessor a: OK.\nphd c: Yeah,\nprofessor a: I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides\nphd c: um.\nprofessor a: cuz because um\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much. And and I don't think anybody is, you know, closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and uh we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves, and they just had hadn't thought of that. So. Uh. I mean it's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue\nphd c: Yeah. Well, but. Yeah. Yeah. Well \nprofessor a: in in uh the other \nphd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really, but\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd c: I guess it's it's also so uh the time constraints. Because, well, we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well, we will do all that's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then, yeah, perhaps they were too short with the time and\nprofessor a: Then they couldn't. I see.\nphd c: uh yeah. But there was also problem perhaps a problem of communication. So, yeah. Now we will try to \nprofessor a: Just talk more.\nphd c: Yeah, slikes and send mails.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd c: u s o o Yeah.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd c: Uh. OK.\nprofessor a: So there's um Alright. Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right? And this machines are busy and you 're busy\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor a: and\nphd c: Basically.\nprofessor a: Yeah. OK. Oh.\nphd c: Um.\nprofessor a: Let's let's, I mean, I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there there will be uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that's probably the best thing to do. And there was that one email that said that it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing, right?\nphd c: Yeah, yeah. So yeah we 're will start to do this also.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd c: Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson Ericsson code.\nphd d: Yeah. We modif\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: And\nphd d: Yeah, I modified it well, modifying I studied Barry's sim code, more or less. to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction. and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd d: But we haven't result until this moment.\nprofessor a: Yeah, sure.\nphd d: But well, we are working in this also\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction, I don't \nprofessor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it's it's just that it's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result?\nphd d: No. No, no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: we have not make the experiment\nprofessor a: Oh. OK.\nphd d: and maybe will be good result or bad result, we don't know.\nprofessor a: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor a: OK. So um I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what's what's what's happening in in other areas like what's what's happening with your investigations about echos and so on.\ngrad f: Oh um Well um I haven't started writing the test yet, I 'm meeting with Adam today\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: um and he's going t show me the scripts he has for um running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Uh I also um haven't got the code yet, I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet. Cuz I looked at uh Avendano's thesis and I don't really understand what he's doing yet but it it it sounded like um the channel normalization part um of his thesis um was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is, a a bit of a rough way um it sounded like he um he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more, I don't really understand what he's doing yet.\nprofessor a: OK. Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again,\nphd d: It's my\nphd c: Oh yeah?\nphd d: I know this is mine here.\nprofessor a: so. OK. Um. The um so you, and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant \ngrad f: Uh I I 'm ho Right. Well or I 'm hoping I 'm hoping Espen will do it.\nprofessor a: Ah! OK.\ngrad f: Um\nprofessor a: F um\ngrad f: u\nprofessor a: Delegate. That's good. It's good to delegate.\ngrad f: I I think he's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it.\nprofessor a: Great. Great. Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation. Um. One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings. So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques. It's not really echo but uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh uh a uh an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech. So. Um what was it, there was there was some some some point where eh uh Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words, which were the background speech on the close close mike.\ngrad f: Hmm.\nphd b: Oh the What we talked about yesterday?\nprofessor a: Yes.\nphd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me,\nprofessor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah.\nphd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words.\nprofessor a: Yeah. Yeah. So they would like clean channels. Uh and for that mmm uh that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out. So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that. So. OK. Right? Um. And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not, but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor a: Uh.\ngrad e: Um. So continuing to um extend\nphd b: What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing? And and S Shawn, yeah. Oh. So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features? I see.\nprofessor a: But that's uh uh all that's is a a certainly relevant uh study and, you know, what are the features that they 're finding. We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor a: uh what are the variables, what we 're calling this one, what are the variables that they 're found finding useful\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor a: um for \nphd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features.\nprofessor a: Right. And that's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what, I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying, do you ha still have that? Yeah.\ngrad e: Oh yeah.\nprofessor a: There's those that uh yeah, some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on uh what \" good features \" are and \nphd b: What does what did um Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant uh detector, right? How did he H how did he do that? Wh - what was his detector? Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Oh, OK. Mm - hmm. So how did he combine all these features? What what r mmm classifier did he Hmm. Oh right. You were talking about that, yeah. I see.\nprofessor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from. So I mean, there's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something, you know, more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation. But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database? This is the \nphd b: Hmm!\nprofessor a: And then tell them to talk naturally? Yeah, yeah.\nphd b: Pierced tongues and Yeah. You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice. Weld it. Zzz.\nprofessor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could, you know you know have have, you know, reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements.\nphd b: Yeah. I That's right. You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know, transmitters in them and things\nprofessor a: Yeah. Yeah, be cool and help science.\nphd b: and Yeah.\nprofessor a: OK.\nphd b: Hmm! There's a bunch of data that l around, that people have done studies like that w way way back right? I mean I can't remember where uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah. I remember there was this guy at A T - andT, Randolph? or r What was his name? Do you remember that guy? Um, researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying, trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features. I can't remember what his name was. Dang. Now I 'll think of it. That's interesting.\nprofessor a: Do you mean eh but you I mean Mar\nphd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using \nprofessor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there, or?\nphd b: Mark Randolph.\nprofessor a: Yeah he's he's he's at Motorola now.\nphd b: Oh is he?\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd b: Oh OK.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or?\nphd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using, now. But I know I just remember it had to do with you know uh positional parameters\nphd c: What Yeah.\nphd b: and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Yeah. So the only the only uh hesitation I had about it since, I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it's it's continuous variables and a bunch of them. And so\nphd b: Hmm.\nprofessor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels, and just a few of them. And maybe there's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself, whereas um if you did something instead that like um having some manual annotation by uh you know, linguistics students, this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: but the things that you could do, like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: And then there would it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable. Course then, that's the other question is do you want binary variables. So. I mean the other thing you could do is boot trying to to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from uh the uh uh the data itself there, but I I 'm not sure \nphd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering?\nprofessor a: Guess you could, yeah.\nphd b: Bin them up into different categories and \nprofessor a: Yeah. So anyway that's that's uh that's another whole direction that cou could be looked at. Um. Um. I mean in general it's gonna be for new data that you look at, it's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and Um. So.\ngrad e: Right. Right.\nphd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones.\ngrad e: Right.\nphd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: I see.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Yeah. So wh yeah, where this fits into the rest in in my mind, I guess, is that um we 're looking at different ways that we can combine uh different kinds of of rep front - end representations um in order to get robustness under difficult or even, you know, typical conditions. And part of it, this robustness, seems to come from uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it, at least for one one um articulatory feature. The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have, since I mean, one of the things that's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it um the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than um just assuming that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength towards uh it being this phone or that phone. Right? So it so um he's got these um uh uh\nphd b: Hmm.\nprofessor a: he \" AND's \" between these different features. It's a soft \" AND \", I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR's \" across the different soft \" OR's \" across the different uh multi - band channels. And um the weight yeah, the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that's kept uh as a hidden variable, and is learned with EM. Whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nphd b: So he doesn't have \nprofessor a: which means that it's it's uh i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to um uh train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band. You you wanna ignore that band, cuz that's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up. In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting. Uh. Maybe that's not the right thing to do.\nphd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho\ngrad e: F right, and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels.\nprofessor a: Well at the at the tail end, yeah, he has to know what's where it's sonorant. But he's but what he's - but what he's not training up uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\ngrad e: Right. For the full band.\nprofessor a: um I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band? Is it sonorant in that band?\ngrad e: Right.\nprofessor a: Is it sonorant in that band? i It's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant. So\nphd b: Mm - hmm. OK.\nprofessor a: then it comes down to, you know, to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision. And um uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything uh with with uh equal strength.\nphd b: I see.\nprofessor a: And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities, if we had uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can. But um this is something that's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the \nphd b: So where did he get his uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what's sonorant and what's not?\ngrad e: From uh canonical mappings um at first\nphd b: OK.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\ngrad e: and then it's unclear um eh\nphd b: Using TIMIT? or using \ngrad e: using TIMIT\nphd b: Uh - huh.\ngrad e: right, right.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\ngrad e: And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases. Yeah.\nprofessor a: Yeah. I mean we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi, uh so there is some something that's suggested, based on the data but it's it's not I think it s doesn't seem like it's quite the same, cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is, it's that for all all bands.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Well no, that's not quite right, we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did. Um. But it's still not quite the same because then it's it's um setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band. Where he's s this is not a labeling per se. Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target uh uh embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times uh f the forward um do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those. Mmm. Uh what's next?\nphd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with.\nprofessor a: Oh. You 're playing?\nphd b: I um Huh?\nprofessor a: You 're playing?\nphd b: Yes, I 'm playing. Um so I wanted to do this experiment to see um uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things. And so I had this um I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment, this matrix where I would take the um the original um the original system. So there's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again. So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end.\nprofessor a: What which test set was this?\nphd b: This is that I looked at?\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that um that uh Stephane had. So um I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to uh to improve it. So. One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and just looked at, you know, the number of phones in each one of the digits. Um you know, sort of the canonical way of setting up a an HMM system is that you use um three states per phone and um so then the the total number of states for a word would just be, you know, the number of phones times three. And so when I did that for the Italian digits, I got a number of states, ranging on the low end from nine to the high end, eighteen. Um. Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there's an initial null and a final null so when they use uh models that have eighteen states, there 're really sixteen states. They 've got those initial and final null states. And so um their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits, the four and five which um, according to my, you know, sort of off the cuff calculation, should have eighteen states each.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And so they had sixteen. So that's pretty close. Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter. So the majority of them wanna have nine states. And so theirs are s sort of twice as long. So my guess uh And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the well - matched case, and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best. So my guess about what's happening is that you know, if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have, you know, half as much training data for those models. Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states, uh you 've got you know, you 've got the same number of Gaussians, you 've gotta train in each case,\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: but for the shorter words, you know, the total number of frames is actually half as many.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So it could be that, you know, for the short words there's because you have so many states, you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians. So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from.\nprofessor a: Yeah, I mean, it's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word,\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: but.\nphd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll, the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um how these models were coming out, you know, what w when we train up uh th you know, the model for \" one \", which wants to have nine states, you know, what is the uh what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops, look like in in those models? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what's happening, you know, how these models are training up,\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd b: you know, the long ones versus the short ones. I d I did quickly, I did the silence model and and um that's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model's the one that's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits.\nprofessor a: Wow. Lots of silence.\nphd b: Yeah, yeah. And so the S P model, which is what they put in between digits, I I haven't calculated that for that one yet, but um. So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit, SP, digit, SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end. And so.\nprofessor a: Are the SP's optional? I mean skip them?\nphd b: I have to look at that, but I 'm not sure that they are. Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So if it's not optional, you know, it's it's not gonna hurt a whole lot\nprofessor a: I see.\nphd b: and it's tied to the center state of the silence model so it's not its own um It doesn't require its own training data,\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: it just shares that state.\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: So it, I mean, it's pretty good the way that they have it set up, but um i So I wanna play with that a little bit more. I 'm curious about looking at, you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case, and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models, you know, what what's happening.\nprofessor a: Yeah, I mean, I think that uh, as much as you can, it's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Not do anything that's really finely tuned, but just sort of eh you know you t you i z\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with?\nphd b: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: And uh\nphd b: And Hynek, when I wa told him about this, he had an interesting point, and that was th um the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state. So they 're fairly, you know, hefty models. And Hynek was saying that well, probably in a real application, you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated. So in fact what we may want are simpler models.\nprofessor a: Could be.\nphd b: And compare how they perform to that. But you know, it depends on what the actual application is and it's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have.\nprofessor a: Right. And that, I mean, at the moment that's not the limitation, so.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: I mean, I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from. You know, so.\nphd b: Yeah. Right.\nprofessor a: Uh that's another parameter, right? that that maybe, you know, uh you really want three or nine or \nphd b: Yeah, yeah. Well one thing I mean, if I if if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians.\nprofessor a: Right.\nphd b: So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system.\nprofessor a: Yeah. Yeah. But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor a: how much better can you make it? And um since they 're only simple things there's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: um so\nphd b: Right. Right.\nprofessor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K, I think, actually.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Doesn't have to go down.\nphd b: Yeah. I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet,\nprofessor a: Mm - hmm, OK.\nphd b: I was just gonna change the the t\nprofessor a: Yeah, just work with the models, yeah.\nphd b: yeah, just look at the length of the models and just see what happens.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd b: So.\nprofessor a: Cool. OK. So uh what's uh I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and\nphd c: Yeah, I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps. with all these minor things modified. And then do other things, play with the spectral subtraction, and retry the MSG and things like that.\nprofessor a: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah we we have a big list.\nphd c: Big list?\nprofessor a: You have a big list of of things to do. So. Well that's good. I think that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doesn't there's there's go there 'll be standards after that. So.\nphd b: Does anybody know how to um run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output. Is it possible to do that?\ngrad e: I I think uh Mike tried it\nphd b: Yeah?\ngrad e: and he says it's impossible so he went to Octave.\nphd b: Octave.\ngrad e: Octave is the um UNIX clone of of Matlab which you can batch.\nphd b: Ah! OK. Great. Thanks.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nphd b: I was going crazy trying to do that.\nprofessor a: Huh.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nphd c: What is Octave so? It's a free software?\ngrad e: What's that? Uh, Octave?\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah it's it's it's free. I think we have it here r running somewhere.\nphd b: Great!\ngrad e: Yeah.\nphd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab, or?\ngrad e: Um i it's a little behind, it's the same syntax but it's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can you can uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab. Uh Octave doesn't do that yet, so I think you, Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or.\nphd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff\ngrad e: The basic stuff, right.\nphd b: that's perfect.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nphd b: Great!\nprofessor a: OK, guess we 're done.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad f: Well, although by the way.", "en_query": "Summarize the meeting", "zh_query": "总结会议", "fr_query": "Résumer la réunion", "ukr_query": "Підведіть підсумки зустрічі", "en_summary": "The meeting began with the team catching up the professor, who had missed the previous meeting.

{"fname": "academic_dev_1", "dialogue": "professor e: So. OK. Doesn't look like it crashed. That's great.\ngrad g: So I think maybe what's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it's working. And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash. So, I won't do that anymore.\npostdoc b: And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the without having people have to give their names each time?\nphd a: Sounds like an initialization thing.\npostdoc b: I mean it's like you have the So you know that \ngrad g: No.\npostdoc b: I mean, are you going to write down that I sat here?\ngrad g: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down.\npostdoc b: OK.\nphd c: Oh, OK.\ngrad g: So So they should be right with what's on the digit forms. OK, so I 'll go ahead and start with digits. u And I should say that uh, you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly.\nprofessor e: And start by giving the transcript number.\nphd a: Tran\nphd d: Transcript Uh. OK, OK.\nphd a: Oh sorry, go ahead.\nprofessor e: So uh, you see, Don, the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project.\ngrad h: OK.\nprofessor e: It's just uh \ngrad h: Umh.\nprofessor e: Uh, you know, it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have that information.\ngrad g: And I 'm surprised I sort of I 'm surprised I forgot that,\nprofessor e: Yeah, I I 'd I think it's some\ngrad g: but uh I think that would be a good thing to add. After I just printed out a zillion of them.\nprofessor e: Yeah, well, that's Um, so I I do have a a an agenda suggestion. Uh, we I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave. So uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and and uh sort of we have anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later, uh hold them for a bit, and let's talk about the the research - y kind of things. Um, so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a a couple weeks before um uh about the uh the stuff you were doing with with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events, we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by \" events \" but I think, you know, what we had meant by \" events \" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers. But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: like some other noise.\nphd d: Uh - huh. Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yes? You mean that as an event also.\nphd d: To\nprofessor e: So at any rate you were you 've you 've done some work on that\nphd d: right.\nprofessor e: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing. Um, I think especially since you you haven't been in in these meetings for a little bit, maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data, uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that that uh that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some some some um uh work about I I I d I I don't want to try to say cuz I I 'll say it wrong, but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data.\nphd c: Oh. Sure.\nprofessor e: So. So, uh.\ngrad g: You wanna just go around?\nprofessor e: Uh. Well, I don't know if we if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing, I think there's just just a couple a couple people primarily um but um Uh, wh why don't Actually I think that that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you you start with that.\npostdoc b: OK. Shall I shall I just start? OK.\nprofessor e: Yeah, just explain what it was.\npostdoc b: Um, so, uh, he was interested in the question of you know, relating to his to the research he presented recently, um of inference structures, and uh, the need to build in, um, this this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language. And he gave the example in his talk about how um, e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now, but it's something about how um, i \" Joe slipped \" you know, \" John had washed the floor \" or something like that. And I don't have it quite right, but that kind of thing, where you have to draw the inference that, OK, there's this time sequence, but also the the the causal aspects of the uh floor and and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it  These sorts of things. So, I looked through the transcript that we have so far, and um, fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um, one of them was something like uh, during the course of the transcript, um um, w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on, and um, the question was raised \" Well, should we restart the recording at this point? \" And and Dan Ellis said, \" Well, we 're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to \". Now, how would you interpret that without a lot of inference? So, the inferences that are involved are things like, OK, so, how do you interpret \" ahead of the game \"? You know. So it's the it's i What you what you int what you draw you know, the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording,\ngrad g: Hmm, metaphorically.\npostdoc b: that um, i that i we have enough space, and he continues, like \" we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling \". So you have to sort of get the idea that um, \" ahead of the game \" is sp speaking with respect to space limitations, that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space, and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far. But there are a lot of different things like that.\ngrad g: So, do you think his interest is in using this as a data source, or training material, or what?\nprofessor e: Well, I I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him, so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data, uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh, with Jane's help, look into some of the data that we 're already have and see, is there anything to this at all?\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Is there any point which you think that, you know, you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it. Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say \" well, this is just the wrong task for for him to pursue his \"\ngrad g: Wrong, yeah.\nprofessor e: And and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that that you looked at that that it's plausible at least.\npostdoc b: It's possible. Uh, he was he he you know We met and he was gonna go and uh you know, y look through them more systematically\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc b: and then uh meet again.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc b: So it's, you know, not a matter of a \nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc b: But, yeah, I think I think it was optimistic.\nprofessor e: So anyway, that's that's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that, you know, might might might come out from some of this.\nphd c: But he can use text, basically. I mean, he's talking about just using text\npostdoc b: That's his major I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours\nphd c: pretty much, or?\npostdoc b: and that wasn't as directly relevant to what he's doing. He's interested in these these knowledge structures,\nphd c: OK.\nphd d: Yeah, interesting.\npostdoc b: inferences that you draw i from \nprofessor e: I mean, he certainly could use text, but we were in fact looking to see if there is there is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in in in this stuff. So.\ngrad g: And I imagine that transcripts of speech I mean text that is speech probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing. I I don't know whether it would or not, but it seems like it would.\nprofessor e: I don't know, probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was. But.\npostdoc b: Yeah, I don't think I would make that leap, because i in narratives, you know I mean, if you spell out everything in a narrative, it can be really tedious,\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc b: so.\ngrad g: Yeah, I 'm just thinking, you know, when you 're when you 're face to face, you have a lot of backchannel and And \npostdoc b: Oh. That aspect.\ngrad g: Yeah. And so I think it's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it's face to face. I mean, so, if I just read that Dan was saying \" we 're ahead of the game \" in that in that context,\npostdoc b: Well Yeah.\ngrad g: I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else.\npostdoc b: I you know, I I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them.\ngrad g: Uh - huh.\npostdoc b: This this one really does um m make you leap from So he said, you know, \" we 're ahead of the game, w we have built - in downsampling \".\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\npostdoc b: And the inference, i if you had it written down, would be \ngrad g: I guess it would be the same.\npostdoc b: Uh - huh. But there are others that have backchannelling, it's just he was less interested in those.\nphd f: Can I Sorry to interrupt. Um, I f f f I 've @ @ d A minute uh, several minutes ago, I, like, briefly was was not listening and So who is \" he \" in this context?\nphd c: Yeah, there's a lot of pronoun \nphd f: OK. So I was just realizing we 've You guys have been talking about \" he \" um for at least uh, I don't know, three three four minutes without ever mentioning the person's name again.\nphd c: I believe it. Yeah. Actually to make it worse, uh, Morgan uses \" you \" and \" you \"\nphd f: So this is this is this is gonna be a big, big problem if you want to later do uh, you know, indexing, or speech understanding of any sort.\ngrad g: It's in my notes.\nphd c: with gaze and no identification, or I just wrote this down. Yeah, actually. Cuz Morgan will say well, \" you had some ideas \"\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd f: You just wrote this?\nphd c: and he never said Li - He looked \ngrad g: Well, I think he's doing that intentionally,\nphd c: Right, so it's great.\ngrad g: aren't you?\nphd c: So this is really great\nphd f: Right.\nphd c: because the thing is, because he's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation,\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics. Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice.\nprofessor e: Uh - huh. Could be.\npostdoc b: Can we\nprofessor e: Yeah. That would be tou\ngrad g: Oh, that would be interesting.\nphd c: Yeah, so that, I mean, to even know um when \nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah, if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice.\ngrad g: Well, especially with Morgan, with the way we have the microphones arranged. I 'm sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell.\nphd c: Right.\ngrad g: Uh.\npostdoc b: Oh, but you 'd have the \nphd c: Put Morgan always like this\npostdoc b: You 'd have fainter \nphd c: and \npostdoc b: Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here?\nprofessor e: Well, these \ngrad g: Sure, but I think if I 'm talking like this? Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking, now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking, I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference.\nphd c: But you don't have this this problem.\npostdoc b: I see.\nphd c: Morgan is the one who does this most.\ngrad g: So if I 'm talking at you, or I 'm talking at you.\nprofessor e: I probably been affect No, I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about and concerns about \" oh gee is somebody going to say something bad? \" and so on.\ngrad g: Lawyers.\nprofessor e: And so I so I 'm I 'm tending to stay away from people's names even though uh \npostdoc b: I am too.\nphd c: Even though you could pick up later on, just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at.\npostdoc b: I am too.\ngrad g: And we did mention who \" he \" was.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd f: Right, but I missed it.\ngrad g: Early in the conversation.\nphd f: But it was uh \nphd c: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad g: Do Sh - Can I say\nprofessor e: Yeah. No no, there's \nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad g: or or is that just too sensitive?\nprofessor e: No no, it isn't sensitive at all.\npostdoc b: Well \nprofessor e: I was just I was just I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it.\npostdoc b: And in fact, it is it is it is sensitive.\nphd c: No, but that it's interesting.\nprofessor e: It's OK to \npostdoc b: I I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention. I mean, it fits into the m area of the mundane, but they did say You know, I asked her very specifically about this clause of how, um, you know, it says \" no individuals will be identified uh, \" in any publication using the data. \" OK, well, individuals being identified, let's say you have a a snippet that says, \" Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about about this field, but I think he's wrongheaded. \" Now I mean, we 're we 're gonna be careful not to have the \" wrongheaded \" part in there, but but you know, let's say we say, you know, \" Joe used to think so - and - so about this area, in his publication he says that but I think he's changed his mind. \" or whatever. Then the issue of of being able to trace Joe, because we know he's well - known in this field, and all this and and tie it to the speaker, whose name was just mentioned a moment ago, can be sensitive.\nprofessor e: b But I \npostdoc b: So I think it's really really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there's a slanderous aspect to it, then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove?\nprofessor e: Yeah, well, there's that. But I I mean I think also to some extent it's just educating the Human Subjects people, in a way, because there's If uh You know, there's court transcripts, there's there's transcripts of radio shows I mean people say people's names all the time. So I think it it can't be bad to say people's names. It's just that i I mean you 're right that there's more poten If we never say anybody's name, then there's no chance of of of slandering anybody,\nphd c: But, then it won't I mean, if we if we \nprofessor e: but \ngrad g: It's not a meeting.\nphd c: Yeah. I mean we should do whatever's natural in a meeting if if we weren't being recorded.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Right, so I So my behavior is probably not natural.\nphd c: \" If Person X \"\nprofessor e: So.\npostdoc b: Well, my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it, you know.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd f: Well, if you ha since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway, you could make it one of the jobs of the people who do that to mark\ngrad g: Well, we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization.\nphd f: Right.\ngrad g: If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name. And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that.\nprofessor e: Yeah, we really can't. But a actually, I 'm sorry. I really would like to push finish this off.\npostdoc b: I understand. No I just I just was suggesting that it's not a bad policy p potentially.\nprofessor e: So it's \npostdoc b: So, we need to talk about this later.\nprofessor e: Yeah, I di I didn't intend it an a policy though.\npostdoc b: Uh - huh.\nprofessor e: It was it was just it was just unconscious well, semi - conscious behavior. I sorta knew I was doing it but it was \nphd f: Well, I still don't know who \" he \" is.\nprofessor e: I I do I don't remember who \" he \" is.\nphd c: No, you have to say, you still don't know who \" he \" is, with that prosody.\nprofessor e: Ah. Uh, we were talking about Dan at one point and we were talking about Lokendra at another point.\npostdoc b: Yeah, depends on which one you mean.\nprofessor e: And I don't I don't remember which which part.\nphd f: Oh.\nphd c: It's ambiguous, so it's OK.\nprofessor e: Uh, I think \ngrad g: Well, the inference structures was Lokendra.\nphd f: But no. The inference stuff was was was Lokendra.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nphd f: OK. That makes sense, yeah.\nphd c: And the downsampling must have been Dan.\nprofessor e: Um \ngrad g: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Good Yeah.\nphd c: It's an inference.\nprofessor e: Yeah, you could do all these inferences, yeah.\ngrad g: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Um, I I would like to move it into into uh what Jose uh has been doing\npostdoc b: Yeah.\nprofessor e: because he's actually been doing something.\nphd d: Uh - huh. OK.\nprofessor e: So. Right.\nphd f: As opposed to the rest of us.\nphd d: Well - OK. I I remind that me my first objective eh, in the project is to to study difference parameters to to find a a good solution to detect eh, the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded. But eh, tsk, ehhh In that way I I I begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone. And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session and I I have found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events, eh besides the overlapping zones, eh I I I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh, eh, talk eh, eh, clap, eh  I don't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech\nphd a: Nonspeech sounds?\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad g: Oh, I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail. So.\nphd d: Yeah. Eh, I I I do I don't need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic, but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh, I I will find eh, eh, a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh, eh acoustic events, to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh, the false eh hypothesis eh, nnn, which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh I mean pitch eh, eh, difference eh, feature \ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: You know I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there's two there.\ngrad g: So it was \nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: I mean, if it's a tapping sound, you wouldn't necessarily or, you know, something like that, it 'd be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad g: Well You weren't talking about just overlaps\nphd d: Ye\ngrad g: were you? You were just talking about acoustic events.\nphd d: I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general,\ngrad g: Someone starts, someone stops Yeah.\nphd a: Oh.\nphd d: but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone.\ngrad g: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: Eh? n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events.\nprofessor e: How many overlaps were there uh in it? No no, how many of them were the overlaps of speech, though?\nphd d: How many? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session\ngrad g: Oh, God!\nphd d: in five eh in forty - five minutes.\nphd a: Three hundred overlapping speech \nphd d: Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone.\ngrad g: Ugh.\nphd c: Overlapping speech.\nphd d: With the overlapping zone, overlapping speech speech what eh different duration.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Sure.\npostdoc b: Does this? So if you had an overlap involving three people, how many times was that counted?\nphd d: Yeah, three people, two people. Eh, um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background, be\nprofessor e: No no, but I think what she's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking, instead of two, did you call that one event?\nphd d: Oh. Oh. Yeah. I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone. This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event, the overlapping zone, the period where three speaker or eh are talking together.\ngrad g: Well So let's \npostdoc b: For\ngrad g: So let's say me and Jane are talking at the same time, and then Liz starts talking also over all of us. How many events would that be?\nphd d: So - I don't understand.\ngrad g: So, two people are talking, and then a third person starts talking.\nphd d: Yeah?\ngrad g: Is there an event right here?\nphd d: Eh no. No no. For me is the overlapping zone, because because you you have s you have more one eh, more one voice eh, eh produced in a in in a moment.\nprofessor e: I see.\ngrad g: So i if two or more people are talking.\nprofessor e: OK. Yeah. So I think Yeah. We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it.\nphd d: Yeah. If\nprofessor e: So then, in the region between since there there is some continuous region, in between regions where there is only one person speaking.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor e: And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event.\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor e: Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: or are you calling the entire length of it the event?\nphd d: I consider the the, nnn the nnn, nnn eh, the entirety eh, eh, all all the time there were the voice has overlapped.\nprofessor e: OK.\nphd d: This is the idea. But eh I I don't distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker. Uh, I 'm not considering eh the the ehm eh, the fact of eh, eh, for example, what did you say? Eh at first eh, eh two talkers are uh, eh speaking, and eh, eh a third person eh join to to that. For me, it's eh it's eh, all overlap zone, with eh several numbers of speakers is eh, eh the same acoustic event. Wi - but uh, without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together, and the zone with the three speakers.\npostdoc b: That would j just be one.\nphd d: It One. One.\npostdoc b: OK.\nphd d: Eh, with eh, a beginning mark and the ending mark. Because eh for me, is the is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral.\nprofessor e: Got it.\nphd d: I don't mind By the moment, by the moment.\ngrad g: Well, but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two.\nphd d: I I don't Yeah, but eh but eh I have to study. What will happen in a general way,\nprofessor e: Could.\ngrad g: So. You had to start somewhere.\nprofessor e: Yeah. We just w\nphd c: So there's a lot of overlap.\nphd d: I I don't know what eh will will happen with the \ngrad g: Yep.\nphd c: So.\ngrad g: That's a lot of overlap,\nphd d: Yeah?\nprofessor e: So again, that's that's three three hundred in forty - five minutes that are that are speakers, just speakers.\ngrad g: yeah, for forty - five minutes.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor e: Uh - huh. OK. Yeah.\npostdoc b: But a a a th\nprofessor e: So that's about eight per minute.\npostdoc b: But a thousand events in twelve minutes, that's \nphd d: Yeah, but Yeah.\nphd c: But that can include taps.\nphd d: But \nprofessor e: Uh. Yeah.\npostdoc b: Well, but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot.\nphd d: General.\nphd c: Actually \nphd d: I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh, the silent too.\npostdoc b: Silent.\ngrad g: Silence starting or silence ending \nphd d: Yeah, silent, ground to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech.\nphd c: Oh, OK.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Oh.\nphd d: In ge in in in a general point of view.\nphd c: Oh.\nprofessor e: OK, so how many of those thousand were silence?\nphd c: Alright.\nphd d: in the per\nphd f: Not speech not speech or too much speech.\nphd d: Too much speech.\nprofessor e: Right. So how many of those thousand were silence, silent sections?\nphd d: Yeah. Uh silent, I I I I don't I I haven't the eh I I would like to to do a stylistic study\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd d: and give you eh with the report eh from eh the the study from the the the session one session.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd d: And I I found that eh another thing. When eh eh I w I I was eh look at eh nnn, the difference speech file, um, for example, eh if eh we use the ehm the mixed file, to to transcribe, the the events and the words, I I saw that eh the eh speech signal, collected by the eh this kind of mike eh of this kind of mike, eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh, we eh collected by headphone.\ngrad g: Yep.\nphd d: And It's right.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd d: But the problem is the following. The the the I I I knew that eh the signal eh, eh would be different, but eh the the problem is eh, eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file. And so if when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn the mixed file, it's possible eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system, it's possible you eh in the eh i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike, to eh to nnn to do the experiments with the the system,\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd d: its possible to evaluate eh, eh or to consider eh acoustic events that which you marked eh in the mixed file, but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the by the mike.\ngrad g: Right. The the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription, not speech event transcription.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's a good idea. It's a good idea I think.\ngrad g: So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription, that the mixed signals here \nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad g: I mean, if I 'm tapping on the table, you it's not gonna show up on any of the mikes, but it's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So and I I I say eh that eh, eh, or this eh only because eh I c I I in my opinion, it's necessary to eh to eh to put the transcription on the speech file, collected by the objective signal.\ngrad g: So.\nphd d: I mean the the the signal collected by the eh, the real mike in the future, in the prototype to to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm. The the the far - field, yeah.\nphd d: you have to to analyze you have to to process. Because I I found a difference.\nprofessor e: Yeah, well, just I mean, just in that that one s ten second, or whatever it was, example that Adam had that that we we passed on to others a few months ago, there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and and uh, in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap, and in the distant mike you could. So yeah, it's clear that if you wanna study if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap, it's probably better to use a distant mike.\nphd f: That's good.\nprofessor e: On the other hand, there's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes,\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes, time aligned?\nprofessor e: so it's \ngrad g: If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes, you would hear Jane interrupting me, but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling. And so if you 're interested in \nphd c: I I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech, that's not a problem,\nprofessor e: Some of it's masking masked.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd a: Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you?\nprofessor e: Right.\nphd c: right?\ngrad g: Right.\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad g: Although the other issue is that the mixed close - talking mikes I mean, I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that.\nphd c: But it's known.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: I mean, the normalization you do is over the whole conversation\ngrad g: Yep.\nphd c: isn't it, over the whole meeting.\ngrad g: Right. Yep.\nphd c: So if you wanted to study people overlapping people, that's not a problem.\nphd d: I I I think eh I saw the nnn the eh but eh I eh I have eh any results. I I I saw the the speech file collected by eh the fet mike, and eh eh signal eh to eh to noise eh relation is eh low. It's low.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: It's very low. You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone.\ngrad g: Yep.\nphd d: And I I found that nnn that eh, ehm, pr probably,\ngrad g: Did Did you\nphd d: I 'm not sure eh by the moment, but it's it's probably that eh a lot of eh, eh for example, in the overlapping zone, on eh in in several eh parts of the files where you you can find eh, eh eh, smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the in the meeting,\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nphd d: it's probably in in that eh in in those files you you can not find you can not process because eh it's confused with with noise.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\nphd d: And there are a lot of I think. But I have to study with more detail. But eh my idea is to to process only nnn, this eh nnn, this kind of s of eh speech. Because I think it's more realistic. I 'm not sure it's a good idea, but eh \nprofessor e: No i\ngrad g: Well, it's more realistic but it 'll it 'll be a lot harder.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Well, it 'd be hard, but on the other hand as you point out, if your if i if if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people people's speech, you will you will get that somewhat better.\nphd d: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor e: Um, Are you making any use uh you were you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed.\nphd d: With By Jane.\nprofessor e: Does it uh Yes.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Now um did you make any use of that? See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed.\nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor e: Do you \nphd d: The the transcription by Jane, t eh i eh, I I I want to use to to nnn, eh to put i i it's a reference for me. But eh the transcription eh for example, I I don't I I 'm not interested in the in the in the words, transcription words, eh transcribed eh eh in eh follow in the in the in the speech file, but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker, in the in the meeting, um eh she she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh there is an overlapping zone. But eh there isn't any any mark, time temporal mark, to to c eh to mmm e - heh, to label the beginning and the end of the of the\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm. OK. Right, so she is \nphd d: ta I 'm I I I think eh we need this information to\nprofessor e: Right. So the twelve you you it took you twelve hours of course this included maybe some some time where you were learning about what what you wanted to do, but but uh, it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes, your\ngrad g: Twelve minutes.\nphd d: Twelve minutes.\nprofessor e: s Twelve minutes!\nphd d: Twelve minutes. Twelve.\nprofessor e: I thought you did forty - five minutes of \nphd d: No, forty - five minutes is the is the session, all the session.\npostdoc b: Oh.\nprofessor e: Oh, you haven't done the whole session.\nphd d: Yeah, all is the the session.\nprofessor e: This is just twelve minutes.\nphd d: Tw - twelve hours of work to to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part of f\nprofessor e: Oh. So let me back up again. So the when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps,\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: that's in twelve minutes?\nphd d: No no no. I I consider all the all the session because eh I I count the nnn the nnn the overlappings marked by by Jane,\nprofessor e: Oh, OK.\npostdoc b: Oh, I see.\nphd d: in in in in the fin in in the forty - five minutes.\nprofessor e: OK. So it's three hundred in forty - five minutes, but you have you have time uh, uh marked twelve minute the the the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Got it.\nphd f: So, can I ask can I ask whether you found uh, you know, how accurate uh Jane's uh uh labels were as far as \ngrad g: Well, not just the overlaps, everything.\nphd f: you know, did she miss some overlaps? or did she n?\nphd d: But, by by the moment, I I don't compare, my my temporal mark with eh Jane, but eh I I want to do it. Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the in the marks, I and if I I compare with eh Jane, it's probably I I I can correct and and and to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad g: Well, also Jane Jane was doing word level.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad g: So we weren't concerned with exactly when an overlap started and stopped.\nphd f: Right. Right.\nphd c: Well, not only a word level, but actually\nphd d: Well \nphd f: I 'm expect I 'm not expecting \nphd d: No, it's \nphd c: I mean, you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption, you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt, or \ngrad g: Right.\nprofessor e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Yep.\npostdoc b: Well \nphd d: Yeah. Yeah.\npostdoc b: Well, yeah, b yeah, I would say time bin. So my my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin, beginning and end point.\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd d: Yeah.\nphd c: Right.\nphd d: Yeah.\npostdoc b: And and sometimes, you know, it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle,\nphd d: Yeah.\npostdoc b: but, yeah, w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that i disrupt that unit in order to have, you know, a the words in the order in which they were spoken, it would have it would have been hard with the interface that we have.\nphd d: Yeah.\npostdoc b: Now, my a Adam's working on a of course, on a revised overlapping interface,\nphd d: Uh - huh.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd d: I I I think It's it's a good eh work,\npostdoc b: but \nphd d: but eh I think we need eh eh more information.\nphd f: No, of course.\npostdoc b: Yeah.\nphd f: I expect you to find more overlaps than than Jane\ngrad g: Always need more for \npostdoc b: Yeah.\nphd d: No, no. I I have to go to \nphd f: because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level.\nphd d: I want eh I wanted to eh compare the the transcription.\nprofessor e: I have \ngrad g: But if it takes sixty to one \nprofessor e: Well, I but I have a suggestion about that. Um, obviously this is very, very time - consuming, and you 're finding lots of things which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting, but in the interests of making progress, uh might I s how how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps?\nphd d: Only.\nprofessor e: Yes.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Do not mark any other events,\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor e: but only mark speaker Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit?\nphd d: OK. OK. I I I I w I I wanted to \nprofessor e: Do y do you think that would speed it up? Uh, speed up your your your marking?\nphd d: nnn, I don't understand very.\nprofessor e: It took you a long time to mark twelve minutes.\nphd d: Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor e: Now, my suggestion was for the other thirty - three \nphd d: On - only to mark only to mark overlapping zone, but \nprofessor e: Yeah, and my question is, if you did that, if you followed my suggestion, would it take much less time?\nphd d: Oh, yeah. Sure.\nprofessor e: Yeah OK.\nphd d: Yeah sure.\nprofessor e: Then I think it's a good idea.\nphd d: Sure sure.\nprofessor e: Then I think it's a good idea, because it\nphd d: Sure, because I I need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that. Yeah.\nprofessor e: Yeah, I mean, we we know that there's noise.\ngrad g: And\nphd d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor e: There's there's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth, and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: and and something in between with paper rustling. We know that all that's there and it's a g worthwhile thing to study, but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Whereas th i I would think that uh you we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking.\nphd d: Uh - huh. OK. OK.\nprofessor e: So. Then you can get the Cuz you need If it's three hundred uh i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: And and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of of what's going on, much less any kind of reasonable statistics.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd c: Now, why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the \ngrad g: Well, that's That's what I was gonna bring up.\nphd c: I mean, you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand,\nprofessor e: Um, OK, yeah. So let's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation.\nphd c: right? I 'm sorry.\nprofessor e: So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy, such as the energy in the LPC residuals, such as I mean there's a bunch of things I mean, increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. In the far - field mike.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: Oh, OK.\nprofessor e: Um, and uh, it's not obvious, I mean, you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time. But when you start going past that and trying to do better, it's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the you know, the right detector. So the idea is to have some ground truth first. And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say \" OK this, i you know, it's it's really here \".\nphd a: But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts?\nphd c: What I mean is get it from the close - talking mikes.\nprofessor e: Uh, yeah.\nphd c: A or ge get a first pass from those,\nprofessor e: We t we t w we t we talked about that.\nphd c: and then go through sort of It 'd be a lot faster probably to \nphd f: And you can \ngrad g: Yeah, that's his, uh \nprofessor e: We we we talked about that. s But so it's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is,\nphd c: Yeah, I just \nprofessor e: the idea was, i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway, and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful,\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor e: and we could Uh it's a question of what you bootstrap from. You know, do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better, or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements, uh from the close - talking mike. I mean, even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time.\nphd c: Well, that's what I wonder, because um or how bad it is,\nprofessor e: Well\nphd c: be um, because that would be interesting\ngrad g: I 'm working on a program to do that, and \nphd c: especially because the bottleneck is the transcription. Right? I mean, we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for. We have the audio data, we have the close - talking mike,\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: so I mean it seems like one kind of project that's not perfect, but um, that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is, you know, if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech,\nprofessor e: Right, we discussed that.\nphd c: you know, how can we detect that from a far - field?\ngrad g: And \npostdoc b: Oh.\ngrad g: I 've I 've written a program to do that,\nphd c: OK, I 'm sorry I missed the \ngrad g: and it, uh \nprofessor e: It's OK.\ngrad g: and so but it's it's doing something very, very simple. It just takes a threshold, based on on the volume,\nphd c: Uh - huh.\nphd f: Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand.\nphd c: Right, by hand. Yeah.\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad g: um, and then it does a median filter, and then it looks for runs. And, it seems to work, I 've I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters, to get it to actually generate something, and I haven't I don't what I 'm working on was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have, into Transcriber. And so I told I said it would take about a day. I 've worked on it for about half a day,\ngrad h: I have to go.\ngrad g: so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with.\nphd c: OK.\nprofessor e: See, this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working, because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this, and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided,\nphd c: Right. I 'm sorry. I just \nprofessor e: but I couldn't remember all of it.\nphd c: It\nprofessor e: So, I think it was partly that, you know, give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like, partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against, you know, when when he he gets his thing going,\ngrad g: But \nprofessor e: uh, and \nphd c: Well, it's definitely good to have somebody look at it. I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know, the amount of \npostdoc b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: That was that was exactly the notion that that that we discussed.\nphd c: OK.\ngrad g: Thanks.\npostdoc b: Another thing we discussed was um that \nphd c: It looks good.\nprofessor e: So.\nphd c: I 'll be in touch. Thanks.\nprofessor e: S See ya. Yeah.\npostdoc b: Was that um there m there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written, that uh handle bleedthrough, I mean cuz you have this this close you have contamination from other people who speak loudly.\ngrad g: Yeah, and I haven't tried using that. It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that. It's a cross - correlation filter. So I I haven't tried that, but that If It it might be something it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little.\npostdoc b: So, some thought of maybe having Yeah, having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours.\ngrad g: Exactly. Yep.\nprofessor e: But but that's a refinement\npostdoc b: That's what we were discussing.\nprofessor e: and I think we wanna see try the simple thing first, cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first.\ngrad g: Yep.\nprofessor e: But uh, having having somebody have some experience, again, with with uh with marking it from a human standpoint, we 're I mean, I don't expect Jose to to do it for uh f fifty hours of  of speech, but I mean we  if uh if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it, say, for forty - five minutes, then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it.\nphd d: Yeah. Sure. Sure.\nprofessor e: And when when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different.\nphd c: Oh yeah, definitely.\nphd a: You know, I did I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs, and it works pretty well. I mean, i almost exactly what you described, an energy detector with a median filter, you look for runs. And uh, you know, you can \ngrad g: It seemed like the right thing to do.\nphd a: Yeah. I mean, you you can get y I mean, you get them pretty close.\ngrad g: That was with zero literature search.\nphd a: And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to to do it.\ngrad g: That's good validation.\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc b: Is this proprietary?\nphd a: Uh. No. No.\ngrad g: Yeah, do you have a patent on it?\nphd a: It was when I was working for the government.\nprofessor e: Oh, then everybody owns it. It's the people.\npostdoc b: Well, I mean, is this something that we could just co - opt, or is it?\nphd a: Nah.\npostdoc b: No. OK.\nprofessor e: Well, i i i he's pretty close, anyway. I think I think it's \nphd a: Yeah, he's it it doesn't take a long time.\npostdoc b: Right. I just thought if it was tried and true, then  and he's gone through additional levels of of development.\ngrad g: Just output. Although if you if you have some parameters like what's a good window size for the median filter \nphd a: Oh! I have to remember. I 'll think about it, and try to remember.\nphd f: And it might be different for government people.\ngrad g: That's alright.\nprofessor e: Yeah, good enough for government work, as they say.\nphd c: They they \nphd a: Di - dif different different bandwidth.\nphd f: They\ngrad g: I was doing pretty short, you know, tenth of a second, sorts of numbers.\nphd f: OK.\nprofessor e: Uh, I don't know, it if if we want to uh So, uh, maybe we should move on to other other things in limited time.\npostdoc b: Can I ask one question about his statistics? So so in the tw twelve minutes, um, if we took three hundred and divided it by four, which is about the length of twelve minutes, i Um, I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc b: Did you find uh more than seventy - five overlaps in that period, or?\nphd d: More than?\npostdoc b: More than How many overlaps in your twelve minutes?\nphd d: How many? Eh, not @ @ I Onl - only I I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd d: but eh I I don't co eh I don't count eh the the overlap.\npostdoc b: The overlaps. OK.\nphd d: I consider I I The the nnn The the three hundred is eh considered only you your transcription. I have to to finish transcribing. So.\ngrad g: I b I bet they 're more, because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than than sort of the middle.\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad g: Middle or end.\npostdoc b: I 'm not sure.\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad g: Because i we 're we 're dealing with the Uh, in the early meetings, we 're recording while we 're saying who's talking on what microphone, and things like that,\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad g: and that seems to be a lot of overlap.\npostdoc b: I think it's an empirical question.\nphd d: Yeah.\npostdoc b: I think we could find that out.\nphd d: Yeah.\ngrad g: Yep.\npostdoc b: I 'm I 'm not sure that the beginning had more.\nprofessor e: So so I was gonna ask, I guess about any any other things that that that either of you wanted to talk about, especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes, that that you wanna go with.\nphd c: Can I just ask about the data, like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data, just cuz I 'm I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording\nprofessor e: Right so there's this this There's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed.\nphd c: and \nprofessor e: That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point. Then there's s a larger piece that's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM. Right? And then we don't know.\nphd c: How many meetings is that? Like how many \ngrad g: What's that?\nprofessor e: That was about ten hours, and there was about \nphd c: t ten It's like ten meetings or something? Uh - huh.\ngrad g: Yeah, something like that. And then then we\nphd a: Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM?\nphd c: And \nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad g: Well, I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files.\nprofessor e: Oh. Oh, that's right, that had those have not been sent.\nphd a: H how many total have we recorded now, altogether?\nprofessor e: We 're saying about twelve hours.\ngrad g: About twelve by now. Twelve or thirteen.\nphd c: Uh - huh. And we 're recording only this meeting, like continuously we 're only recording this one now? or?\nprofessor e: No. No, so the the that's the that's the biggest one uh, chunk so far,\ngrad g: Nope.\nphd a: It was the morning one.\nphd c: OK.\nprofessor e: but there's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys.\ngrad g: Jerry.\nphd c: Do they meet every week,\nprofessor e: And then there \nphd c: or every \nprofessor e: Uh, they do. w w And we talked to them about recording some more and we 're going to, uh, we 've started having a morning meeting, today uh i starting a w a week or two ago, on the uh front - end issues, and we 're recording those, uh there's a network services and applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded,\nphd c: Great.\nprofessor e: and we 're gonna start recording them. They 're They meet on Tuesdays. We 're gonna start recording them next week. So actually, we 're gonna h start having a a pretty significant chunk and so, you know, Adam's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy, and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff things like that, now that uh the things are starting to happen. So right now, yeah, I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings, but there are scattered other meetings in it and that that amount is gonna grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately i if we 're if we collect fifty or sixty hours, the meeting meetings it will probably be, you know, twenty or thirty percent of it, not not not eighty or ninety. But.\nphd c: So there's probably there's three to four a week,\ngrad g: That's what we 're aiming for.\nphd c: that we 're aiming for.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: And they 're each about an hour or something.\nprofessor e: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad g: Although Yeah. We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not.\nphd c: So OK.\nprofessor e: Yeah and th the the other thing is I 'm not pos I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times, that I really don't know maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty, but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits.\ngrad g: Right.\nprofessor e: Because it's just an added bunch of weird stuff.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: And, you know, we we h we 're highly motivated. Uh in fact, the morning group is really motivated cuz they 're working on connected digits, so it's \ngrad g: Actually that's something I wanted to ask, is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad g: We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those.\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\ngrad g: And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance. But I haven't been ru I haven't been doing that. Um, if I did that, is someone gonna be working on it?\nprofessor e: Uh, yeah, I I think definitely s so Absolutely.\ngrad g: I mean, is it something of interest?\nprofessor e: Yeah, whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that.\ngrad g: OK. I mean, I I 'm I 'm interested in it, I just don't have time to do it now.\nphd f: I was these meetings I 'm sure someone thought of this, but these this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation.\ngrad g: So\nphd f: Um.\ngrad g: Yep. Yep.\nphd c: Actually I have o\ngrad g: I I would really like someone to do adaptation.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: So if we got someone interested in that, I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder.\nprofessor e: Well I mean, one of the things I wanted to do, uh, that I I talked to to Don about, is one of the possible things he could do or m also, we could have someone else do it, is to do block echo cancellation,\ngrad g: Since it's the same people over and over.\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: to try to get rid of some of the effects of the the the far - field effects. Um, I mean we have the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: because people move around, and uh, if if it's if it's uh not a simple echo, like a cross - talk kind of echo, but it's actually room acoustics, it's it's it's you can't really do inversion,\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something It may you Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we 've taken is more \" lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth, that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal \".\nphd f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Uh, that's the party line. But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always, you know, sort of dangerous. It's good good to sort of test them, actually. And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do. So that's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point, just take these digits, take the far - field mike signal, and the close uh mike signal, and apply really good echo cancellation. Um, there was a have been some nice talks recently by by Lucent on on their b\nphd f: Hmm.\nprofessor e: the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me, uh you know, trying and change it sample by sample, but you have some reasonable sized blocks. And um, you know, th\nphd a: W what is the um the artifact you try to you 're trying to get rid of when you do that?\nphd f: Ciao.\nprofessor e: Uh so it's it you have a a direct uh Uh, what's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter, that would um \nphd f: I 'm signing off.\nprofessor e: Yeah. that would subtract off the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant. You know, so so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation Yeah, so you Given that um Yeah, so you 're trying to So you 'd There's a a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there's a time delay there, and after the time delay, there's these various reflections. And if you figure out well what's the there's a a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off uh different uh different reflections. Right? So let's take the simple case where you just had you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there's a there's an echo. It comes back. And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo.\nphd a: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those. Uh, just the raw data, you would you might hear kind of an echo? And and then this noise cancellation would get\nprofessor e: Well, I 'm I 'm I 'm saying That's a simplified version of what's really happening. What's really happening is Well, when I 'm talking to you right now, you 're getting the direct sound from my speech, but you 're also getting, uh, the indirect sound that's bounced around the room a number of times. OK? So now, if you um try to r you To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons, but I but not to try to completely remove it, that is, invert the the room response, but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos. Um, a number of people have done this so that, say, if you 're talking to a speakerphone, uh it makes it more like it would be, if you were talking right up to it. So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach. You say I I I want to use this uh this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos. So you construct a filter, and you have this this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh gets subtracted off from the original speech. Then you try to you try to minimize the energy in some sense. And so um uh with some constraints.\nphd a: Kind of a clean up thing, that \nprofessor e: It's a clean up thing. Right.\nphd a: OK.\nprofessor e: So, echo cancelling is is, you know, commonly done in telephony, and and and it's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if, you know, you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike.\nphd a: When uh, I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone, they had a um some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me, it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise. And then it was uh And then it would come on and it was very clear,\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd a: you know.\nprofessor e: Right. So it's taking samples, it's doing adaptation, it's adjusting weights, and then it's getting the sum. So um, uh anyway that's that's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with. I think that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with, and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything. Uh. Um\npostdoc b: Is Brian Kingsbury's work related to that, or is it a different type of reverberation?\nprofessor e: Brian's Kingsbury's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma. Right? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \", which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want. We want something more flexible, uh i i where people might change their position, and there might be, you know There's also um oh yeah, noise. So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise. It's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays, Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos. But um if there's noise, then the very signal that it's looking at is corrupted so that it's decision about what the right you know, right right uh delays are is, uh is right delayed signal is is is uh is incorrect. And so, in a noisy situation, um, also in a in a situation that's very reverberant  with long reverberation times and really long delays, it's it's sort of typically impractical. So for those kind of reasons, and also a a c a complete inversion, if you actually I mentioned that it's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics. Um, that's difficult because um often times the the um the system transfer function is such that when it's inverted you get something that's unstable, and so, if you you do your estimate of what the system is, and then you try to invert it, you get a filter that actually uh, you know, rings, and and uh goes to infinity. So it's so there's there's there's that sort of technical reason, and the fact that things move, and there's air currents I mean there's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it's not really practical. So for all those kinds of reasons, uh we we we sort of um, concluded we didn't want to in do inversion, and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation, which isn't really inversion, and um we decided to do this approach of taking uh, just picking uh features, which were uh will give you more something that was more stable, in the presence of, or absence of, room reverberation, and that's what Brian was trying to do. So, um, let me just say a couple things that I was I was gonna bring up. Uh. Let's see. I guess you you actually already said this thing about the uh about the consent forms, which was that we now don't have to So this was the human subjects folks who said this, or that that?\npostdoc b: The a apparently I mean, we 're gonna do a revised form, of course. Um but once a person has signed it once, then that's valid for a certain number of meetings. She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form. I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say. So I think from a s practical standpoint, maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings, or something. It won't be that many people who do it that often, but um just, you know, so long as they don't forget that they 've done it, I guess.\nprofessor e: OK. Um, back on the data thing, so there's this sort of one hour, ten hour, a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have. We have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed, we have we have twelve hours that's recorded but not transcribed, and at the rate we 're going, uh by the end of the semester we 'll have, I don't know, forty or fifty or something, if we if this really uh Well, do we have that much?\nphd c: Not really. It's three to four per week.\nprofessor e: Let's see, we have \nphd c: So that's what You know, that \nprofessor e: uh eight weeks, uh is \nphd c: So that's not a lot of hours.\nprofessor e: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four, so that's Yeah, so like thirty thirty hours?\nphd a: Three Three hours.\nphd c: Yeah. I mean, is there I know this sounds tough but we 've got the room set up. Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well, similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes. There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting, that don't require any transcription. So what are the patterns, the energy patterns over the meeting? And I 'm really interested in this but we don't have a whole lot of data. So I was thinking, you know, we 've got the room set up and you can always think of, also for political reasons, if ICSI collected you know, two hundred hours, that looks different than forty hours, even if we don't transcribe it ourselves,\nprofessor e: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester.\nphd c: so \nprofessor e: Right? So, I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months, we are gonna have more like a hundred hours.\nphd c: I mean, is there Are there any other meetings here that we can record, especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci I mean, that are less well I don't uh, that have some more emotional aspects to them, or strong \ngrad g: We had some good ones earlier.\nphd c: There's laughter, um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings, maybe with manager types, or \ngrad g: I think it's hard to record those.\nphd c: To be allowed to record them?\npostdoc b: It's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards.\nphd c: OK.\nprofessor e: Yeah, people will get \npostdoc b: But I but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea.\nphd c: OK. Well, if there is, anyway.\nprofessor e: Yeah, I was gonna mention that.\ngrad g: Oh, that's a good idea. That's That would be a good match.\nprofessor e: Yeah. So Yeah. So I I uh, I I 'd mentioned to Adam, and that was another thing I was gonna talk uh, mention to them before  that uh there's uh It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media. Because, you know, we had talked before about the problem about using found data, that that uh it's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it's typically one microphone, in a, uh, uh or and and so it doesn't really give us the the the uh characteristics we want. Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can. But um, it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" hey you have this panel show, or this you know, this discussion show, and um can you record multi - channel? \" And uh they may be willing to record it uh with \nphd c: With lapel mikes or something?\nprofessor e: Well, they probably already use lapel, but they might be able to have it it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant.\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor e: It wouldn't be exactly this setup, but it would be that sort of thing, and what we were gonna get from UW, you know, assuming they they they start recording, isn't als also is not going to be this exact setup.\nphd c: Right. No, I think that 'd be great, if we can get more data.\nprofessor e: So, I I I I was thinking of looking into that. the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion, in fact, is that it's even possible, since of course, many radio shows are not live, uh that we could invite them to have like some of their  record some of their shows here.\npostdoc b: Wow!\nphd c: Well Or The thing is, they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean, they 're on the radio,\ngrad g: Right, as we are.\nphd c: right? So. Um, I think that 'd be fantastic\nprofessor e: Right.\nphd c: cuz those kinds of panels and Those have interesting\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: Th - that's an a side of style a style that we 're not collecting here, so it 'd be great.\nprofessor e: And and the I mean, the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from I 'll I 'll talk to you more about it later is that is that there's there's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably, uh related to, you know, legal issues and and permissions and all that. I mean, they already do what they do do whatever they do. So it's uh, it's So it's so it's another source. So I think it's something we should look into, you know, we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um and maybe we have this other source. But yeah I think that it's not unreasonable to aim at getting, you know, significantly in excess of a hundred hours. I mean, that was sort of our goal. The thing was, I was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect, you know, thirty to fifty hours. And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester. And if we continue to collect some next semester, I think we should, uh \nphd c: Right. Yeah I was mostly trying to think, \" OK, if you start a project, within say a month, you know, how much data do you have to work with. And you you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your your data for awhile so um right now and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right? Do Oh, do we now?\nprofessor e: Well, we don't even have it for this f you know, forty - five minutes, that was \nphd c: So um, not complaining, I was just trying to think, you know, what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: and they 're pretty different, because\nprofessor e: Yeah. So I was thinking right now it's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data, you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like,\ngrad g: Right.\nphd c: um Right. Right, right.\nprofessor e: and and and uh and meanwhile we collect, and it's more like yeah, three months from now, or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things.\nphd c: Cuz I 'm not actually sure, just logistically that I can spend you know, I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early, before there's enough data to make good use of the time. And that's and especially with the student\ngrad g: Right.\nphd c: uh for instance this guy who seems \nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: Uh anyway, I shouldn't say too much, but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring, how much data will I have to work with, with that person. And so it's \nprofessor e: i Yeah, so I would think, exploratory things now. Uh, three months from now Um, I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing, but I think as far as the collection, it doesn't seem to me l like, uh, unreasonable to say that uh in January, you know, ro roughly uh which is roughly three months from now, we should have at least something like, you know, twenty - five, thirty hours.\nphd c: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that,\nprofessor e: So that's \npostdoc b: Yeah, we need to I think that there's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards,\nphd c: so. I mean, it \npostdoc b: and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions.\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc b: So I think that we 'll need to adjust some And also if we wanna add things like um, well, more refined coding of overlaps, then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through. I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection. There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh, you know, friends, and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to, right?\nprofessor e: If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @ I mean, what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions, but I think if it's a real Why not? Yeah.\nphd c: I mean, I 'm thinking, politically \ngrad g: Stage some political debates.\npostdoc b: You could do this,\nphd c: Well yeah,\npostdoc b: you know. You could.\nphd c: or just if you 're if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't um have them do the digits, or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was, you know, uh, one string of digits, or something, they 'd probably be willing to do.\ngrad g: We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to.\nphd c: Then, having the data is very valuable, cuz I think it's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data, especially with the ITR, if we put in a proposal on it. It 'll just look like ICSI's collected a lot more audio data. Um, whether it's transcribed or not um, is another issue, but there's there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions, or at least that you can start to answer.\npostdoc b: It seems like you could hold some meetings.\ngrad g: Yep.\npostdoc b: You know, you and maybe Adam?\nphd c: So.\npostdoc b: You you could you could maybe hold some additional meetings, if you wanted.\nphd a: Would it help at all I mean, we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings. One is uh um without doing the digits Or, I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits, and everything, and then talk about doing it without digits, what if we had another level, just to collect data, which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff.\nphd c: Need the close - talking mikes.\nphd a: You do, OK.\nphd c: I mean, absolutely,\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd c: yeah. I 'm really scared \ngrad g: It seems like it's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes.\nphd a: I see, OK.\nphd c: Um or at least, like, me personally? I would  I couldn't use that data.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\npostdoc b: I agree. And Mari also,\nphd c: Um.\npostdoc b: we had This came up when she she was here. That's important.\nphd c: So it's a great idea,\nprofessor e: Yeah, I I b By the by the way, I don't think the transcriptions are actually, in the long run, such a big bottleneck.\nphd c: and if it were true than I would just do that, but it's not that bad like the room is not the bottleneck, and we have enough time in the room, it's getting the people to come in and put on the and get the setup going.\nprofessor e: I think the issue is just that we 're we 're blazing that path. Right? And and um d Do you have any idea when when uh the you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them?\ngrad g: Well, I 've been burning two C Ds a day, which is about all I can do with the time I have.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad g: So it 'll be early next week.\nprofessor e: Yeah, OK. So early next week we send it to them, and then then we check with them to see if they 've got it and we we start, you know asking about the timing for it.\ngrad g: Yep.\nprofessor e: So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it, which I think they 're pretty well along on, cuz they were able to read the files and so on.\ngrad g: Yep.\nprofessor e: Right?\ngrad g: Yeah, but \nprofessor e: Well \ngrad g: Yeah, who knows where they are.\nphd a: Have they ever responded to you?\ngrad g: Nope.\nprofessor e: Yeah, but You know, so they they they have you know, they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do,\nphd c: What if \ngrad g: Yeah, you we can't complain.\nprofessor e: right? But they But at any rate, they 'll I I think once they get that sorted out, they 're they 're making cassettes there, then they 're handing it to someone who they who's who is doing it, and uh I think it's not going to be I don't think it's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour, I think. It's not going to be thirty\ngrad g: Yep. I think that's probably true.\nphd c: Really? So it's the amount of \nprofessor e: It's it's just getting it going.\ngrad g: It's pipeline, pipeline issues.\nphd c: Right. What about these lunch meetings \ngrad g: Once the pipeline fills.\nphd c: I mean, I don't know, if there's any way without too much more overhead, even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile, to record you know, two or three more meeting a week, just to have the data, even if they 're um not doing the digits, but they do wear the headphones?\nprofessor e: But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and \nphd c: No, I meant, um, sorry, the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs, maybe they don't wanna be recorded, but \ngrad g: Oh, and we 're just chatting?\nphd c: Just the ch the chatting.\ngrad g: Yeah, we have a lot of those.\nphd c: I actually I actually think that's useful data, um the chatting,\ngrad g: Yeah, the problem with that is I would I think I would feel a little constrained to You know? Uh, some of the meetings \nphd c: but OK. You don't wanna do it, cuz OK.\ngrad g: You know, our \" soccer ball \" meeting?\nphd c: Alright.\ngrad g: I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting.\nphd c: Alright, so I 'll just throw it out there, if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI, um that we could record, I think it would be worth it.\ngrad g: That was hilarious.\nprofessor e: Yeah. Well, we should also check with Mari again, because they because they were really intending, you know, maybe just didn't happen, but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level. So then that would double what we had. Uh. And there's a lot of different meetings at UW uh I mean really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus,\ngrad g: Right.\nprofessor e: so.\nphd a: Is the uh, notion of recording any of Chuck's meetings dead in the water, or is that still a possibility?\nprofessor e: Uh, they seem to have some problems with it. We can we can talk about that later. Um, but, again, Jerry is Jerry's open So I mean, we have two speech meetings, one uh network meeting, uh Jerry was open to it but I I s One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation, there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work, we probably can't do it every week. You know? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel uh are gonna feel a little bit constrained. Now, it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time. And the then so then they can just really sort of try to put the mikes on and then just charge in and \ngrad g: Yep.\nphd c: What if we give people you know, we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something?\npostdoc b: Well, you know, I I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise.\nphd c: OK.\npostdoc b: But I had another question, which is um, you know, in principle, w um, I know that you don't want artificial topics,\nphd c: Alright, alright, alright.\npostdoc b: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial. I mean, we could political discussions, or or something or other,\nphd c: No, definitely.\npostdoc b: and i you know, people who are Because, you know, there's also this constraint. We d it's like, you know, the the uh goldibears goldi goldilocks, it's like you don't want meetings that are too large, but you don't want meetings that are too small.

I mean \ngrad g: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public.\npostdoc b: Yeah.\nphd a: Oh.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: So I I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition\nphd c: Alright, well.\ngrad g: and, they sort of hummed and hawed and said \" well maybe we could have meetings down here \", but then I got email from them that said \" no, we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings. \" So, I think it's gonna be a problem to get people regularly.\nphd a: What about Joachim, maybe he can \nprofessor e: But but we c But I think, you know, we get some scattered things from this and that. And I I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television, but \nphd a: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones.\nphd c: Well, and they 're already they 're these things are already recorded,\ngrad g: Yep.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: we don't have to ask them to even and I 'm not sure wh how they record it, but they must record from individual \nprofessor e: n Well No, I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded. I 'm talking about new ones\nphd c: Why why not?\nprofessor e: because because because we would be asking them to do something different.\nphd c: Well, we can find out. I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in in LDC getting data, uh, and \nprofessor e: Right, that's the found data idea.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor e: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel, let's say, of a distant mike.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor e: And u I think routinely they would not do this. So, since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff, I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere\nphd c: Right. Great. OK. \nprofessor e: and uh But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to the I might be able to talk them into it.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad g: Um. We 're getting towards the end of our disk space, so we should think about trying to wrap up here.\nphd c: That's a good way to end a meeting.\nprofessor e: OK. Well I don't why don't we why d u why don't we uh uh turn them turn\ngrad g: OK, leave leave them on for a moment until I turn this off, cuz that's when it crashed last time.\npostdoc b: Oh.

We know that all that's there and it's a g worthwhile thing to study, but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things.\nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: Whereas th i I would think that uh you we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking.\nphd d: Uh - huh.

Then you can get the Cuz you need If it's three hundred uh i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really \nphd d: Yeah.\nprofessor e: And and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of of what's going on, much less any kind of reasonable statistics.\ngrad g: Right.\nphd c: Now, why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the \ngrad g: Well, that's That's what I was gonna bring up.\nphd c: I mean, you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand,\nprofessor e: Um, OK, yeah. So let's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation.\nphd c: right? I 'm sorry.\nprofessor e: So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy, such as the energy in the LPC residuals, such as I mean there's a bunch of things I mean, increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. In the far - field mike.\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: Oh, OK.\nprofessor e: Um, and uh, it's not obvious, I mean, you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time. But when you start going past that and trying to do better, it's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the you know, the right detector. So the idea is to have some ground truth first. And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say \" OK this, i you know, it's it's really here \".\nphd a: But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts?\nphd c: What I mean is get it from the close - talking mikes.\nprofessor e: Uh, yeah.\nphd c: A or ge get a first pass from those,\nprofessor e: We t we t w we t we talked about that.\nphd c: and then go through sort of It 'd be a lot faster probably to \nphd f: And you can \ngrad g: Yeah, that's his, uh \nprofessor e: We we we talked about that. s But so it's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is,\nphd c: Yeah, I just \nprofessor e: the idea was, i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway, and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful,\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor e: and we could Uh it's a question of what you bootstrap from. You know, do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better, or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements, uh from the close - talking mike. I mean, even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time.\nphd c: Well, that's what I wonder, because um or how bad it is,\nprofessor e: Well\nphd c: be um, because that would be interesting\ngrad g: I 'm working on a program to do that, and \nphd c: especially because the bottleneck is the transcription. Right? I mean, we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for. We have the audio data, we have the close - talking mike,\nprofessor e: Yeah.\nphd c: so I mean it seems like one kind of project that's not perfect, but um, that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is, you know, if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech,\nprofessor e: Right, we discussed that.\nphd c: you know, how can we detect that from a far - field?\ngrad g: And \npostdoc b: Oh.\ngrad g: I 've I 've written a program to do that,\nphd c: OK, I 'm sorry I missed the \ngrad g: and it, uh \nprofessor e: It's OK.\ngrad g: and so but it's it's doing something very, very simple. It just takes a threshold, based on on the volume,\nphd c: Uh - huh.\nphd f: Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand.\nphd c: Right, by hand. Yeah.\nphd f: Yeah.\ngrad g: um, and then it does a median filter, and then it looks for runs. And, it seems to work, I 've I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters, to get it to actually generate something, and I haven't I don't what I 'm working on was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have, into Transcriber. And so I told I said it would take about a day. I 've worked on it for about half a day,\ngrad h: I have to go.\ngrad g: so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with.\nphd c: OK.\nprofessor e: See, this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working, because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this, and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided,\nphd c: Right. I 'm sorry. I just \nprofessor e: but I couldn't remember all of it.\nphd c: It\nprofessor e: So, I think it was partly that, you know, give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like, partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against, you know, when when he he gets his thing going,\ngrad g: But \nprofessor e: uh, and \nphd c: Well, it's definitely good to have somebody look at it.

Um, uh, if you if you did a high - pass filtering, as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation, uh, uh, Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that, uh, perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values, and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum. So, what what Hirsch did was, uh, set them to zero set the negative values to zero. So if you imagine a a waveform that's all positive, which is the time trajectory of energy, um, and, uh, shifting it downwards, and then getting rid of the negative parts, that's essentially throwing away the low - energy things. And it's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible. You know, you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing. I mean, you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation, but because you have these non - causal windows, you 're getting these funny things coming in, uh, at n And, um, what if you did? I mean, there's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original, according to some equation. I mean, you also could, uh, just try to make it nicer.\ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: And one of the things you could do is, you could do some sort of VAD - like thing\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some, uh, very low or or near zero value. I mean, uh, I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are, uh \ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: or pre - echoes, whichever they are are are, uh, part of what's causing the problem, you actually could get rid of them.\ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: Be pretty simple.

Imagine you 're the the subject. You 're gonna be in here, and somebody And and you see, uh, either th the three - D model, or uh, a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg. So you actually see that. Um. The uh, um, first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg. So, just off a textbook, uh, tourist guide, to familiarize, uh, yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names, like Fischergasse and so forth. So that's part one. Part two is, you 're told that this huge new, wonderful computer system exists, that can y tell you everything you want to know, and it understands you completely. And so you 're gonna pick up that phone, dial a number, and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve. First you have to know find out how to get to that place, maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there. Maybe So, the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild. The third one is to get information on the history of an object. The fourth one And then the g system breaks down. It crashes, And \ngrad d: a At the third? Right then?\ngrad b: After the third task.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad b: And then Or after the fourth. Some find @ @ Forget that for now. And then, a human operator comes on, and and exp apologizes that the system has crashed, but, you know, urges you to continue, you know? now with a human operator. And so, you have basically the same tasks again, just with different objects, and you go through it again, and that was it. Oh, and one one little bit w And uh, the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are, via GPS. When the human operator comes on, um, that person does not know. So the GPS is crashed as well. So the person first has to ask you \" Where are you? \". And so you have to do some s tell the person sort of where you are, depending on what you see there. Um, this is a a a a a bit that I d I don't think we Did we discuss that bit? Uh, I just sort of squeezed that in now. But it's something, uh, that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know. So.\ngrad d: So, in the display you can Oh, you said that you cou you might have a display that shows, like, the \ngrad b: Yeah. a Additionally, y you have a a a sort of a map type display.\ngrad d: a w your perspective? sort of?\ngrad b: Uh, two - D.\ngrad d: And so, as you \ngrad b: n\ngrad d: Oh, two - D. OK.\ngrad b: Two - D.\ngrad d: So as you move through it that's - they just track it on the for themselves\ngrad b: Yeah. b y You don't That's \ngrad d: there.\ngrad b: I don't know. I but y I don't think you really move, sort of.\ngrad d: OK. So\ngrad b: Yeah? I mean that would be an an an enormous technical effort, unless we would We can show it walks to, you know. We can have movies of walking, you walking through through Heidelberg, and u ultimately arriving there.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Maybe we wanna do that. Yeah.\ngrad d: Uh, I was just trying to figure out how how ambitious the system is.\ngrad b: The map was sort of intended to You want to go to that place. You know, and it's sort of there.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: And you see the label of the name So we get those names, pronunciation stuff, and so forth, and we can change that.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. So your tasks don't require you to I mean, uh yo you 're told So when your task is, I don't know, \" Go buy stamps \" or something like that? So, do you have to respond? or does your Uh, what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system? Like, w what you 're doing now? or \ngrad b: Well, we 'll see what people do.\ngrad d: There's no OK, so it's just like, \" Let's figure out what they would say under the circumstances \".\ngrad b: Yeah, and and we will record both sides. I mean, we will record the Wi - the Wizard \ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad b: I mean, in both cases it's gonna be a human, in the computer, and in the operator case.\ngrad d: Uh - huh.\ngrad b: And we will re there will be some dialogue, you know?

We can ins instruct the, uh, wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be. But um, maybe the maybe what you 're suggesting Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor, the data, if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh, task results in a question and then there's an answer and that's the end of the task? You wanna m have it more more steps, sort of?\ngrad d: Yeah, I I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction I mean, th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad d: All they know is it's this great system that could do s stuff.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Oh yeah, but to some extent this is a different discussion.\ngrad d: Right? So \nprofessor c: OK? So. Uh, we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment, and the data collection, and all that sorta stuff\ngrad d: Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: and we do have, um, a student who is a candidate for wizard.

Um I I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region,\nphd a: Mmm.\ngrad e: so\nphd d: California.\nphd a: I think \ngrad e: California.\nphd h: California.\nphd a: Um may I make one suggestion? Instead of age put date of uh year of birth\ngrad e: Sure.\nphd a: because age will change, but The year of birth changes, you know, stays the same, usually.\ngrad e: Oh.\nphd c: A actually, wait a minute,\ngrad e: Birth year?\npostdoc g: Although on \nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: shouldn't it be the other way around?\nphd d: Not for me.\npostdoc g: course on the other on the other hand you could you view it as the age at the time of the \nphd c: On the other side,\nphd a: Well the thing is, if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that \nphd c: yeah.\npostdoc g: Yes, but what we care about is the age at at the recording date rather than the \nphd c: O yeah.\nphd d: But there's no other date on the form.\nphd c: W we don't care how they old they really are.\nphd a: Well well I don't know.\npostdoc g: Yes. Unless we wanna send them a card.\ngrad e: Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for.\nphd a: Anyway.\npostdoc g: Yeah, that's true.\nphd c: I still don't see the problem.\ngrad e: Either way yeah I think I think age is alright\nphd a: OK.\ngrad e: and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: so, anyway. And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time, the speaker form only once, the digit form every time even if you don't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting. OK? And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form. And that should just be one person whose name I don't know. OK?\ngrad f: Do you want this Adam?\ngrad e: Uh sure. Thank you.\nprofessor b: So uh\ngrad e: OK so should we do agenda items?\nprofessor b: Uh oh that's a good idea. I shouldn't run the meeting.\ngrad e: Uh well I have I wanna talk about new microphones and wireless stuff.\npostdoc g: Mmm.\ngrad e: And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results. Anything else?\nphd c: I guess what time do we have to leave? Three thirty?\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah,\ngrad e: Why don't you go first then.\nphd c: so.\nprofessor b: Yeah, good idea.\nphd a: OK.\nphd c: Um Well, I I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation, no cross - word models, no trigrams a bigram recognizer and that's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations. Um and thanks to Don's help wh who Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um you know separated used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes, up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that that's twenty minutes or so? Um yeah because I guess there's some,\ngrad e: Or so.\nphd c: and Don can talk to Jane about this, there's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier. Anyway so it's twenty minutes and I actually\ngrad e: Hmm.\nphd c: um\ngrad e: I was that did that did that recording have the glitch in the middle?\npostdoc g: I 'm puzzled by that. I oh oh, I see.\nphd c: There's there's a \npostdoc g: Oh there was a glitch somewhere.\nphd c: yeah, so that actually um\ngrad f: Was it twenty minutes in,\nphd c: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know\npostdoc g: I forgot about that.\ngrad f: I thought \nphd a: Well it was interesting,\npostdoc g: Well, I mean, they \nphd a: suddenly the the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent\ngrad e: I don't remember when it is.\npostdoc g: but I was able to can transcribe\nphd a: but i looking at the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the it was actually recognized\nphd c: Wel\ngrad e: Oh no.\ngrad f: Yeah, that might be that might be that might be my fault.\npostdoc g: Wow.\nphd a: so\ngrad e: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch.\ngrad f: I 'm not \nphd a: OK.\nphd c: No actually it was yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um\ngrad f: yeah, I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time,\npostdoc g: Oh. That's not good.\nphd c: Yeah\nphd a: OK.\nphd c: so that's what we have\ngrad e: Alright.\ngrad f: so\nphd c: but that that will be completely gone if this synch time problem\npostdoc g: Yeah.\ngrad e: The the glitch\nphd a: So so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever, up to that time to\npostdoc g: And the only glitch \ngrad e: yeah.\npostdoc g: yeah.\nphd c: So you guys know.\nprofessor b: S sorry I haven't seen the email,\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad e: Th - the\npostdoc g: The the well wait\nprofessor b: what was the score?\nphd c: So here's the actual copy of the email\npostdoc g: we should say something about the glitch. He he can say something about the glitch.\nphd c: um oh OK\ngrad e: yeah.\npostdoc g: Cuz it's it's it's h it's it's very small \nphd c: so does this glitch occur at other \ngrad e: There there there's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized\npostdoc g: very small. Yep.\nphd c: Oh.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: Right.\ngrad e: so the that that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second\nprofessor b: Hmm.\ngrad f: Hmm.\ngrad e: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there's a little part where it starts doing doing click sounds.\nprofessor b: So \nphd c: And is it only once that that happens?\ngrad e: But yeah\nphd c: OK.\ngrad e: it right once in the middle.\nphd c: There's the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong\nprofessor b: so so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice,\nphd c: but\ngrad e: Um But that shouldn't affect anything\nphd c: OK so that's actually\npostdoc g: S and it \nprofessor b: you see this here?\nphd c: It y it's \ngrad e: yeah yeah \" bah \"\nphd c: OK no \nphd a: Oh, and \nphd c: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don \nphd d: Huh.\nphd c: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it\ngrad e: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything.\nphd c: but they\ngrad f: Yeah, I don't know exactly what affected it\npostdoc g: I agree. I agree.\nphd a: I I have \ngrad f: but I 'll I 'll talk to you about it,\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad e: But I I do remember \nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad f: I 'll show you the point.\npostdoc g: Yeah. It it had no effect on my transcription,\nphd a: Mmm.\npostdoc g: you know, I mean I I had no trouble hearing it and and having time bins\ngrad e: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect.\npostdoc g: but there was a Oh.\nphd c: Well, the the synch time the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should,\ngrad f: That's what happened.\npostdoc g: Oh.\nphd h: Yeah.\ngrad e: Where where they weren't monotonic.\ngrad f: There was yeah, I mean \nphd c: right? There's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame.\nphd h: Yeah.\npostdoc g: Oh, interesting.\nphd c: And so then, I mean you look at that and it's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right\ngrad e: Oh OK so that's\ngrad f: Hmm.\npostdoc g: Oh.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: so anyway it's it's just \ngrad e: yeah sounds like a bug.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\nphd c: that's why we only have twenty minutes but there's a significant amount of \ngrad f: Non - zero? Um there are like more cuz there's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran,\ngrad e: The other one I saw was that it yeah.\ngrad f: I mean but there were there was a point.\nphd c: Yeah that was fine. That that was OK.\ngrad e: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad e: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug.\ngrad f: Uh.\nphd c: Well that would really be a problem, yeah. So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd c: um and what's which \ngrad e: So that's very encouraging.\nphd c: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition,\nprofessor b: Hmm.\nphd h: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Cool.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: there's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which\nphd d: Trent Lott.\nphd c: um I mean these are sort of funny ones,\nphd d: It 'll get those though.\nphd c: there's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references, I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see\ngrad e: I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: but um it's pretty good.\ngrad e: because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right?\nphd c: Well so I guess we can generate\ngrad e: Sounds likes?\nphd a: There are a fair number of errors that are, you know where got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong.\npostdoc g: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: um\ngrad e: Yeah, and who cares? And and there were lots of of course the \" uh uh \" - s, \" in on \" - s \" of uh \" - s.\nphd a: Mmm, so if \nphd c: there's No those are actually\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: so is it like PZM is three words, it's PZM,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: I mean there's nothing There's no language model for PZM or\ngrad e: Right. Ri - ri right.\nphd c: um\ngrad e: Did you say there's no language for PZM?\nphd c: No language model, I mean those \ngrad e: Do you mean so every time someone says PZM it's an error? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings.\nphd c: Well well there's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there \ngrad e: Yeah, that's right, Jimlet.\nprofessor b: Well, we don't even know what that means,\nphd c: so but this is really encouraging because\nprofessor b: so I\ngrad e: Yeah, that's right.\nphd c: so, I mean the bottom line is even though it's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained mostly trained recognizer\ngrad e: Right.\nphd c: and Switchboard - two is got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic\ngrad e: Excellent.\nphd c: and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that's great.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety - three workshop\nphd c: Um\nprofessor b: and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Oh yeah\nprofessor b: you know\nphd c: I mean this is really,\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: and thanks to Andreas who, I mean this is a\nphd a: Mmm.\ngrad e: Well especially for the very first run, I mean you \nphd a: Oh it's the \nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: eh um\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: yeah\ngrad e: the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but\nphd c: So and what al also this means is that\npostdoc g: Right.\nphd c: um\ngrad e: Not Switchboard,\nphd a: Well it's \nphd c: I mean there's a bunch of things in this note to various people\ngrad e: uh Broadcast News.\nphd c: especially I guess um with Jane that that would help for since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring. I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by \nprofessor b: Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so you know the language model was straight from from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or or\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet?\npostdoc g: That's amazing.\ngrad e: Yeah, so that's great.\nphd c: No.\nprofessor b: OK.\nphd c: And actually we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models\npostdoc g: That's amazing.\nphd a: Well that's those are the only we ones there are,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: which I guess\nphd d: I was just gonna say,\nphd c: so that's the on that's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of\nphd d: yeah.\nphd a: I mean\ngrad e: Yeah.\nphd a: Right.\nphd c: and I guess Ramana, so a guy at SRI said that um there's not a huge amount of difference going from \nprofessor b: Right.\nphd c: it's it's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech.\nphd d: It's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech\nphd c: So.\nphd a: Oh yeah.\nphd c: Right.\nphd d: right?\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah,\nphd c: Right, so it's so\nprofessor b: but for Broadcast News when we we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss.\ngrad e: Right, it was not a big deal.\nphd c: Yeah\nphd a: I should I should say that the language model is not just Switchboard\nphd c: so I wou so that's good.\ngrad e: Although combining em worked well.\nphd a: it's also I mean there's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight\nphd c: Yeah.\nphd a: uh because\nprofessor b: Uh - huh.\nphd c: Like Trent Lott must have been from\nphd a: mm - hmm, right.\nphd c: I guess Switchboard was before\nphd a: Um By the way just for fun we also ran,\nphd c: uh.\nprofessor b: Good point.\nphd a: I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: so just for the heck of it I ran that\ngrad e: And it said a hundred percent male?\nphd a: um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right.\nphd c: The j\nphd a: Yeah so\ngrad e: Oh it did?\npostdoc g: Oh that's I 'm glad.\ngrad e: It got all two genders?\nphd c: Yeah but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance\nphd a: Yeah. Yes.\nphd c: and uh and that's interesting cuz I think the their language models are quite different so and I I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that, you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he's so much worse is the lapel.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: Right.\npostdoc g: That makes a lot of sense,\nphd c: So it's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when when we get new microphones\npostdoc g: yeah. Very possible.\nprofessor b: Yeah I I I would bet on that too\nphd c: that would be worth it\nprofessor b: cuz he certainly in that when as a as a burp user he was he was a pretty uh strong one.\nphd c: um Yeah\ngrad e: Sheep.\nphd c: he he he sounded to me just from he sounded like a,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: what's it a sheep or a goat?\nprofessor b: Sheep.\ngrad e: A sheep.\nphd c: Sheep,\ngrad e: Baah.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Sheep is good.\nphd c: right. Sounded good.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Right so um so I guess the good news is that\npostdoc g: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: and and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings. So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no no tailoring at all.\nphd a: I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because the \nphd c: Yeah. The voca the vocabulary especially\ngrad e: Or just dictionary.\nphd c: yeah.\nphd a: Not that much the vocabulary actually\nphd c: Yeah, so.\nphd a: I think um well we have to see but it's uh \nphd c: Yeah. It's pretty good um so then\nprofessor b: Have to add PZM and so on\ngrad e: And I have to try it on the far field mike\nprofessor b: but\nphd c: PZM\ngrad e: yeah.\nphd c: and then there's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said, you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL. there's things like that where, you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but in general it was really good and I 'm hoping and this is this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments, I mean it's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information. For example about, you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times. Um so that 'll be something that actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place. Because it's just gonna give us time marks\nphd d: But you know \ngrad e: Well we 've done that for one meeting.\nphd c: so. For forced alignment.\ngrad e: Uh oh oh f not for words\nphd c: Ye - right.\ngrad e: I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not not for words.\nphd c: Right. So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality\ngrad e: Right.\nphd c: and then I was thinking it \ngrad e: So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription. Maybe actually mark the word boundaries.\nphd c: Oh or i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Um but I think it's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy.\ngrad e: Right, right.\nphd c: It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around, if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good. So that's about it.\nprofessor b: I r\nphd d: I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though, I mean if we 're pr\ngrad e: That we 're starting so well?\nphd d: yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody's gonna do well on\nprofessor b: Oh\ngrad e: Don't worry about it w d that's that's the close talking mikes. Try it on the P Z Ms and and\nprofessor b: Yeah, which I would which well n n n n\nphd d: So the real value of the database is these?\nphd h: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah, abso well no but\nprofessor b: I mean there's still just the w the percentages and, I mean they 're not a as we 've talked about before there's probably overlaps\nphd c: This i yeah. This is not that good.\nprofessor b: there's probably overlaps in in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but but there's other phenomena, it's a meeting, it's a different thing and there's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could, I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the\nphd c: Right.\nprofessor b: and uh see if it's, you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it's not maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and and then if for the PZM it's seventy or something like that that's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: so\nphd c: No I think it's really, I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the the text um yeah they 're pretty good so and and it's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard so that's good. And um let's see there was one more thing I wanted to to mention I can't remember um Sorry can't remember. anyway it's \npostdoc g: Congratulations is really great.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: well it was, I mean I really didn't do this myself\ngrad e: Yeah, it's really good.\nphd c: so Andreas set up this recognizer and by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there so I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um so\nphd a: We we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here. That's you know if if there are more machines um uh here plus people can could run their own uh you know variants of of of the recognition runs um certainly doable. Um.\nprofessor b: Yeah and well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training, yeah.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Seems reasonable.\npostdoc g: I need t Hmm. I need to ask one question.\nphd a: Yeah.\npostdoc g: Which is um so this issue of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted Yeah, well, so what I mean is um the uh the data that you take into SRI, first first question, you 're maintaining it in in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that that kind of stuff, right?\nphd a: U um\nphd c: From the outside world or\npostdoc g: By uh people uh who are not associated with this project.\nphd a: Oh.\ngrad e: It's human subjects issues, I told you about that.\nphd c: Um oh.\npostdoc g: Exactly.\nphd c: Well OK we have n no names. Although I sh um\ngrad e: That that's not the issue,\nphd c: de audio data itself?\ngrad e: it's just the audio data itself, until people have a chance to edit it.\npostdoc g: Mm - hmm, exactly.\nphd c: Uh so well I can I can protect my directories through there.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\nphd c: Right now they 're not they 're in the speech group directories which so I will \npostdoc g: Great.\nphd c: I didn't know that actually.\nprofessor b: Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions,\nphd c: Yeah OK.\nprofessor b: say it's OK.\nphd c: Right OK.\npostdoc g: Yeah, we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it's but this this meeting that you have, no problem cuz I I well I mean I I speak for myself\ngrad e: It's us.\npostdoc g: but but I think that we didn't do anything that but well anyway so uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects\nphd c: That's true.\npostdoc g: and I don't know how that stands, I mean if you if you get fantastic results and it's involving data which which later end up being lessened by, you know certain elisions, then I don't know but I wanted to raise that issue,\nprofessor b: Well we,\npostdoc g: that's all.\nprofessor b: I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it hopefully it will be fairly quick but we get the transcriptions, people approve them and so on it's just that we 're\ngrad e: Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts\npostdoc g: Great.\nphd a: Mmm.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\ngrad e: and get back any bleeps that they want\nphd c: Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought.\nprofessor b: It's gonna be a rare thing that there's a bleep for the most part.\nphd a: U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling, um I don't know who, I mean how this was done but is is there are there any um issues with downsampling\nphd c: Don did this.\nphd a: because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly um so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand. And is there any um i are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another?\ngrad f: There are lots of w there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on,\nphd a: OK. Right. OK.\ngrad f: like anti - aliasing stuff.\nphd a: So so the th\ngrad e: I don't think we even know which one I assume you 're using syncat to do it?\ngrad f: No, I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample.\ngrad e: Or sound resample?\nphd c: Re - re ref\ngrad e: Resample.\nphd c: yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah and Dan's archaic acronyms.\ngrad f: RSMP. Yeah, I don't really.\nphd c: Missing all the vowels.\ngrad f: I just yeah I found it.\nphd c: Some of the vowels,\ngrad e: Not all of them.\nphd c: almost all the vowels, that's the hard part.\nphd a: So so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms,\ngrad e: And a few of the consonants.\nphd a: I mean segment them but not downsample them.\nphd c: Yeah we could we could try that and and compare\nphd a: And and feed them to feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if if the SRI front - end does something.\ngrad f: Yeah, that's \nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad e: I suspect that's sort of premature optimization, but Sure.\nphd c: We can try it. I I only downsampled them first cuz I was\nphd a: Well \ngrad f: I mean that's just one line that's one line of code to comment at\nphd c: yeah\nphd a: Right and and it doesn't is no more work for um you know for us.\ngrad f: so\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd c: Well they 're just bigger to transfer, that's why I s downsampled them before but\nphd a: Well but they 're only twice as big so\nphd c: Well I mean that was if it's the same then we can downsample here\nphd a: I mean it's it's just a\nphd c: but if it's \ngrad f: Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad f: so, but no, I mean it's not i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it \nphd c: We could try that.\nphd a: Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know\ngrad f: it would \nphd a: minus the transfer time it would it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and and and\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad e: It's about a fifty minute drive, right?\nphd a: And and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why\nphd c: Well it takes more disk space too so I was just \nphd a: and, you know, what Yeah.\ngrad f: Mmm. In the front - end we could do that.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor b: So you just train just different filters\ngrad f: Yeah, I \nprofessor b: and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is\ngrad f: Yeah, I can imagine it would be \nphd a: Right. Right.\nphd c: So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there's any differences.\ngrad f: I mean I guess there's some \nphd a: You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance.\ngrad f: Hmm.\nphd a: So in other words right,\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd a: so\ngrad e: It just seems to me that, you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that. I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other I don't think that gives you any information.\nphd c: Well it's just as easy to to give you the sixteen K individual,\ngrad e: Yep.\nphd c: it was just more disk space you know for storing them\nprofessor b: Are you are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there?\nphd c: so\nphd a: Mel cepstrum.\nprofessor b: So probably doesn't matter.\nphd c: Well we could try.\ngrad f: There's there's your answer.\nprofessor b: But but it wouldn't hurt to try,\nphd c: Could easily try\nphd a: That's what I would assume but you never know,\nprofessor b: yeah.\nphd c: so\nphd a: you know.\nprofessor b: Sure. No the reason I say this\npostdoc g: Just Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not b you wouldn't expect to be so much but\nphd c: Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti stick them somewhere\ngrad f: Yeah, it's it's really not a problem.\nphd a: Actually, no.\nphd c: and I 'll rerun it with\nphd a: Don't stop. Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters,\ngrad f: Keep going. Yeah.\nphd a: so shouldn't use you should s you know, get\ngrad f: Yeah, I mean I 'll I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same,\nphd c: OK.\nphd a: Right.\ngrad f: it's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: Right. Right.\ngrad f: and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory,\nphd a: Right.\nphd c: I mean I corrected all \ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: that's not a problem.\nphd c: I mean I hand - edited the whole the whole meeting so that can be run it's just Once we get the the bug out.\nphd a: Mmm.\npostdoc g: One one question which is I I had the impression from this from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring,\nphd a: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\npostdoc g: is that I thought that in order to\ngrad e: Yep.\npostdoc g: so it was so it's like there's already down\ngrad e: There's one level that's already happening right here.\nprofessor b: This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz. Which is more that anybody needs\npostdoc g: OK.\ngrad e: Right.\ngrad f: Oh.\ngrad e: And it gets downsampled to sixteen.\npostdoc g: OK.\nprofessor b: so\nphd c: And that's actually said in your meeting,\ngrad f: Hmm.\npostdoc g: Oh OK.\nphd c: that's how I know that.\npostdoc g: That's exactly, and that's how I know it.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: I I It's like are we downsampling to sixteen?\nprofessor b: It's a digital audio orientation for the board\nphd c: Right.\nphd a: Mmm.\nprofessor b: it's in the monitor so it's\nphd c: Thank God it's not more than that.\ngrad e: So \nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: And I have no idea what filter it's using,\ngrad f: Is eight kilohertz is is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice?\ngrad e: so\nprofessor b: For telephone stuff.\ngrad e: Telephone.\nphd d: Telephone.\ngrad f: Yeah that's what I was gonna say, I mean like \nprofessor b: So it's it's it's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database\ngrad f: so Oh, I see, so.\nprofessor b: and so that was a standard for that sixteen s\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad e: So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing.\nprofessor b: Sixteen is more common for for uh broadband stuff that isn't \ngrad f: Right.\ngrad e: That isn't music.\nprofessor b: that isn't music and isn't telephone,\nphd c: And I guess if you 're comparing like uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that\nprofessor b: yeah.\ngrad e: Why is that?\nprofessor b: I don't know.\nphd c: right? Well I don I mean if it's any better\nprofessor b: No actually I would think that you would you would get better you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike.\ngrad e: All the way around I 'd think.\nprofessor b: Uh but who knows? I mean we do we we we we we wanna find all this stuff out,\nphd c: Yeah well we could try it.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: we don't know.\ngrad e: We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans.\nphd c: OK. Yeah.\nprofessor b: Uh yeah. Yeah.\nphd c: Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um well well it's sort of related but um good news also uh I got well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that's too bad cuz they 're very animated and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on on\nphd a: They 're less animated.\nphd c: Well but he has fewer he he won't have more than eight and it's a meeting on even deeper understanding, EDU, so that sounds interesting. As a compliment to our front - end meeting\ngrad e: Dot EDU?\nphd c: and um so that's gonna start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it or or put a push a button or something when they wanna make a note about \" oh boy you should probably erase those last few \" or uh \" wait I want this not to be recorded now \" or uh something like that s\nprofessor b: Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point?\npostdoc g: The cross pads?\ngrad e: Yeah, we could do it with the cross pads.\nphd c: Cuz I was thinking you know if if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it's a group that we don't know um and this came up talking to to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: so I don't know if anyone has ideas or you could even write down \" oh it's about three twenty five and \" \nprofessor b: Well what I was just suggesting is is we have these this cross pad just for this purpose\ngrad e: Yeah, and use that.\nprofessor b: and just use that\ngrad e: Not a bad idea.\nprofessor b: and if we sink it in \nphd c: That would be great.\nprofessor b: The other thing is eh\nphd c: That be great.\nprofessor b: I don't know if you know this or if it's a question for the mail to Dan but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board?\ngrad e: I don't know. I don't know. I 'll send mail to Dan and ask. I I think that it's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it's one board with two digital channels.\nprofessor b: Oh it is one board.\ngrad e: E eight each. So it it takes two fibers in to the one board. And so w I think if we wanna do that more than that we 'd have to have two boards, and then you have the synchronization issue.\nprofessor b: But that's a question because that would if it was possible cuz it is i you know already we have a a a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked\ngrad e: Right.\nprofessor b: and it's not just cuz we haven't been to the store, right it's \nphd d: What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels, is it the\ngrad e: Eight.\nphd d: It just it's eight channels come in, does it have do with the sampling rate?\ngrad e: It's eight. I have no idea. But each each fiber channel has eight eight channels and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card.\nprofessor b: It might be a hard limitation,\ngrad e: So\nprofessor b: I mean one thing is it the whole thing as I said is is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes requirements up a bit\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: but\nphd d: I was just wondering if if that could change.\ngrad e: I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff.\nphd d: If we could drop that.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: So I I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: OK on the uh are we done with that? So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes, so I got a quote um We can fit we have room for one more wireless and the wireless, this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars, it I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner the receiver the other end, that's uh four thirty um and then also\nphd c: For for each?\nphd d: Wow.\nphd c: I mean the tuner is four thirty for each.\ngrad e: Yep.\nphd c: Wow.\ngrad e: And we just need one more so so\nprofessor b: Yeah at least w we got the good ones.\ngrad e: Yeah. So that's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these.\nprofessor b: Yeah. OK.\ngrad e: Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony\nphd d: Oh.\ngrad e: believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset.\npostdoc g: Mmm.\ngrad e: So if we wanna use a different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and they apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself. And that's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece.\nprofessor b: There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in, you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself?\ngrad e: Becau - the reason is the only only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector.\nprofessor b: No I understand. The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this.\ngrad e: Oh I 'm sure they would, they would just charge us,\nphd d: Well, and they 'd probably want quantity too,\ngrad e: so.\nprofessor b: Well\nphd d: they 'd\nprofessor b: no they 'll just charge us more, so it's this\nphd d: Mmm.\ngrad e: So so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes?\nprofessor b: Not before having one come here and have some people try it out.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor b: Because there's no point in doing that if it's not gonna be any better.\ngrad e: So why don't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: And and see if that works.\nprofessor b: And see if it's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more.\nphd c: Comfort.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it's just the the\ngrad e: Right, it's just they 're not comfortable to wear.\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd c: Could make our own handbands and\ngrad e: Um, and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA and so it will take about a week to get here.\nprofessor b: Yeah well it's \ngrad e: Um so OK to just go order?\nprofessor b: We 're in this for the long term, yeah. Just order it.\ngrad e: OK\nphd c: It's a lot of money for a handband.\ngrad e: and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad e: cuz I think that's how we did it before.\nprofessor b: Uh we 'll do this off - line, yeah.\ngrad f: It's a long time to get from LA.\ngrad e: OK. And then nine channels is the maximum we can do, so.\nprofessor b: Uh y right cuz so one is for the daisy chain so that's fifteen instead of sixteen\ngrad e: Without getting more stuff.\nprofessor b: and there's six on the table so that's nine.\ngrad e: Right.\nphd c: Can I ask a really dumb question?\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: Is is there any way we can have you know like a a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk that \ngrad e: Probably.\nprofessor b: That's a good idea.\nphd c: I mean \nprofessor b: That's not a dumb question, it's a good idea,\nphd c: Well I mean \nphd a: Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing,\nprofessor b: yeah.\ngrad e: I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the\ngrad f: That's like the Conch.\nphd c: Well but \nphd d: Like at conferences\nphd a: you know r\nphd c: well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people\ngrad f: See, look.\nphd c: um and I don't know identifying somehow?\nphd d: so nail the chairs down.\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah, somehow.\nphd c: You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer.\ngrad e: It's not a bad idea.\nprofessor b: No that no no\nphd a: \nprofessor b: that's a very if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work.\nphd d: The Springer mike.\nphd c: I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that.\nprofessor b: Let's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there's a ninth which is passed around to \ngrad e: A hand - held, yeah.\nprofessor b: that's a good idea\nphd d: Infinite expansion.\nprofessor b: Right. Kind of rules out overlap but but uh\nphd c: Well or also for you know if people are not\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: Well we could just hand around the lapel.\nprofessor b: Uh no no that's \ngrad e: Rather than get a \nphd c: No not the lapel.\ngrad e: do you want a handset?\nprofessor b: No.\ngrad e: Well I mean is the is the hand - held really any better?\nphd d: Liz hates the lapel.\nprofessor b: Yes.\nphd c: I don't know\ngrad e: OK.\nphd c: but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal.\nprofessor b: No it no it depends on the hand - held\ngrad e: Is awful?\nprofessor b: but hand many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it it is less uh susceptible to hand noises. If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk.\nphd d: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Right. I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor b: so\ngrad e: So I wonder if they have one that will hook up.\nprofessor b: Yeah. They have What?\ngrad e: I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves.\nphd d: Well, you wouldn't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room, right?\nprofessor b: No that's uh you need a transmitter.\ngrad e: What?\nphd d: Is th isn't that built into the mike?\nprofessor b: Oh I see. Get a get a different radio, yeah.\nphd c: Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless\nprofessor b: Yeah. But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver.\nphd d: Have a little antenna coming out the bottom.\ngrad e: It's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike, isn't it?\nphd d: But then the mike has to h\nphd a: Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of\nprofessor b: No no \nphd c: Right.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd a: \nprofessor b: so right, so this is a good point, so yeah you have these these mikes with a little antenna on the end right?\ngrad e: OK. And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver?\nprofessor b: I don't know. You 'll have to check with them,\ngrad e: OK I 'll I 'll ask.\nprofessor b: yeah. But that's that's a great idea\nphd d: It's just a frequency.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor b: and then just sort of have that as the and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and and uh\nphd c: Yeah because there's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking um over each other \nphd a: Pretty soon.\nphd d: Mmm, yeah.\nphd c: it just there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and\nprofessor b: Right.\nphd a: Um Gotta go.\nprofessor b: Off you go, yeah.\ngrad e: OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits?\npostdoc g: I I thought of some extra a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention.\ngrad e: OK.\npostdoc g: One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far. So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine\ngrad e: uh Yep,\npostdoc g: and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month, I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten.\nphd c: Uh it's great \nprofessor b: Pretty close,\npostdoc g: So they 're still working.\nprofessor b: that's good.\nphd c: I j and this I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something\nphd d: Wow.\ngrad e: that's good.\nphd c: so it's really great\npostdoc g: It's working out, thanks.\nphd c: It's really great.\npostdoc g: Thanks. And then um also an idea for another meeting, which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data It's sort of a a little bit a little bit\nphd c: That's a great idea.\nprofessor b: Super idea.\ngrad e: Yep, that 'd be very interesting.\nphd c: That's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things,\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad e: I 'd love to hear what they have to say.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\nphd c: that's a great idea.\nphd d: So if we got them to talk about this meeting, it would be a meta meta meeting.\npostdoc g: Yeah. Yeah, exa exactly I guess nested several layers,\nprofessor b: Now you have eight transcribers and there's ten of us\npostdoc g: but\nprofessor b: so how do we do this, is the only thing.\nphd c: Or just have them talk amongst themselves.\nphd d: Have them have their own meeting.\nphd c: And have\npostdoc g: Well that's what I 'm thinking,\nprofessor b: Oh.\npostdoc g: yeah. Have them talk about the data and they and they 've made observations to me\nphd c: that would be great.\npostdoc g: like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap, in fact it does but there are other groups of similar size that have very little, you know it's part of it's it's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun, I think.\nphd c: That's a great idea.\ngrad e: Yeah, I 'd like to hear what they s say.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\nphd c: Be great.\nprofessor b: So maybe we could they could have a meeting more or less without us that to do this and we should record it\npostdoc g: OK.\nprofessor b: and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and and could you know could tell us about it.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\ngrad e: Give us a status.\nphd c: Yeah.\npostdoc g: Oh good. OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: It's they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break\ngrad e: That would be weird.\npostdoc g: What what yeah that's right.\nphd c: and I think that's a good idea,\npostdoc g: Yeah exactly, yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah.\nphd c: get them involved.\npostdoc g: Great.\nphd c: Um that's a great idea.\npostdoc g: Great.\nprofessor b: Super.\nphd c: I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well.\nprofessor b: OK.\npostdoc g: And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John John Fiscus visit tomorrow. And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts, the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo's been doing and then um the third part would and again he has some stuff that's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it, you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what what we 've chosen as ours and and discuss that kind of thing. And so but he's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon. S\nprofessor b: OK.\npostdoc g: And everybody who wants to attend is welcome. So\ngrad e: Oh, where you 're gonna meet?\npostdoc g: yeah. Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration.\nprofessor b: OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here. Yeah, OK.\npostdoc g: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: I assume we 're not gonna try to record it?\npostdoc g: Oh I think that would be hard, yeah.\nprofessor b: Yeah, I think just adds \ngrad e: Alright.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Um good.\npostdoc g: Thank you though, uh - huh.\nprofessor b: So maybe do digits and recess?\ngrad e: Unless there's anything else?\npostdoc g: Yeah. Yeah.\nphd d: Do digital ones?\nprofessor b: Uh OK.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\ngrad e: Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing?\nprofessor b: Yeah. No I don't think it's confusing. Well, it doesn't confuse me.\npostdoc g: When we do this in the key in the key in the key it has to indicate that channel change,\nphd d: Does it mess up the forms?\npostdoc g: right?\ngrad e: Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that, so. I mean other than free free form.\npostdoc g: Well i have a time mark.\nphd d: The on switch is here on the on the top there.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK.\ngrad e: And just clip it to your collar.\nprofessor b: That's fine.\ngrad j: OK, my name is uh Espen Eriksen. I 'm a Norwegian. Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley. Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gonna continue with the more of a research project work kind of work. So this semester I 'm starting up with a with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project. So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this. What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk. To try to do something about that. So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation, s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results. So it it's a it's a project goes over the course of one semester.\ngrad e: Great.\ngrad j: So I 'm just here today to introduce myself. Tell about I 'll be I 'll be working on this.\ngrad e: And are you staying at Berkeley or is are you just here a semester?\ngrad j: This is my second semester and last.\ngrad e: Ah second and last,\nprofessor b: Yeah.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad j: So I leave\nprofessor b: He's in the he's in the cour two two five D course.\ngrad j: Yeah, I 'm in Morgan's course,\nprofessor b: So, yeah.\ngrad j: yeah.\ngrad e: Good.\nphd d: Welcome.\npostdoc g: Then you then you go back to Norway, that's OK.\ngrad j: Yeah.\ngrad f: We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz. About doing some of the echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps, so. Cool.\ngrad j: Yeah.\nprofessor b: OK,\ngrad e: Digits?\nprofessor b: let's do digits. OK.\ngrad e: And stop.", "en_query": "What was the general discussion?", "zh_query": "一般性讨论是什么？", "fr_query": "Quelle était la discussion générale ?", "ukr_query": "Якою була загальна дискусія?", "en_summary": "The group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data.

{"fname": "academic_dev_37", "dialogue": "professor c: OK.\ngrad e: Extremely.\ngrad f: OK, um, so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information, ex than the top block. And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know, all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the, um uh, that you can give dual types. Oh, one thing I should mention is about \" designates \". I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well. So, um, strike out the M subscript on the middle block.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So basically now, um, this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change, which is that \" designates \" isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now.\nprofessor c: Good.\ngrad f: So we want s \" designates \" to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of, um, really important for say composition later on. So for instance, if some other construction says, you know, \" are you of type is this part of type whatever \", um, the \" designates \" tells you which sort of part is the meaning part. OK, so if you have like \" the big red ball \", you know, you wanna know if there's an object or a noun. Well, ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase.\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad f: Um, there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it's useful sometimes to talk about, um to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one, right? So the ball is the head of the phrase, \" the r the \", um, \" big red ball \", and the entity denoted by the word \" ball \" is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of, um, in interesting larger element.\nprofessor c: A a and the Yeah. And there's uh there's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head. And and this enables you to get that, if I understand you right.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Right, right.\ngrad e: That's the idea.\nprofessor c: Yeah yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: And, uh, you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language, you can refer to the head as a p the, you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: So that's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in.\nprofessor c: OK, so that all looks good. Let me Oh, w Oh. I don't know. Were you finished?\ngrad f: Um, there was a list of things that isn't included but you you can you can ask a question. That might @ @ it.\nprofessor c: OK. So, i if I understand this the aside from, uh, construed and all that sort of stuff, the the differences are mainly that, we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: or actually gone back to,\ngrad f: Right.\nprofessor c: if we go back far enough \ngrad f: Well, except for their construction meaning, so it's not clear that, uh Well, right now it's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type. So I don't know what a form type is.\nprofessor c: Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I 'm sorry, you 're right.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: A construction type. Uh, that's fine. But it, um \ngrad f: Right. A well, and a previous, um, you know, version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it. So you could say \" construct of type whatever designates something \".\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: But that was mostly for reference purposes, just to refer to the meaning pole. I don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning, which is really what we want most of the time I think.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Um, I I don't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h if there is a form category constraint, you could imagine having a triple there that says, you know that's kind of weird.\nprofessor c: No, no, no, I don't think so. I think that you 'll you 'll do fine.\ngrad e: I \nprofessor c: In fact, these are, um, as long as as Mark isn't around, these are form constraints. So a nominal expression is uh, the fact that it's animate, is semantic. The fact that it's n uh, a nominal expression I would say on most people's notion of of f you know, higher form types, this i this is one.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Yeah.", "en_query": "What was concluded on semantic specification?", "zh_query": "关于语义规范的讨论给出了什么结论？", "fr_query": "Qu'a-t-on conclu sur la spécification sémantique ?", "ukr_query": "Який висновок зроблено по семантичній специфікації?", "en_summary": "The revised semantic specification and construction formalism are more stable than the previous versions.

{"fname": "academic_dev_28", "dialogue": "grad f: Right. Well, I was, um, I think one of the perplexing problems is, um, for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away. But what I 'm thinking now is, I would start with with a reasonable set. Something something like, um, um like, uh, re regular phonetic features, just to just to start off that way. And do some phone recognition. Um, build a system that, uh, classifies these, um these feat uh, these intermediate categories using, uh, multi - band techniques. Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition. Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say, OK, well, I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category. That would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions. And then and then reiterate. Um, build the intermediate classifiers. Uh, do phoneme recognition. Look at the errors. And then postulate new or remove, um, intermediate categories.

So, I would mov I would then shift the focus to, um, something like Schw - Switchboard, uh, where I 'd I would be able to, um to model, um, intermediate categories that span across phonemes,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: not just within the phonemes, themselves, um, and then do the same process there, um, on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard.

{"fname": "academic_dev_44", "dialogue": "phd a: And, fff um, yeah. What we see is that these nets are not as good, except for the multi - English, which is always one of the best. Yeah, then we started to work on a large dat database containing, uh, sentences from the French, from the Spanish, from the TIMIT, from SPINE, uh from uh English digits, and from Italian digits. So this is the another line another set of lines in the table. Uh, @ @ with SPINE\nprofessor d: Ah, yes. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: and uh, actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data, uh, so we have to to redo the uh the experiment training the net with, uh PLP, but with delta. But\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: um this this net performed quite well. Well, it's it's better than the net using French, Spanish, and English only. Uh. So, uh, yeah. We have also started feature combination experiments. Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together. And this is The results are on the other document. Uh, we can discuss this after, perhaps well, just, @ @. Yeah, so basically there are four four kind of systems. The first one, yeah, is combining, um, two feature streams, uh using and each feature stream has its own MPL. So it's the kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first. The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal. The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs. And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs. Um, yeah. Mmm. You know you can you can comment these results,\nphd b: Yes, I can s I would like to say that, for example, um, mmm, if we doesn't use the delta - delta, uh we have an improve when we use s some combination. But when\nphd a: Yeah, we ju just to be clear, the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy.\nphd b: w Yeah, this Yeah, this number recognition acc\nphd a: So it's not the Again we switch to another \nphd b: Yes, and the baseline the baseline have i is eighty - two.\nprofessor d: Baseline is eighty - two.\nphd b: Yeah\nphd a: So it's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this.\nprofessor d: Uh, this is Italian mismatched.\nphd a: Um.\nphd b: Yeah, by the moment.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor d: OK.\nphd b: And first in the experiment - one I I do I I use different MLP,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better. Um. for the ne rest of experiment I use multi - English, only multi - English. And I try to combine different type of feature, but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy.\nphd a: Yeah, eh, actually, if w we look at the table, the huge table, um, we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: So, um uh, well, I don't think this is a bug but this this is something in probably in the MSG um process that uh I don't know what exactly. Perhaps the fact that the the there's no low - pass filter, well, or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian, or, well, something simple like that. But that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information.\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm.\nphd a: And as Carmen said, if we combine the two, we have the result, basically, of PLP.\nprofessor d: I Um, the uh, baseline system when you said the baseline system was uh, uh eighty - two percent, that was trained on what and tested on what? That was, uh Italian mismatched d uh, uh, digits, uh, is the testing,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: and the training is Italian digits?\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: So the \" mismatch \" just refers to the noise and and, uh microphone and so forth,\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: right? So, um did we have So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is is the uh Italian digits?\nphd b: The train the training of the HTK?\nprofessor d: The \nphd b: Yes. Ah yes!\nprofessor d: Yes.\nphd b: This h Yes. Th - Yes.\nprofessor d: Yes. Training of the net,\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: yeah. So, um So what that says is that in a matched condition, we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP. Now w would do we have a number, I suppose for the matched I I don't mean matched, but uh use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only?\nphd b: Uh yes?\nphd a: Uh yeah, so this is basically this is in the table. Uh so the number is fifty - two,\nphd b: Another table.\nphd a: uh \nprofessor d: Fifty - two percent.\nphd a: Fift - So No, it's it's the \nphd b: No.\nprofessor d: No, fifty - two percent of eighty - two?\nphd a: Of of of uh eighteen \nphd b: Eighty.\nphd a: of eighteen.\nphd b: Eighty.\nphd a: So it's it's error rate, basically.\nphd b: It's plus six.\nphd a: It's er error rate ratio. So \nprofessor d: Oh this is accuracy! \nphd a: Uh, so we have nine nine let's say ninety percent.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Oy! OK. Ninety.\nphd a: Yeah. Um which is uh what we have also if use PLP and MSG together,\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: eighty - nine point seven.\nprofessor d: OK, so even just PLP, uh, it is not, in the matched condition Um I wonder if it's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra, or whether it's that the net half, for some reason, is not helping.\nphd a: Uh. P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same same results.\nprofessor d: Same result pretty much?\nphd a: Well, we have these results. I don't know. It's not Do you have this result with PLP alone, j fee feeding HTK?\nprofessor d: So, s\nphd a: That That's what you mean?\nphd b: Yeah,\nphd a: Just PLP at the input of HTK.\nphd b: yeah yeah yeah yeah, at the first and the Yeah.\nphd a: Yeah. So, PLP \nprofessor d: Eighty - eight point six.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Um, so adding MSG\nphd a: Um \nprofessor d: um Well, but that's yeah, that's without the neural net,\nphd a: Yeah, that's without the neural net\nprofessor d: right?\nphd a: and that's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization.\nprofessor d: But she had said eighty - two.\nphd a: This is the w well, but this is without on - line normalization.\nprofessor d: Right? Oh, this the eighty - two.\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd b: \nphd a: Eighty - two is the it's the Aurora baseline, so MFCC. Then we can use well, OGI, they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization\nprofessor d: Oh, I 'm sorry, I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy.\nphd a: Yeah, sorry. Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. Alright.\nphd a: Yeah.\nprofessor d: Alright. So this is I was thinking all this was worse. OK so this is all better\nphd b: Yes, better.\nprofessor d: because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor d: OK. I 'm I 'm all better now. OK, go ahead.\nphd a: So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent.\nprofessor d: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\nphd a: Uh, when we apply a neural network, is the same. We j jump to ninety percent.\nphd b: Nnn, we don't know exactly.\nprofessor d: Yeah.\nphd a: And And um whatever the normalization, actually. If we use n neural network, even if the features are not correctly normalized, we jump to ninety percent. So \nprofessor d: So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety, or something.\nphd a: Well, ninety No, I I mean ninety It's around eighty - nine, ninety, eighty - eight.", "en_query": "What did PhD A think about the results?", "zh_query": "博士生A对这些结果有什么看法？", "fr_query": "Qu'a pensé Doctorat A des résultats ?", "ukr_query": "Що думав доктор філософії А про результати?", "en_summary": "PhD A thought that most of the nets are not that good, except for the multi English.

{"fname": "academic_dev_49", "dialogue": "professor a: Yeah. Yeah. So they would like clean channels. Uh and for that mmm uh that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out. So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that. So. OK. Right? Um. And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not, but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor a: Uh.\ngrad e: Um. So continuing to um extend\nphd b: What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing? And and S Shawn, yeah. Oh. So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features? I see.\nprofessor a: But that's uh uh all that's is a a certainly relevant uh study and, you know, what are the features that they 're finding. We have this problem with the overloading of the term \" feature \" so\nphd b: Yeah.\nprofessor a: uh what are the variables, what we 're calling this one, what are the variables that they 're found finding useful\nphd c: Hmm.\nprofessor a: um for \nphd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features.\nprofessor a: Right. And that's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what, I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying, do you ha still have that? Yeah.\ngrad e: Oh yeah.\nprofessor a: There's those that uh yeah, some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on uh what \" good features \" are and \nphd b: What does what did um Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant uh detector, right? How did he H how did he do that? Wh - what was his detector? Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Oh, OK. Mm - hmm. So how did he combine all these features? What what r mmm classifier did he Hmm. Oh right. You were talking about that, yeah. I see.\nprofessor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from. So I mean, there's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something, you know, more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation. But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database? This is the \nphd b: Hmm!\nprofessor a: And then tell them to talk naturally? Yeah, yeah.\nphd b: Pierced tongues and Yeah. You could just mount it to that and they wouldn't even notice. Weld it. Zzz.\nprofessor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could, you know you know have have, you know, reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements.\nphd b: Yeah. I That's right. You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know, transmitters in them and things\nprofessor a: Yeah. Yeah, be cool and help science.\nphd b: and Yeah.\nprofessor a: OK.\nphd b: Hmm! There's a bunch of data that l around, that people have done studies like that w way way back right? I mean I can't remember where uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah. I remember there was this guy at A T - andT, Randolph? or r What was his name? Do you remember that guy? Um, researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying, trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features. I can't remember what his name was. Dang. Now I 'll think of it. That's interesting.\nprofessor a: Do you mean eh but you I mean Mar\nphd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using \nprofessor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there, or?\nphd b: Mark Randolph.\nprofessor a: Yeah he's he's he's at Motorola now.\nphd b: Oh is he?\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd b: Oh OK.\nprofessor a: Yeah.\nphd b: Yeah.\nphd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or?\nphd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using, now. But I know I just remember it had to do with you know uh positional parameters\nphd c: What Yeah.\nphd b: and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Yeah. So the only the only uh hesitation I had about it since, I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it's it's continuous variables and a bunch of them. And so\nphd b: Hmm.\nprofessor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels, and just a few of them. And maybe there's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself, whereas um if you did something instead that like um having some manual annotation by uh you know, linguistics students, this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: but the things that you could do, like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: And then there would it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable. Course then, that's the other question is do you want binary variables. So. I mean the other thing you could do is boot trying to to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from uh the uh uh the data itself there, but I I 'm not sure \nphd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering?\nprofessor a: Guess you could, yeah.\nphd b: Bin them up into different categories and \nprofessor a: Yeah. So anyway that's that's uh that's another whole direction that cou could be looked at. Um. Um. I mean in general it's gonna be for new data that you look at, it's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and Um. So.\ngrad e: Right. Right.\nphd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones.\ngrad e: Right.\nphd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nphd b: I see.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: Yeah. So wh yeah, where this fits into the rest in in my mind, I guess, is that um we 're looking at different ways that we can combine uh different kinds of of rep front - end representations um in order to get robustness under difficult or even, you know, typical conditions. And part of it, this robustness, seems to come from uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it, at least for one one um articulatory feature. The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have, since I mean, one of the things that's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it um the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than um just assuming that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength towards uh it being this phone or that phone. Right? So it so um he's got these um uh uh\nphd b: Hmm.\nprofessor a: he \" AND's \" between these different features. It's a soft \" AND \", I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR's \" across the different soft \" OR's \" across the different uh multi - band channels. And um the weight yeah, the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that's kept uh as a hidden variable, and is learned with EM. Whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that\nphd b: So he doesn't have \nprofessor a: which means that it's it's uh i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to um uh train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band. You you wanna ignore that band, cuz that's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure.\nphd b: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up. In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting. Uh. Maybe that's not the right thing to do.\nphd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho\ngrad e: F right, and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels.\nprofessor a: Well at the at the tail end, yeah, he has to know what's where it's sonorant. But he's but what he's - but what he's not training up uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is\ngrad e: Right. For the full band.\nprofessor a: um I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band? Is it sonorant in that band?\ngrad e: Right.\nprofessor a: Is it sonorant in that band? i It's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant. So\nphd b: Mm - hmm.

Check one.\ngrad a: And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by, uh, watching the little bars change.\ngrad b: So, which is my bar? Mah! Number one.\ngrad a: Yep.\ngrad e: Sibilance. Sibilance.\ngrad a: So, actually, if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now, as long as you 've signed the consent form, that's alright.\ngrad e: Are we supposed to read digits at the same time?\ngrad a: No. No.\ngrad e: Oh, OK.\ngrad a: Each individually. We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult. To try to read them while everyone else is.\ngrad e: Everyone would need extreme focus.\ngrad a: So, when you 're reading the digit strings, the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on.\nprofessor c: Other way. We m We may wind up with ver We we may need versions of all this garbage.\ngrad b: For our stuff. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Um. So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: So. You can see the transcript? There's two large number strings on the digits? So you would just read that one. And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines. And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins. And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first, so can see how that goes. Um. Again, I 'm not sure how much I should talk about stuff before everyone's here.\nprofessor c: Mmm. Well, we have one more coming.\ngrad a: OK. Well, why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there.\nprofessor c: OK. Well, we can start doing it.\ngrad a: Thanks. So, uh, just also a note on wearing the microphones. All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly, but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth, and then, at the corner. And that's so that you minimize breath sounds, so that when you 're breathing, you don't breathe into the mike. Um. Yeah, that's good. And uh So, everyone needs to fill out, only once, the speaker form and the consent form. And the short form I mean, you should read the consent form, but uh, the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts. So, if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public, which, these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them, uh, you 'll be given an opportunity by email, uh, to bleep out any portions you don't like. Um. On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can. If you 're not exactly sure about the region, we 're not exactly sure either. So, don't worry too much about it. The It's just self rating. Um. And I think that's about it. I mean, should I Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is?\nprofessor c: Um, yeah.\ngrad a: or?\nprofessor c: No. There was there was Let's see. Oh \ngrad e: Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here?\ngrad b: I sent an email.\nprofessor c: She got an emai she was notified.\ngrad e: Oh yeah, she got an e Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Whether she knows is another question. Um. So are the people going to be identified by name?\ngrad a: Well, what we 're gonna we 'll anonymize it in the transcript. Um, but not in the audio.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: So the\nprofessor c: OK. So, then in terms of people worrying about, uh, excising things from the transcript, it's unlikely. Since it it does isn't attributed. Oh, I see, but the a but the but the \ngrad a: Right, so if I said, \" Oh, hi Jerry, how are you? \", we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" Jerry \"s.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Sure.\ngrad a: Um, so we will go through and, in the speaker ID tags there 'll be, you know, M - one O seven, M - one O eight.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: Um, but uh,\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: um, it w uh, I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio, and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data.\nprofessor c: OK. Mm - hmm. No, I I wasn't complaining,\ngrad a: Yep.\nprofessor c: I just wanted to understand.\ngrad a: Right.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad b: Well, we can make up aliases for each of us.\ngrad a: Yeah, I mean, whatever you wanna do is fine,\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad a: but we find that We want the meeting to be as natural as possible. So, we 're trying to do real meetings.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad a: And so we don't wanna have to do aliases\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: and we don't want people to be editing what they say.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad a: So I think that it's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad b: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: You know?\nprofessor c: Right. Um, OK. So why don't you tell us briefly\ngrad a: OK. So th\nprofessor c: your give give your e normal schpiel.\ngrad a: Um. So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project. Um. So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future. This is a mock - up of one. Yes, we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood. Um. The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting, and record it, and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on, on the meeting. So that's my particular interest, is a portable device to do m uh, information retrieval on meetings. Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings. Um. So the first step on that, in any of these, is to collect some data. And so what we wanted is a room that's instrumented with both the table top microphones, and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes, as well as the close talking mikes. What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth, gives us, um, high quality audio, um, especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus. So, for people who are more interested in language, we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available. And then also, um, it's a very, very hard task in terms of speech recognition. Um. And so, uh, on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results. So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two. So that's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time. And then, all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like, um, beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that. Our intention is to release this data to the public, um, probably through f through a body like the LDC. And, uh, just make it as a generally available corpus. Um. There's other work going on in meeting recording. So, we 're we 're working with SRI, with UW, Um. NIST has started an effort which will include video. We 're not including video, obviously. And uh and then also, um, a small amount of assistance from IBM. Is also involved. Um. Oh, and the digit strings, this is just a more constrained task. Um. So because the general environment is so challenging, we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier. And it's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits, which is a common connected digits corpus. So we 'll have some, um, comparison to be able to be made.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad a: Anything else?\nprofessor c: No.\ngrad a: OK, so when the l last person comes in, just have them wear a wireless. It should be on already. Um. Either one of those. And uh, read the digit strings and and fill out the forms. So, the most important form is the consent form, so just be s be sure everyone signs that, if they consent.\ngrad b: I 'm sure it's pretty usual for meetings that people come late,\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad b: so you will have to leave what you set.\ngrad a: Right. And uh, just give me a call, which, my number's up there when your meeting is over.\nprofessor c: Yep.\ngrad a: And I 'm going to leave the mike here but it's n Uh, but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one. It 'll just be sitting here.\ngrad b: Input? Yeah. There we go.\nprofessor c: By the way, Adam, we will be using the, uh, screen as well.\ngrad b: Yep.\nprofessor c: So, you know. Wow! Organization. So you guys who got email about this oh f uh, Friday or something about what we 're up to.\ngrad e: No.\ngrad f: No.\ngrad b: I got it.\ngrad e: What was the nature of the email?\nprofessor c: Oh, this was about um, inferring intentions from features in context, and the words, like \" s go to see \", or \" visit \", or some\ngrad b: Wel - we I uh I I \nprofessor c: You didn't get it?\ngrad e: I don't think I did.\nprofessor c: I guess these g have got better filters.

{"fname": "academic_dev_29", "dialogue": "grad e: Oh. OK, sure. So, um, last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach. And, um, we we got an improvement, uh, in word error rate, training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of, um, six percent to four point five percent, um, on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F, but, um, the near - mike performance worsened, um, from one point two percent to two point four percent. And, um, wh why would that be, um, considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK? And so, uh, with some input from, uh, Andreas, I have a theory in two parts. Um, first of all HTK sorry, SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation, and so HTK wasn't. Um, so this, um This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case. And also, um, the Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters. It's got finer - grained acoustic models. So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio. Um. And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background. And so that seems like it could be difficult for training, cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone, um, depending on the timing of the echo. So, um, I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set, and then, eh, the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them. So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of, um, read speech, and, um Hmm.\nprofessor b: I had another thought just now, which is, uh, remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about, uh, this stuff that some of the other stuff that Avendano did, where they were, um, getting rid of low - energy sections? Um, uh, if you if you did a high - pass filtering, as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation, uh, uh, Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that, uh, perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values, and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum. So, what what Hirsch did was, uh, set them to zero set the negative values to zero. So if you imagine a a waveform that's all positive, which is the time trajectory of energy, um, and, uh, shifting it downwards, and then getting rid of the negative parts, that's essentially throwing away the low - energy things. And it's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible. You know, you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing. I mean, you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation, but because you have these non - causal windows, you 're getting these funny things coming in, uh, at n And, um, what if you did? I mean, there's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original, according to some equation. I mean, you also could, uh, just try to make it nicer.\ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: And one of the things you could do is, you could do some sort of VAD - like thing\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some, uh, very low or or near zero value. I mean, uh, I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are, uh \ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: or pre - echoes, whichever they are are are, uh, part of what's causing the problem, you actually could get rid of them.\ngrad e: Uh - huh.\nprofessor b: Be pretty simple. I mean, you do it in a pretty conservative way\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor b: so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech.\ngrad e: Hmm.\nphd g: Um, what is the reverberation time like there?\ngrad e: In thi in this room? Uh \nphd g: On, uh, the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like?\ngrad e: Y Yeah. I I I I don't know.\nprofessor b: So, it's this room.\nphd g: It's, uh \nprofessor b: It's it's this room.\nphd g: Oh, this room?\nprofessor b: So \nphd g: OK.\nprofessor b: so it's these are just microphone this micro close microphone and a distant microphone, he's doing these different tests on.\ngrad f: Oh.\nprofessor b: Uh, we should do a measurement in here. I g think we never have. I think it's I would guess, uh, point seven, point eight seconds f uh, R T\ngrad f: Hmm!\nprofessor b: something like that? But it's you know, it's this room.\nphd g: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So.\nphd g: OK. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh. But the other thing is, he's putting in w I was using the word \" reverberation \" in two ways. He's also putting in, uh, a he's taking out some reverberation, but he's putting in something, because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds, which are then being subtracted from the speech. And since, you know, what you subtract, sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you won't. And \nphd g: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away. Uh, and if it's a low energy compo portion, you might actually hear some funny things.\nphd g: Yeah.\ngrad e: O o one thing, um, I noticed is that, um, the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized. So I was wondering, is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing, because yo\ngrad e: Yeah. I don't know why - y, uh, either.\nphd c: Yeah.\nprofessor b: I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Oh, OK.\nprofessor b: Yeah. I mean, I think if you really have louder signals, what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio.\nphd c: Well, well \nprofessor b: So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio, then it would be better.\nphd c: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio \ngrad e: It w i i it wouldn't affect things.\nprofessor b: No.\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad e: OK.\nphd c: Well, the system is use the absolute energy, so it's a little bit dependent on on the signal level. But, not so much, I guess.\nprofessor b: Well, yeah. But it's trained and tested on the same thing.\nphd c: Mmm.\nprofessor b: So if the if the if you change in both training and test, the absolute level by a factor of two, it will n have no effect.\nphd c: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nphd a: Did you add this data to the training set, for the Aurora? Or you just tested on this?\ngrad e: Uh Um. Did I w what?\nphd a: Well, Morgan was just saying that, uh, as long as you do it in both training and testing, it shouldn't have any effect.\ngrad e: Sorry? Yeah.\nphd a: But I I was sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data.\ngrad e: I I b\nphd a: You didn't train it also.\ngrad e: I Right. I trained on clean TI - digits. I I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits. But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder.\nprofessor b: Oh, I see.\ngrad e: I only remember noticing it made the, um, PZM signal louder.\nprofessor b: OK. Well, I don't understand then. Yeah.\ngrad e: Huh. I don't know. If it's if it's like, if it's trying to find a a reverberation filter, it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter. And then if you take it out that taking it out makes things louder. I mean.\nprofessor b: Uh, no. I mean, uh, there's there's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing,\ngrad e: Nuh - huh.\nprofessor b: uh, r uh, then I don't see how that would make it louder.\ngrad e: The mean. OK. Yeah, I see.\nprofessor b: So it might be just some \ngrad e: Yeah. OK. So I should maybe listen to that stuff again.\nprofessor b: Yeah. It might just be some artifact of the processing that that, uh, if you 're Uh, yeah. I don't know.\ngrad e: Oh. OK.\nphd a: I wonder if there could be something like, uh for s for the PZM data,\nphd c: Eh\nphd a: uh, you know, if occasionally, uh, somebody hits the table or something, you could get a spike. Uh. I 'm just wondering if there's something about the, um you know, doing the mean normalization where, uh, it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio. Um.\nprofessor b: Well, you know, there is this. Wait a minute. It it i maybe i If, um Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum. So, depending what you divide by, if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number, you could make it bigger.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: So, it's it's just a a question of there's It it could be that there's some normalization that's missing, or something to make it \ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor b: Uh, y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger, but maybe in practice it is. That's something to think about.\ngrad e: Hmm.\nprofessor b: I don't know.", "en_query": "Summarize the discussion on mean subtraction in SRI", "zh_query": "总结SRI中关于均值减法的讨论", "fr_query": "Résumer la discussion sur la soustraction moyenne dans le SRI ", "ukr_query": "Підведіть підсумки обговорення щодо віднімання середнього значення в SRI ", "en_summary": "The team got an improvement on the SRI system for TI- digits and Meeting Recorder digits but near mic performance worsened.

Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Um. So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: So. You can see the transcript? There's two large number strings on the digits? So you would just read that one. And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines. And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins. And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first, so can see how that goes. Um. Again, I 'm not sure how much I should talk about stuff before everyone's here.\nprofessor c: Mmm. Well, we have one more coming.\ngrad a: OK. Well, why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there.\nprofessor c: OK. Well, we can start doing it.\nprofessor c: Whether she knows is another question. Um.

{"fname": "academic_dev_33", "dialogue": "phd c: Um Well, I I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation, no cross - word models, no trigrams a bigram recognizer and that's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations. Um and thanks to Don's help wh who Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um you know separated used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes, up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that that's twenty minutes or so? Um yeah because I guess there's some,\ngrad e: Or so.\nphd c: and Don can talk to Jane about this, there's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier. Anyway so it's twenty minutes and I actually\ngrad e: Hmm.\nphd c: um\ngrad e: I was that did that did that recording have the glitch in the middle?\npostdoc g: I 'm puzzled by that. I oh oh, I see.\nphd c: There's there's a \npostdoc g: Oh there was a glitch somewhere.\nphd c: yeah, so that actually um\ngrad f: Was it twenty minutes in,\nphd c: if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know\npostdoc g: I forgot about that.\ngrad f: I thought \nphd a: Well it was interesting,\npostdoc g: Well, I mean, they \nphd a: suddenly the the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent\ngrad e: I don't remember when it is.\npostdoc g: but I was able to can transcribe\nphd a: but i looking at the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the it was actually recognized\nphd c: Wel\ngrad e: Oh no.\ngrad f: Yeah, that might be that might be that might be my fault.\npostdoc g: Wow.\nphd a: so\ngrad e: Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch.\ngrad f: I 'm not \nphd a: OK.\nphd c: No actually it was yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um\ngrad f: yeah, I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time,\npostdoc g: Oh. That's not good.\nphd c: Yeah\nphd a: OK.\nphd c: so that's what we have\ngrad e: Alright.\ngrad f: so\nphd c: but that that will be completely gone if this synch time problem\npostdoc g: Yeah.\ngrad e: The the glitch\nphd a: So so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever, up to that time to\npostdoc g: And the only glitch \ngrad e: yeah.\npostdoc g: yeah.\nphd c: So you guys know.\nprofessor b: S sorry I haven't seen the email,\nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad e: Th - the\npostdoc g: The the well wait\nprofessor b: what was the score?\nphd c: So here's the actual copy of the email\npostdoc g: we should say something about the glitch. He he can say something about the glitch.\nphd c: um oh OK\ngrad e: yeah.\npostdoc g: Cuz it's it's it's h it's it's very small \nphd c: so does this glitch occur at other \ngrad e: There there there's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized\npostdoc g: very small. Yep.\nphd c: Oh.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: Right.\ngrad e: so the that that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second\nprofessor b: Hmm.\ngrad f: Hmm.\ngrad e: and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there's a little part where it starts doing doing click sounds.\nprofessor b: So \nphd c: And is it only once that that happens?\ngrad e: But yeah\nphd c: OK.\ngrad e: it right once in the middle.\nphd c: There's the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong\nprofessor b: so so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice,\nphd c: but\ngrad e: Um But that shouldn't affect anything\nphd c: OK so that's actually\npostdoc g: S and it \nprofessor b: you see this here?\nphd c: It y it's \ngrad e: yeah yeah \" bah \"\nphd c: OK no \nphd a: Oh, and \nphd c: What happens is it actually affects the script that Don \nphd d: Huh.\nphd c: I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it\ngrad e: Well the acoustic one shouldn't do anything.\nphd c: but they\ngrad f: Yeah, I don't know exactly what affected it\npostdoc g: I agree. I agree.\nphd a: I I have \ngrad f: but I 'll I 'll talk to you about it,\nphd a: Yeah.\ngrad e: But I I do remember \nphd c: Yeah.\ngrad f: I 'll show you the point.\npostdoc g: Yeah. It it had no effect on my transcription,\nphd a: Mmm.\npostdoc g: you know, I mean I I had no trouble hearing it and and having time bins\ngrad e: I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect.\npostdoc g: but there was a Oh.\nphd c: Well, the the synch time the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should,\ngrad f: That's what happened.\npostdoc g: Oh.\nphd h: Yeah.\ngrad e: Where where they weren't monotonic.\ngrad f: There was yeah, I mean \nphd c: right? There's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame.\nphd h: Yeah.\npostdoc g: Oh, interesting.\nphd c: And so then, I mean you look at that and it's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right\ngrad e: Oh OK so that's\ngrad f: Hmm.\npostdoc g: Oh.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: so anyway it's it's just \ngrad e: yeah sounds like a bug.\npostdoc g: Yeah.\nphd c: that's why we only have twenty minutes but there's a significant amount of \ngrad f: Non - zero? Um there are like more cuz there's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran,\ngrad e: The other one I saw was that it yeah.\ngrad f: I mean but there were there was a point.\nphd c: Yeah that was fine. That that was OK.\ngrad e: The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad e: and that definitely indicra indicates a bug.\ngrad f: Uh.\nphd c: Well that would really be a problem, yeah. So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nphd c: um and what's which \ngrad e: So that's very encouraging.\nphd c: this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition,\nprofessor b: Hmm.\nphd h: Yeah.\nprofessor b: Cool.\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: there's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which\nphd d: Trent Lott.\nphd c: um I mean these are sort of funny ones,\nphd d: It 'll get those though.\nphd c: there's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references, I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see\ngrad e: I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: but um it's pretty good.\ngrad e: because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right?\nphd c: Well so I guess we can generate\ngrad e: Sounds likes?\nphd a: There are a fair number of errors that are, you know where got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong.\npostdoc g: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: um\ngrad e: Yeah, and who cares? And and there were lots of of course the \" uh uh \" - s, \" in on \" - s \" of uh \" - s.\nphd a: Mmm, so if \nphd c: there's No those are actually\nphd a: Yeah.\nphd c: a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: so is it like PZM is three words, it's PZM,\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: I mean there's nothing There's no language model for PZM or\ngrad e: Right. Ri - ri right.\nphd c: um\ngrad e: Did you say there's no language for PZM?\nphd c: No language model, I mean those \ngrad e: Do you mean so every time someone says PZM it's an error? Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings.\nphd c: Well well there's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there \ngrad e: Yeah, that's right, Jimlet.\nprofessor b: Well, we don't even know what that means,\nphd c: so but this is really encouraging because\nprofessor b: so I\ngrad e: Yeah, that's right.\nphd c: so, I mean the bottom line is even though it's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained mostly trained recognizer\ngrad e: Right.\nphd c: and Switchboard - two is got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic\ngrad e: Excellent.\nphd c: and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that's great.\nprofessor b: Yeah. Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety - three workshop\nphd c: Um\nprofessor b: and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard.\nphd a: Mm - hmm.\nphd c: Oh yeah\nprofessor b: you know\nphd c: I mean this is really,\nphd a: Mmm.\nphd c: and thanks to Andreas who, I mean this is a\nphd a: Mmm.\ngrad e: Well especially for the very first run, I mean you ", "en_query": "Summarize what was said about the microphone data", "zh_query": "总结关于麦克风数据的相关讨论内容", "fr_query": "Résumer ce qui a été dit sur les données du microphone", "ukr_query": "Підсумуйте те, що було сказано про дані мікрофона", "en_summary": "The group discussed recognition results generated for 20 minutes of close-talking microphone data.

{"fname": "academic_dev_36", "dialogue": "grad b: what things to talk about.\ngrad f: I 'm What? Really? Oh, that's horrible! Disincentive!\ngrad a: OK, we 're recording.\ngrad f: Hello?\ngrad b: Check check check check.\ngrad d: Uh, yeah.\ngrad f: Hello? Which am I?\nprofessor c: Oh right.\ngrad b: Alright. Good.\ngrad f: Channel fi OK. OK. Are you doing something? OK, then I guess I 'm doing something. So, um, So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met, um, but not as much writing, um, is a sheet that I have a lot of, like, thoughts and justification of comments on but I 'll just pass out as is right now. So, um, here. If you could pass this around? And there's two things. And so one on one side is on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification.\ngrad d: Um The wait.\ngrad f: And the other side is, um, sort of a revised construction formalism.\ngrad e: This is just one sheet, right?\ngrad d: Ah! Just one sheet.\ngrad f: It's just one sheet.\ngrad d: OK.\ngrad f: It's just a Nothing else.\ngrad d: Front, back.\ngrad f: Um, Enough to go around? OK. And in some ways it's it's it's very similar to There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've, um, uh, b done before but I don't think everyone here has seen all of this. So, uh, I 'm not sure where to begin. Um, as usual the disclaimers are there are all these things are it's only slightly more stable than it was before.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And, um, after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days, um, it 'll probably change again some more.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Um, maybe I will let's start b let's start on number two actually on the notation, um, because that's, I 'm thinking, possibly a little more familiar to, um to people. OK, so the top block is just sort of a sort of abstract nota it's sort of like, um, listings of the kinds of things that we can have. And certain things that have, um, changed, have changed back to this. There there's been a little bit of, um, going back and forth. But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name. I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line.\nprofessor c: What I was gonna Right.\ngrad f: So something like, um Well, there's an example the textual example at the end has clausal construction. So, um, just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful It could be, you know, simple old text as well. Um, there are a couple of Uh, these three have various ways of doing certain things. So I 'll just try to go through them. So they could all have a type at the beginning. Um, and then they say the key word construction\nprofessor c: Oh, I see.\ngrad f: and they have some name.\nprofessor c: So so the current syntax is if it s if there's a type it's before construct\ngrad f: Yeah, right.\nprofessor c: OK, that's fine.\ngrad f: OK, and then it has a block that is constituents. And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only, um, tsk one type of constituent, that is a constructional constituent. I think that's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind. But in general instead of the word \" construct \", th here you might have \" meaning \" or \" form \" as well. OK? So if there's some element that doesn't that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning. OK, um, the main change with the constructs which each of which has, um, the key word \" construct \" and then some name, and then some type specification, is that it's it's pro it's often sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is. So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word \" throw \", or it's gonna be a form of the word, you know, I don't know, \" happy \", or something like that. Or, you know, some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type. You 'll say \" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here \" or \" I need a directional specifier here \". So - uh you could have a j a actual type here. Um, or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type. So a very common example of this is that, you know, in directed motion, the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind, often a human. Right? So if I you know, the um, uh, run down the street then I I I run down the street, it's typed, uh, \" I \", meaning category is what's there. The the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and, um, sort of skipping fonts and whatever. The idea is that sometimes there are, um, general constructions that you know, that you 're going to need. It's it's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase, or something like that there.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And usually it has formal um, considerations that will go along with it.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And then uh, you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about, about what meaning what specific meaning you want. So the example again at the bottom, which is directed motion, you might need a nominal expression to take the place of, you know, um, \" the big th \", you you know, \" the big the tall dark man \", you know, \" walked into the room \".\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it's nominal of some kind but in particular, that it's some kind of animate nominal, and which will apply just as well to like, you know, a per you know, a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression. Um, so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types. So. OK, then I don't think the, um at least Yeah. None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints? But you can refer to any of the, um, sort of available elements and scope, right? which here are the constructs, to say something about the relation. And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block, um, we dropped like the little F subscript. The F subscripts refer to the \" form \" piece of the construct.\nprofessor c: Good.\ngrad f: And I think that, um, in general it 'll be unambiguous. Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that. So so by saying if I just said \" Name one \" then that means name one formal and we 're talking about formal struc Which which makes sense. Uh, there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that, in which case you could just indicate \" here I mean the meaningful for some reason \". Right? Or Actually it's more often that, only to handle this one special case of, you know, \" George and Jerry walk into the room in that order \".\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form. But but s we 're not gonna really worry about that for right now and there are way We can be more specific if we have to later on. OK, and so in terms of the the relations, you know, as usual they 're before and ends. I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation but in form you might also have a value binding. You know, you could say that, um, you know, \" name - one dot \", t you know, \" number equals \", you know, a plural or something like that.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: There are certain things that are attribute - value, similar to the bindings below but I mean they 're just us usually they 're going to be value value fillers, right? OK, and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings. There was talk of changing the name of that. And Johno and I I you you and I can like fight about that if you like? but about changing it to \" semantic n effects \", which I thought was a little bit too order - biased\ngrad b: Well Th\ngrad f: and \" semantic bindings \", which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings. And so it was an issue whether constraints um, there were some linguists who reacted against \" constraints \", saying, \" oh, if it's not used for matching, then it shouldn't be called a constraint \". But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it's used for matching or not. Right? Cuz there are I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are, for actual, you know, sort of like modified constraining purposes.\nprofessor c: Well, you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy. So that whether or not it's used for matching or only for verification, I \ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah. It's used shouldn't matter, right? Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: s For sure. I mean, I don't know what, uh, term we want to use\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: but we don't want to \ngrad f: Yeah, uh, there was one time when when Hans explained why \" constraints \" was a misleading word for him.\nprofessor c: Yep.\ngrad f: And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why Johno thought it was a misleading term, which was just an interesting coincidence. Um, but, uh And so I was like, \" OK, well both of you don't like it?\nprofessor c: It's g it's gone.\ngrad f: Fine, we can change it \". But I I I 'm starting to like it again.\ngrad b: But \ngrad f: So that that's why  That's why I 'll stick with it.\ngrad a: Well, you know what?\ngrad f: So \ngrad a: If you have an \" if - then \" phrase, do you know what the \" then \" phrase is called?\nprofessor c: Th\ngrad f: What? Con - uh, a consequent?\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, but it's not an \" if - then \".\ngrad a: No, but \nprofessor c: I know. Anyway, so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put, you could put no word,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: just meaning. OK? And the then let \ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, that's true.\ngrad b: So that's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down down here?\ngrad f: Oh, oops! No. That was just a mistake of cut and paste from when I was going with it.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad f: So, I 'm sorry. I didn't mean that one's an in unintentional.\ngrad b: So this should be semantic and \ngrad f: Sometimes I 'm intentionally inconsistent\ngrad b: \ngrad f: cuz I 'm not sure yet. Here, I actually it was just a mistake.\ngrad b: Th - so this definitely should be \" semantic constraints \" down at the bottom?\ngrad e: Sure.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad b: OK.\ngrad f: Well, unless I go with \" meaning \" but i I mean, I kind of like \" meaning \" better than \" semantic \"\ngrad b: Or \nprofessor c: Oh, whatever.\ngrad f: but I think there's vestiges of other people's biases.\nprofessor c: Or wh That - b\ngrad f: Like \nprofessor c: Right. Minor min problem \ngrad f: Minor point.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad e: Extremely.\ngrad f: OK, um, so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information, ex than the top block. And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know, all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the, um uh, that you can give dual types. Oh, one thing I should mention is about \" designates \". I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well. So, um, strike out the M subscript on the middle block.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So basically now, um, this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change, which is that \" designates \" isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now.\nprofessor c: Good.\ngrad f: So we want s \" designates \" to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of, um, really important for say composition later on. So for instance, if some other construction says, you know, \" are you of type is this part of type whatever \", um, the \" designates \" tells you which sort of part is the meaning part. OK, so if you have like \" the big red ball \", you know, you wanna know if there's an object or a noun. Well, ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase.\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad f: Um, there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it's useful sometimes to talk about, um to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one, right? So the ball is the head of the phrase, \" the r the \", um, \" big red ball \", and the entity denoted by the word \" ball \" is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of, um, in interesting larger element.\nprofessor c: A a and the Yeah. And there's uh there's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head. And and this enables you to get that, if I understand you right.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Right, right.\ngrad e: That's the idea.\nprofessor c: Yeah yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: And, uh, you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language, you can refer to the head as a p the, you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: So that's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in.\nprofessor c: OK, so that all looks good. Let me Oh, w Oh. I don't know. Were you finished?\ngrad f: Um, there was a list of things that isn't included but you you can you can ask a question. That might @ @ it.\nprofessor c: OK. So, i if I understand this the aside from, uh, construed and all that sort of stuff, the the differences are mainly that, we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: or actually gone back to,\ngrad f: Right.\nprofessor c: if we go back far enough \ngrad f: Well, except for their construction meaning, so it's not clear that, uh Well, right now it's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type. So I don't know what a form type is.\nprofessor c: Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I 'm sorry, you 're right.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: A construction type. Uh, that's fine. But it, um \ngrad f: Right. A well, and a previous, um, you know, version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it. So you could say \" construct of type whatever designates something \".\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: But that was mostly for reference purposes, just to refer to the meaning pole. I don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning, which is really what we want most of the time I think.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Um, I I don't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h if there is a form category constraint, you could imagine having a triple there that says, you know that's kind of weird.\nprofessor c: No, no, no, I don't think so. I think that you 'll you 'll do fine.\ngrad e: I \nprofessor c: In fact, these are, um, as long as as Mark isn't around, these are form constraints. So a nominal expression is uh, the fact that it's animate, is semantic. The fact that it's n uh, a nominal expression I would say on most people's notion of of f you know, higher form types, this i this is one.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Right, right.\nprofessor c: And I think that's just fine.\ngrad e: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad f: Which is fine, yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: It's that now, um, I 'm mentioned this, I I don't know if I ever explained this but the point of, um, I mentioned in the last meeting, the point of having something called \" nominal expression \" is, um, because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for, you know, like say taking as its object just some expression which, um, designates an object or designates a thing, or whatever, um, that leads to some syntactic problems basically? So you wanna, you know you sort of have this problem like \" OK, well, I 'll put the word \", uh, let's say, the word \" dog \", you know. And that has to come right after the verb\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: cuz we know verb meets its object. And then we have a construction that says, oh, you can have \" the \" preceding a noun. And so you 'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: And you could get, you know, \" the kicked dog \" or something like that, meaning \" kicked the dog \".\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Um, so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there\nprofessor c: That I I have no problem with it at all.\ngrad e: but It - it\nprofessor c: I think it's fine.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah. Right, n s you may be you may not be like everyone else in in Berkeley,\ngrad e: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad f: but that's OK.\ngrad e: I mean, we we we sort of thought we were getting away with, uh with, a p\ngrad f: Uh, we don't mind either, so \ngrad e: I mean, this is not reverting to the X - bar theory of of phrase structure.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: But, uh,\ngrad f: Right.\ngrad e: I just know that this is Like, we didn't originally have in mind that, uh that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: But they do.\ngrad e: Um, but they does.\ngrad f: Well, there's an alternative to this\ngrad e: At least in English.\ngrad f: which is, um The question was did we want directed motion,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: which is an argument structure construction \nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: did we want it to worry about, um, anything more than the fact that it, you know, has semantic You know, it's sort of frame - based construction. So one option that, you know, Keith had mentioned also was like, well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject, predicate, basically things like grammatical relations,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: those could intersect with these in such a way that subject, predicate, or subject, predicate, subject, verb, ob you know, verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way. But you know, for now, I mean,\nprofessor c: Yeah. But it y y it's yeah, just moving it moving the c the cons the constraints around.\ngrad f: uh, you know. M moving it to another place, right.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: OK, so that's \ngrad f: But there does basically, the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere, right?\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: So, yeah.\nprofessor c: And so that was the \ngrad f: Robert's not happy now?\ngrad a: No!\ngrad f: Oh, OK.\nprofessor c: OK, and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair.\ngrad f: Yes.\nprofessor c: Instead of just the meaning.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And that aside from some terminology, that's basically it.\ngrad f: Right.\nprofessor c: I just want to b I 'm I 'm asking.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Yep.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, um, the un sort of the un - addressed questions in this, um, definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: Here are just bindings but, right? we might want to introduce mental spaces You know, there's all these things that we don't \nprofessor c: The whole the mental space thing is clearly not here.\ngrad f: Right? So there's going to be some extra you know, definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: By the way, I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back.\ngrad f: Uh Yeah.\nprofessor c: So, uh, the the mental space thing.\ngrad f: OK.\nprofessor c: Um, obviously, construal is a b is a b is a big component of that\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back. But sort of as soon as he gets back I think um, we ought to \ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: So what's the what's the time frame? I forgot again when you 're going away for how long?\ngrad a: Just, uh, as a sort of a mental bridge, I 'm not I 'm skipping fourth of July. So, uh, right afterwards I 'm back.\ngrad e: OK. OK.\ngrad f: What? You 're missing like the premier American holiday? What's the point of spending a year here?\ngrad a: Uh, I 've had it often enough.\ngrad f: So, anyway.\ngrad b: Well he w he went to college here.\ngrad f: Oh, yeah, I forgot. Oops. Sorry.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: OK.\nprofessor c: And furthermore it's well worth missing.\ngrad f: Not in California.\ngrad e: Yes.\ngrad f: Yeah, that's true. I like I I like spending fourth of July in other countries, whenever I can.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: Um \nprofessor c: OK, so that's great.\ngrad f: Construal, OK, so Oh, so there was one question that came out. I hate this thing. Sorry. Um, which is, so something like \" past \" which i you know, we think is a very simple uh, we 've often just stuck it in as a feature,\nprofessor c: Right. Right.\ngrad f: you know, \" oh, this event takes place before speech time \", OK, is what this means. Um, it's often thought of as it is also considered a mental space,\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: you know, by, you know, lots of people around here.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: So there's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say \" in France, blah - blah - blah \",\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: and you have to build up you ha you would imagine that would require you, you know, to be very specific about the machinery, whereas past is a very conventionalized one and we sort of know what it means but it we doesn't don't necessarily want to, you know, unload all the notation every time we see that it's past tense.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: So, you know, we could think of our uh, just like X - schema \" walk \" refers to this complicated structure, past refers to, you know, a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it.\nprofessor c: I think that's exactly right.\ngrad f: So so we 're kind of like having our cake and eating it \nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: you know, having it both ways, right?\nprofessor c: Yeah. No, I think I think that i we 'll have to see how it works out when we do the details\ngrad f: So, i i Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: but my intuition would be that that's right.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Yeah, OK.\ngrad a: Do you want to do the same for space?\ngrad f: Wha - sorry?\ngrad a: Space?\ngrad f: Space?\ngrad a: Here? Now?\ngrad f: Oh, oh, oh, oh, instead of just time?\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same thing. So there are very conventionalized like deictic ones, right? And then I think for other spaces that you introduce, you could just attach y whatever \ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad f: You could build up an appropriately uh, appropriate structure according to the l the sentence.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad a: Hmm, well this this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your C dot something \ngrad e: N\ngrad a: you know, where where it's contextually dependent,\ngrad f: Yeah. Right.\ngrad a: \" what is now, what was past,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: what is in the future, where is this, what is here, what is there, what is \"\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Yeah. So time and space. Um, we 'll we 'll get that on the other side a little, like very minimally. There's a sort of there's a slot for setting time and setting place.\nprofessor c: Good.\ngrad f: And you know, you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place, and then there are many in more interestingly, linguistically anyway, there are relative things that, you know, you relate the event in time and space to where you are now. If there's something a lot more complicated like, or so hypothetical or whatever, then you have to do your job,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: like or somebody's job anyway.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: I 'm gonna point to at random.\ngrad e: Yeah. I mean, I 'm I 'm s curious about how much of the mental I mean, I 'm not sure that the formalism, sort of the grammatical side of things, is gonna have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff. You know, um, basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of I think of it as, sort of giving you the coordinates of, you know assuming that at any point in discourse there's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios, whatever, and the speaker's supposed to be keeping track of those. The, um the construction that you actually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going, um, you 're supposed to add structure to.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: So \" in France, uh, Watergate wouldn't have hurt Nixon \" or something like that. Um, well, you say, \" alright, I 'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past France universe \" or something like that. The information in the sentence tells you that much but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is. So for example, depending on the linguistic con uh, context it could be like the question is for example, what does \" Watergate \" refer to there? Does it, you know does it refer to, um if you just hear that sentence cold, the assumption is that when you say \" Watergate \" you 're referring to \" a Watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France \". But in a different context, \" oh, you know, if Nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't you know, Watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the US and in France it wouldn't have hurt him at all \". Now we 're s now that \" Watergate \" we 're now talking about the real one,\ngrad f: They 're real, right.\ngrad e: and the \" would \" sort of it's a sort of different dimension of hypothe - theticality, right? We 're not saying What's hypothetical about this world.\ngrad f: I see right.\ngrad e: In the first case, hypothetically we 're imagining that Watergate happened in France.\ngrad f: Hmm.\ngrad e: In the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: or something. Right?\ngrad f: Right.\ngrad e: So a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level.\nprofessor c: Correct.\ngrad e: Uh, um, and so \ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: I don't know where that sits then,\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad e: sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant.\ngrad f: It seems like, um, the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals, whatever, give you sort of the the most basi\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: th those we I think we can figure out what the possibilities are, right?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: There are sort of a relatively limited number. And then how they interact with some extra thing like \" in France \" or \" if such - and - such \", that's like there are certain ways that they c they can \ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: You know, one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat grammar gives you.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: I think. But, you know, whatever,\nprofessor c: Yeah, in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going.\ngrad f: we we 're \ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, I uh, you you \ngrad e: But the whole point of the whole point of what Fauconnier and Turner have to say about, uh, mental spaces, and blending, and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence. You know, there's not that much information contained in the sentence. It just says, \" Here. Add this structure to this space. \" and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open. An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on, quote, \" what the space configuration is at the time of utterance \".\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And so somebody's gonna have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me, I think.\nprofessor c: Well I think that's right. Oh, I yeah, I, uh, uh I think that's Not k I th I don't think it's completely right. I mean, in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b the form did constrain the meaning,\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and so, um, it isn't, uh \ngrad e: Sure, but like what what was the point of saying that sentence about Nixon and France? That is not there is nothing about that in the in the sentence really.\ngrad f: That's OK. We usually don't know the point of the sentence at all.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: But we know what it's trying to say.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: Y yeah.\ngrad f: We we know that it's what predication it's setting up.\nprofessor c: But but bottom line, I agree with you,\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: That's all.\nprofessor c: that that that we 're not expecting much out of the, uh f\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Purely linguistic cues, right?\nprofessor c: uh, the purely form cues, yeah.\ngrad f: So.\nprofessor c: And, um I mean, you 're you 're the linguist\ngrad f: Mmm.\nprofessor c: but, uh, it seems to me that th these we we you know, we 've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something.\ngrad e: Yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah, I mean \ngrad e: Yeah. Oh, yeah.\nprofessor c: uh, I I mean, that that's my feeling that that these are really hard uh, problems that decide exactly what what's going on.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Yeah. Yeah.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad f: OK, so, um, one other thing I just want to point out is there's a lot of confusion about the terms like \" profile, designate, focus \", et cetera, et cetera.\nprofessor c: Uh, right, right, right.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Um, for now I 'm gonna say like \" profile \"'s often used like two uses that come to mind immediately. One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else. So \" hypotenuse \", you profiled this guy against the background of the right t right triangle.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: OK. And the second use, um, is in FrameNet. It's slightly different. Oh, I was asking Hans about this. They use it to really mean, um, this in a frame th this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required. So they have to be there or expressed in some way. Which which I 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive but they 're they 're different meanings.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So the closest thing so I was thinking about how it relates to this notation. For us, um OK, so how is it \nprofessor c: Does that Is that really what they mean in in \ngrad f: so \" designate \" FrameNet?\nprofessor c: I didn't know that.\ngrad f: FrameNet? Yeah, yeah. I I mean, I I was a little bit surprised about it too.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: I knew that I thought that that would be something like there's another term that I 've heard for that thing\nprofessor c: Right, OK.\ngrad f: but they I mean uh, well, at least Hans says they use it that way. And \nprofessor c: Well, I 'll check.\ngrad f: and may maybe he's wrong. Anyway, so I think the the \" designate \" that we have in terms of meaning is really the \" highlight this thing with respect to everything else \". OK?\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: So this is what what it means. But the second one seems to be useful but we might not need a notation for it? We don't have a notation for it but we might want one. So for example we 've talked about if you 're talking about the lexical item \" walk \", you know it's an action. Well, it also has this idea it carries along with it the idea of an actor or somebody's gonna do the walking. Or if you talk about an adjective \" red \", it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red. So we used to use the notation \" with \" for this\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: and I think that's closest to their second one. So I d don't yet know, I have no commitment, as to whether we need it. It might be it's the kind of thing that w a parser might want to think about whether we require you know, these things are like it's semantically part of it \nprofessor c: N no, no. Well, uh, th critically they 're not required syntactically. Often they 're pres presu presupposed and all that sort of stuff.\ngrad f: Right. Right, right. Yeah, um, definitely. So, um, \" in \" was a good example. If you walk \" in \", like well, in what?\nprofessor c: Right, there's \ngrad f: You know, like you have to have the  So so it's only semantically is it it is still required, say, by simulation time though\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: to have something. So it's that I meant the idea of like that the semantic value is filled in by sim simulation. I don't know if that's something we need to spa to to like say ever as part of the requirement? or the construction? or not. We 'll we 'll again defer.\nprofessor c: Or I mean, or or, uh so the \ngrad f: Have it construed,\nprofessor c: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad f: is that the idea? Just point at Robert. Whenever I 'm confused just point to him.\nprofessor c: Right. It's it's his thesis, right?\ngrad f: You tell me.\nprofessor c: Anyway,\ngrad f: OK.\nprofessor c: right, yeah, w this is gonna be a b you 're right, this is a bit of in a mess and we still have emphasis as well, or stress, or whatever.\ngrad f: OK, well we 'll get, uh uh, I we have thoughts about those as well.\nprofessor c: Yeah. Great.\ngrad f: Um, the I w I would just s some of this is just like my you know, by fiat. I 'm going to say, this is how we use these terms. I don't - you know, there's lots of different ways in the world that people use it.\nprofessor c: I that's fine.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: I think that, um, the other terms that are related are like focus and stress.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So, s I think that the way I we would like to think, uh, I think is focus is something that comes up in, I mean, lots of basically this is the information structure.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: OK, it's like uh, it's not it might be that there's a syntactic, uh, device that you use to indicate focus or that there are things like, you know, I think Keith was telling me, things toward the end of the sentence, post - verbal, tend to be the focused focused element,\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad f: the new information. You know, if I \" I walked into the room \", you tend to think that, whatever, \" into the room \" is sort of like the more focused kind of thing.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\ngrad f: And when you, uh, uh, you have stress on something that might be, you know, a cue that the stressed element, or for instance, the negated element is kind of related to information structure. So that's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing. Uh, so so I think that's kind of nice to keep \" focus \" being an information structure term. \" Stress \" I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it. So, um, like \" stress \", th stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever, like, um, accent kind of stress.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And that's just a uh, w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device. You know, like, oh, high volume or whatever.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Um, t uh, and distinguish that from it's effect which is, \" Oh, the kind of focus we have is we 're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values \", right? So focus carries along a scope. Like if you 're gonna focus on this thing and you wanna know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Um, so my classic my now - classic example of saying, \" Oh, he did go to the meeting? \",\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: that was my way of saying as opposed to, you know, \" Oh, he didn't g \" or \" There was a meeting? \"\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: I think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: And so, um, the like if you said he you know, there's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you 're, c focusing, whatever, on, uh \ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: \" he walked to the meeting \" as opposed to \" he ran \", or \" he did walk to the meeting \" as opposed to \" he didn't walk \". You know,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: so we need to have a notation for that which, um, I think that's still in progress. So, sort of I 'm still working it out. But it did one one implication it does f have for the other side, which we 'll get to in a minute is that I couldn't think of a good way to say \" here are the possible things that you could focus on \", cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence, you know, or any meaning component of anyth you know all the possible meanings you could have, any of them could be the subject of focus.\nprofessor c: Mmm.\ngrad f: But I think one the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus, right? So for instance, you could say it's the the tense on this as opposed to, um, the the action. OK. Or it's uh, it's an identity thing or a contrast with other things, or stress this value as opposed to other things. So, um, it's it is kind of like a profile profile - background thing but I I can't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would that you would focu\ngrad e: Light up with focus, yeah.\ngrad f: light highlight as opposed to other ones. So it has some certain complications for the, uh, uh later on. Li - I mean, uh, the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements. For instance, you Oh, one other type that I forgot to mention is like query elements and that's probably relevant for the like \" where is \", you know, \" the castle \" kind of thing?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Because you might want to say that, um, location or cert certain WH words bring you know, sort of automatically focus in a, you know, \" I don't know the identity of this thing \" kind of way on certain elements. So. OK. Anyway. So that's onl there are there are many more things that are uncl that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation but it's most I think it's this is, you know, the current current form. Other things we didn't totally deal with, um,\ngrad e: Oh, there's a bunch.\ngrad f: well, we 've had a lot of other stuff that Keith and I have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: You know, a a nominal expression.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: And, um, I mean, we should have put an example of this and we could do that later.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: But I think the not inherently like the general principles still work though, that, um, we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like, you know, for instance, one Uh, you know, they they have constituents, right? So you can like nest things when you need to, but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way. So if you don't have like a lot of grammar experience, then like this this might, you know, be a little o opaque. But, you know, we have the properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents constituent - based grammar. So that's I think that's sort of the main thing we wanted to aim for\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: and so far it's worked out OK.\nprofessor c: Good.\ngrad f: So. OK.\ngrad a: I can say two things about the f\ngrad f: Yes.\ngrad a: Maybe you want to forget stress. This my f\ngrad f: As a word?\ngrad a: No, as as Just don't don't think about it.\ngrad f: As a What's that?\ngrad a: If \ngrad f: Sorry.\ngrad a: canonically speaking you can if you look at a a curve over sentence, you can find out where a certain stress is and say, \" hey, that's my focus exponent. \"\ngrad e: Right.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: It doesn't tell you anything what the focus is. If it's just that thing,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Or the constituent that it falls in.\ngrad a: a little bit more or the whole phrase.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Um \ngrad f: You mean t forget about stress, the form cue?\ngrad a: The form bit\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad a: because, uh, as a form cue, um, not even trained experts can always well, they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes.\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad a: And that's also mostly true for read speech. In in real speech, um, people may put stress. It's so d context dependent on what was there before, phrase ba breaks, um, restarts.\ngrad f: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: It's just, um it's absurd. It's complicated.\ngrad f: OK,\ngrad a: And all \ngrad e: Yeah, I mean, I I 'm sort of inclined to say let's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence\ngrad f: I believe you, yeah.\ngrad e: and then,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Ways that you can get it come from th\ngrad e: hhh, the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that.\ngrad f: right.\ngrad e: You know, I mean, later on we 'll worry about exactly how \ngrad a: Or or map from the contour to to what the focus exponent is.\ngrad e: y Yeah. Exactly.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: But figure out how the \ngrad a: But, uh, if you don't know what you 're what you 're focus is then you 're you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways,\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Right. That's fine, yeah. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: and the only way of figuring out what that is, is, um, by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element, decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: And then you 're left with a couple three. So, you know, again, that's something that h humans can do,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: um, but far outside the scope of of any anything. So. You know. It's \ngrad f: OK. Well, uh, yeah, I wouldn't have assumed that it's an easy problem in in absence of all the oth\ngrad a: u u\ngrad f: you need all the other information I guess.\ngrad a: But it's it's what it uh, it's pretty easy to put it in the formalism, though. I mean, because\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad a: you can just say whatever stuff, \" i is the container being focused or the the entire whatever, both, and so forth. \"\ngrad f: Mm - hmm, mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Yeah. Exactly. So the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture.\nprofessor c: Yeah, so b b but I think the poi I 'm not sure I understand but here's what I th think is going on. That if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches, it the fact that it matches, does in fact specify the focus.\ngrad f: W uh, I 'm not sure about that.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad f: Or it might limit it cert certainly constrains the possibilities of focus.\nprofessor c: Uh k uh, at at the very least it constrai\ngrad f: I think that's that's, th that's certainly true. And depending on the construction it may or may not f specify the focus, right?\nprofessor c: Oh, uh, for sure, yes. There are constrai yeah, it's not every but there are constructions, uh, where you t explicitly take into account those considerations\ngrad f: Yeah. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. So we talked about that a little bit this morning. \" John is on the bus, not Nancy. \"\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: So that's focuses on John.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: Hmm.\ngrad a: \" John is on the bus and not on the train. \"\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: \" John is on the bus \" versus \" John is on the train. \"\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: Right.\ngrad a: And \" John is on the bus \" versus \" was \", and e\ngrad f: Is on. \" John is on the bus \". Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad a: \" it's the bu \" so e\nprofessor c: Right. Yeah, all all of those.\ngrad a: All of these\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: Right.\ngrad a: and will we have u is it all the same constructions? Just with a different foc focus constituent?\ngrad f: Yeah, I would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of,\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: I don't know the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions. So that's why I was talking about overlapping constructions. So, then you have a separate thing that picks out, you know, stress on something relative to everything else.\nprofessor c: Yeah. So, the question is actually \ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: oh, I 'm sorry,\ngrad f: And it would \nprofessor c: go ahead,\ngrad f: yeah,\nprofessor c: finish.\ngrad f: and it w and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as, uh, whether it picks up that element, or the phrase, or something like that. But it's still is limited possibility.\ngrad a: Hmm.\ngrad f: So that should, you know, interact with it should overlap with whatever other construction is there.\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: S s the question is, do we have a way on the other page, uh, when we get to the s semantic side, of saying what the stressed element was, or stressed phrase, or something.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Well, so that's why I was saying how since I couldn't think of an easy like limited way of doing it, um, all I can say is that information structure has a focused slot\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: and I think that should be able to refer to \nprofessor c: So that's down at the bottom here when we get over there. OK.\ngrad f: Yeah, and, infer and I don't have I don't have a great way or great examples\nprofessor c: I 'll - I 'll wait. OK.\ngrad f: but I think that something like that is probably gonna be, uh, more more what we have to do.\ngrad a: Hmm.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad f: But, um,\ngrad a: So\ngrad f: OK, that was one comment. And you had another one?\ngrad a: Yeah, well the once you know what the focus is the everything else is background. How about \" topic - comment \" that's the other side of information.\ngrad f: How about what?\ngrad a: Topic - comment.\ngrad f: Yeah, so that was the other thing. And so I didn't realize it before. It's like, \" oh! \" It was an epiphany that it you know, topic and focus are a contrast set. So topic is Topic - focused seems to me like, um, background profile, OK, or a landmark trajector, or some something like that. There's there's definitely, um, that kind of thing going on.\ngrad a: Mmm.\ngrad f: Now I don't know whether I n I don't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions on like focus, right? Um, topic it seems kind of you know, I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Japanese has this though. You know.\ngrad f: Topic marker?\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah, that's what \" wa \" is, uh, just to mark which thing is the topic.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: It doesn't always have to be the subject.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Right. So again, information structure has a topic slot. And, you know, I stuck it in thinking that we might use it.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Um, I think I stuck it in.\nprofessor c: Yep, it's there.\ngrad f: Um, and one thing that I didn't do consistently, um, is when we get there, is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role. I think I have an idea of what it should be but th you know, so far we 've been getting away with like either a type constraint or, um, you know, whatever. I forg it 'll be a frame. You know, it 'll be it 'll be another predication or it 'll be, um, I don't know, some value from from some something, some variable and scope or something like that, or a slot chain based on a variable and scope. OK, so well that's should we flip over to the other side officially then?\ngrad a: Mm - hmm, hmm.\ngrad e: OK, side one.\ngrad f: I keep, uh, like, pointing forward to it. Yeah. Now we 'll go back to s OK, so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it, which is, um, the discourse situation context record, right? So I didn't I I meant just like draw a line and like, you know, you also have, uh, some tracking of what was going on.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: And sort of this is a big scale comment before I, you know, look into the details of this. But for instance you could imagine instead of having I I changed the name of um it used to be \" entities \". So you see it's \" scenario \", \" referent \" and \" discourse segment \". And \" scenario \" is essentially what kind of what's the basic predication, what event happened. And actually it's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture, a bunch of frames, bi and bindings, right? Um, and obviously there are other ones that are not included here, general cultural frames and general like, uh, other action f\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: you know, specific X - schema frames. OK, whatever. The middle thing used to be \" entities \" because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information. And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh, you know, about some entity that you were going to talk about. So \" Harry walked into the room \", \" Harry \" and \" room \", you know, the room th but they would be represented in this list somehow. And it could also have for instance, it has this category slot. Um, it should be either category or in or instance. Basically, it could be a pointer to ontology. So that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in. But the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number, gender, um ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that, um, you need to figure out wheth if it's a group whether, um, some event is happening, linear time, linear spaces, like, you know, are are they doing something serially or is it like, um, uh I 'm I 'm not sure. Because this partly came from, uh, Talmy's schema and I 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually. But Um, and then the \" status \" I used was like, again, in some languages, you know, like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status. So, th the the big com and and finally \" discourse segment \" is about sort of speech - act - y information structure - y, like utterance - specific kinds of things. So the comment I was going to make about, um, changing entity the entity's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse like situation context, you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to. And you might that might be sort of a general, I don't know, database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to. And I changed to \" reference \" cuz I would say, for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it. And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here. For instance, I know it's going to be plural. I know it's gonna be feminine or something like that. And and these could actually just point to, you know, the the ID in my other list of enti active entities, right? So, um, uh, th there's there's all this stuff about discourse status. We 've talked about. I almost listed \" discourse status \" as a slot where you could say it's active. You know, there's this, um, hierarchy uh there's a schematization of, you know, things can be active or they can be, um, accessible, inaccessible.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: It was the one that, you know, Keith, um, emailed to us once, to some of us, not all of us. And the thing is that that I noticed that that, um, list was sort of discourse dependent. It was like in this particular set, s you know, instance, it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been,\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not active.\nprofessor c: This Uh yeah, well there there seems to be context properties.\ngrad f: So.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, they 're contex and for instance, I used to have a location thing there but actually that's a property of the situation. And it's again, time, you know at cert certain points things are located, you know, near or far from you\nprofessor c: Well, uh, uh, this is recursive\ngrad f: and \nprofessor c: cuz until we do the uh, mental space story, we 're not quite sure  Th - th\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: which is fine. We 'll just we 'll j\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah. So some of these are, uh \nprofessor c: we just don't know yet.\ngrad f: Right. So I so for now I thought, well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance, right? Everything else here is utterance - specific. Um, and I left the slot, \" predications \", open because you can have, um, things like \" the guy I know from school \".\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Or, you know, like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know, predications that you might make. And it's unclear whether I mean, you could just have in your scenario, \" here are some extra few things that are true \", right?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And then you could just sort of not have this slot here. Right? You 're but but it's used for identification purposes.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: So it's it's a little bit different from just saying \" all these things are true from my utterance \".\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Um.\ngrad e: Right, \" this guy I know from school came for dinner \" does not mean, um, \" there's a guy, I know him from school, and he came over for dinner \". That's not the same effect.\ngrad f: Yeah, it's a little bit it's a little bit different. Right? So Or maybe that's like a restrictive, non - restrictive \ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: you know, it's like it gets into that kind of thing for um, but maybe I 'm mixing, you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So you might imagine that the information you pass to, you know in identifying a particular referent would be, \" oh, some \" you know, \" it's a guy and it's someone I know from school \".\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: So maybe that would, you know, be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the, whatever, construal engine or whatever, discourse context, to find you know, either create this reference,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: in which case it 'd be created here, and you know, so so you could imagine that this might not So, uh, I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things.\ngrad a: But to make it m precise at least in my mind, uh, it's not precise.\ngrad f: Um.\ngrad a: So \" house \" is gender neuter? In reality\ngrad f: Um, it could be in \ngrad a: or in \nprofessor c: Semantically.\ngrad a: semantically.\ngrad f: semantically, yeah. Yeah.\ngrad a: So \ngrad f: So it uh, uh, a table. You know, a thing that c doesn't have a gender. So. Uh, it could be that I mean, maybe you 'd maybe not all these I mean, I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things.\ngrad a: No, just to make sure that we everybody that's completely agreed that it it has nothing to do with, uh, form.\ngrad f: Yeah. OK, that is semantic as opposed to Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Um.\ngrad a: Then \" predications \" makes sense to to have it open for something like, uh, accessibility or not.\ngrad f: S so again Open to various things.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad f: Right. OK, so. Let's see. So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment, should I just go through each of these slots uh, each of these blocks, um, a little bit?\ngrad e: Sure.\ngrad f: Um, mostly the top one is sort of image schematic. And just a note, which was that, um s so when we actually ha so for instance, um, some of them seem more inherently static, OK, like a container or sort of support - ish. And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like \" source, path, goal \" is often thought of that way or \" force \", or something like that. But in actual fact, I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that. And different X - schemas use them in a way that's either static or dynamic. So \" path \", you could just be talking about the path between this and this.\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad f: And you know, \" container \" that you can go in and out. All of these things. And so, um, I think this came up when, uh, Ben and I were working with the Spaniards, um, the other day the \" Spaniettes \", as we called them um, to decide like how you want to split up, like, s image schematic contributions versus, like, X - schematic contributions. How do you link them up. And I think again, um, it's gonna be something in the X - schema that tells you \" is this static or is this dynamic \". So we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that. Um, that, you know, is it, uh, a state or is it a change of state, or is it a, um, action of some kind?\ngrad a: Uh, i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't?\ngrad f: Uh. Yeah.\ngrad a: Just means \ngrad f: Oh, oh! You mean, in the slot?\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Um, no, it's like X - sc it's it's like I was thinking of type constraints but X - schema, well it obviously has to be an X - schema. \" Agent \", I mean, the the performer of the X - schema, that s depends on the X - schema. You know, and I in general it would probably be, you know \ngrad e: So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were.\ngrad f: Yeah, basically.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad f: Um, \" aspectual type \" probably isn't obvious but I should have So, I just neglected to stick something in. \" Perspective \", \" actor \", \" undergoer \", \" observer \", um,\ngrad b: Mmm.\ngrad f: I think we 've often used \" agent \", \" patient \", obser\ngrad e: \" Whee! \" That's that one, right?\ngrad f: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Um, and so one nice thing that, uh, we had talked about is this example of like, if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know definitely, it is one way to for you to, you know, specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object. And so then we talked about, you know, whether well, does that specify topic as well? Well, maybe there are other things. You know, now that it's subject is more like a topic. And now that, you know Anyway. So. Sorry. I 'm gonna trail off on that one cuz it's not that f important right now.\nprofessor c: N now, for the moment we just need the ability to l l write it down if if somebody figured out what the rules were.\ngrad f: Um, To know how Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: Um, some of these other ones, let's see. So, uh, one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So polarity, uh, is using for like action did not take place for instance. So by default it 'll be like \" true \", I guess, you know, if you 're specifying events that did happen. You could imagine that you skip out this you know, leave off this polarity, you know, not don't have it here. And then have it part of the speech - act in some way.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: There's some negation. But the reason why I left it in is cuz you might have a change of state, let's say, where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold, and you 're just talking, you know if you 're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that, you know, whatever, the holder doesn't and \nprofessor c: No, I th I think at this lev which is it should be where you have it.\ngrad f: OK, it's so it's it's it's fine where it is.\nprofessor c: I mean, how you get it may may in will often involve the discourse\ngrad f: So, OK. May come from a few places.\nprofessor c: but but by the time you 're simulating you sh y you should know that.\ngrad f: Right. Right.\ngrad e: So, I 'm still just really not clear on what I 'm looking at. The \" scenario \" box, like, what does that look like for an example? Like, not all of these things are gonna be here.\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Correct.\ngrad e: This is just basically says\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. It's a grab bag of \ngrad e: \" part of what I 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh, schemas, image, and X - schemas. Here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there \".\ngrad f: So that's exactly what it is.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad f: And for a particular instance which I will, you know, make an example of something, is that you might have an instance of container and path, let's say, as part of your, you know, \" into \" you know, definition.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So you would eventually have instances filled in with various various values for all the different slots.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: And they 're bound up in, you know, their bindings and and and values.\nprofessor c: W it c\ngrad e: OK. Do you have to say about the binding in your is there a slot in here for that tells you how the bindings are done?\nprofessor c: No, no, no. I let's see, I think we 're we 're not I don't think we have it quite right yet. So, uh, what this is,\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: let's suppose for the moment it's complete. OK, uh, then this says that when an analysis is finished, the whole analysis is finished, you 'll have as a result, uh, some s resulting s semspec for that utterance in context,\ngrad e: OK. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: which is made up entirely of these things and, uh, bindings among them. And bindings to ontology items.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So that that the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So that's A. But B, which is more relevant to your life, is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions.\ngrad e: OK. Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So this is an that anything you have, in the party line, anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes, from pieces of this ignoring li\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: I mean, in general, you ignore lots of it.\ngrad e: Right.\nprofessor c: But it's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: Uh, so that the, you know, goal of the, uh uh, \" source, path, goal \" has to be the landmark of the conta you know, the interior of this container.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Or whate whatever.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So those constraints appear in constructions\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad f: Except for \" cause \", that I forgot. But anyway, there's som some kind of causal structure for composite events.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: OK, good. Let's let's mark that. So we need a c\ngrad f: Uh, I mean, so it gets a little funny. These are all so far these structures, especially from \" path \" and on down, these are sort of relatively familiar, um, image schematic kind of slots. Now with \" cause \", uh, the fillers will actually be themselves frames. Right?\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: So you 'll say, \" event one causes event B \nprofessor c: And and and and this this this again may ge our, um and we and and, of course, worlds.\ngrad f: uh, event two \", and \ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Yeah. So that's, uh these are all implicitly one within, uh within one world. Um, even though saying that place takes place, whatever. Uh, if y if I said \" time \" is, you know, \" past \", that would say \" set that this world \", you know, \" somewhere, before the world that corresponds to our current speech time \".\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. Yeah.\ngrad f: So. But that that that's sort of OK. The the within the event it's st it's still one world. Um. Yeah, so \" cause \" and Other frames that could come in I mean, unfortunately you could bring in say for instance, um, uh, \" desire \" or something like that,\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: like \" want \". And actually there is right now under \" discourse segments \", um, \" attitude \"?\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: \" Volition \"? could fill that. So there are a couple things where I like, \" oh, I 'm not sure if I wanted to have it there\ngrad e: Well that's \ngrad f: or \" Basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed. And, like, well, I don't you know, it was like \" hope, wish. desire \",\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Uh - huh.\ngrad f: blah - blah - blah. And it's like, well, I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place. So They 're more lexically marked, right?\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad f: At least in English. So if I wanted to I would stick in an extra frame in my meaning, saying, e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them, right? You know, like \" Naomi wants wants su a certain situation and that situation itself is a state of affairs \".\nprofessor c: S right. So so, \" want \" itself can be  i i i i i\ngrad f: u Can be just another frame that's part of your \nprofessor c: Well, and it i basically it's an action. In in our s in our in our \ngrad f: Yeah. Situation. Right, right.\nprofessor c: in in our in our s terminology, \" want \" can be an action and \" what you want \" is a world.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Hmm.\nprofessor c: So that's I mean, it's certainly one way to do it.\ngrad f: Mmm.\nprofessor c: Yeah, there there are other things.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Causal stuff we absolutely need. Mental space we need.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: The context we need. Um, so anyway, Keith So is this comfortable to you that, uh, once we have this defined, it is your tool kit for building the semantic part of constructions.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And then when we combine constructions semantically, the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And that's the wh and and I mean, that according to the party line, that's the whole story.\ngrad e: Yeah. Mm - hmm. Yeah. Um. y Right. That makes sense. So I mean, there's this stuff in the off in the scenario, which just tells you how various what schemas you 're using and they 're how they 're bound together. And I guess that some of the discourse segment stuff is that where you would sa\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: I mean, that's OK, that's where the information structure is which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of, um, of this.\ngrad f: Right. Exactly.\ngrad e: I mean, what's interesting is that the information structure stuff Hmm. There's almost I mean, we keep coming back to how focus is like this this, uh, trajector - landmark thing.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad e: So if I say, um, You know, \" In France it's like this \". You know, great, we 've learned something about France but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast, like \" In France it's like this \". And therefore you 're supposed to say, \" Boy, life sure \"\ngrad f: Right.\ngrad e: You know, \" in France kids are allowed to drink at age three \". And w you 're that's not just a fact about France. You also conclude something about how boring it is here in the U S. Right?\ngrad f: Right, right.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: And so \ngrad f: S so I would prefer not to worry about that for right now\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad f: and to think that there are, um,\ngrad e: That comes in and, uh \ngrad f: discourse level constructions in a sense, topic topic - focus constructions that would say, \" oh, when you focus something \" then \ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Yeah.\ngrad f: just done the same way just actually in the same way as the lower level. If you stressed, you know, \" John went to the \", you know, \" the bar \" whatever, you 're focusing that\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: and a in a possible inference is \" in contrast to other things \".\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: So similarly for a whole sentence, you know, \" in France such - and - such happens \".\ngrad e: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\ngrad f: So the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad a: Uh, just just, uh, look read uh even sem semi formal Mats Rooth.\ngrad f: I mean Yeah.\ngrad a: If you haven't read it. It's nice.\ngrad f: Uh - huh.\ngrad a: And just pick any paper on alternative semantics.\ngrad f: Uh - huh.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad a: So that's his that's the best way of talking about focus, is I think his way.\ngrad e: OK, what was the name?\ngrad a: Mats. MATS. Rooth.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad a: I think two O's, yes, TH.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad a: I never know how to pronounce his name because he's sort of,\nprofessor c: S Swede?\ngrad a: uh, he is Dutch\nprofessor c: Dutch?\ngrad a: and, um but very confused background I think.\nprofessor c: Oh, Dutch.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh - huh.\ngrad a: So and, um,\ngrad e: Mats Gould.\ngrad a: And sadly enough he also just left the IMS in Stuttgart. So he's not there anymore.\ngrad e: Hmm.\ngrad a: But, um I don't know where he is right now but alternative semantics is if you type that into an, uh, uh, browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff.\ngrad e: OK. OK. OK, thanks.\ngrad a: And what I 'm kind of confused about is is what the speaker and the hearer is is sort of doing there.\ngrad f: So for a particular segment it's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation, right? So for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad f: Um, hearer is a little bit harder. It could be like multiple people. I guess that that that that's not very clear from here \ngrad a: Yeah, but you Don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place,\ngrad f: I mean, that's not allowed here.\ngrad a: because \" you \", \" me \", \" he \", \" they \", you know, \" these guys \", all these expressions, nuh, are in in much the same way contextually dependent as \" here, \" and \" now, \" and \" there \" \ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Now, this is this is assuming you 've already solved that.\ngrad f: Ye - yeah.\nprofessor c: So it's it's Fred and Mary,\ngrad f: So th\nprofessor c: so the speaker would be Fred and the \ngrad a: Ah!\ngrad f: Right, so the constructions might of course will refer, using pronouns or whatever.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: In which case they have to check to see, uh, who the, uh, speaker in here wa in order to resolve those. But when you actually say that \" he walked into \", whatever, um, the \" he \" will refer to a particular You you will already have figured who \" he \" or \" you \", mmm, or \" I \", maybe is a bett better example, who \" I \" refers to. Um, and then you 'd just be able to refer to Harry, you know, in wherever that person whatever role that person was playing in the event.\ngrad a: Mmm. That's up at the reference part.\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad a: And down there in the speaker - hearer part?\ngrad f: S so, that's I think that's just n for instance, Speaker is known from the situation, right? You 're when you hear something you 're told who the speaker is I mean, you know who the speaker is. In fact, that's kind of constraining how in some ways you know this before you get to the you fill in all the rest of it. I think.\nprofessor c: Mmm.\ngrad f: I mean, how else would you um \ngrad a: You know, uh, uh, it's the speaker may in English is allowed to say \" I. \"\nprofessor c: Yeah. Well, here \ngrad a: Uh, among the twenty - five percent most used words.\ngrad f: Yeah. Right.\ngrad a: But wouldn't the \" I \" then set up the the s s referent that happens to be the speaker this time\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: and not \" they, \" whoever they are.\ngrad f: Right, right.\ngrad a: Or \" you \" \ngrad f: So \ngrad a: much like the \" you \" could n\ngrad f: S so OK, so I would say ref under referent should be something that corresponds to \" I \". And maybe each referent should probably have a list of way whatever, the way it was referred to. So that's \" I \" but, uh, uh, should we say it it refers to, what? Uh, if it were \" Harry \" it would refer to like some ontology thing. If it were if it's \" I \" it would refer to the current speaker, OK, which is given to be like, you know, whoever it is.\ngrad a: Well, not not always. I mean, so there's \" and then he said, I w \" Uh - huh.\nprofessor c: Uh \ngrad f: \" I \" within the current world.\ngrad a: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah. That's right. So so again, this uh, this this is gonna to get us into the mental space stuff\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nprofessor c: and t because you know, \" Fred said that Mary said \", and whatever.\ngrad e: Mmm.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And and so we 're, uh gonna have to, um, chain those as well.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Twhhh - whhh. But \ngrad f: Mm - hmm. So this entire thing is inside a world,\nprofessor c: Right. Right.\ngrad f: not just like the top part.\nprofessor c: I I think, uh \ngrad f: That's \ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Except s it's it's trickier than that because um, the reference for example So he where it gets really tricky is there's some things,\ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: and this is where blends and all terribl So, some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't.\ngrad f: Yeah. Right.\nprofessor c: And again, all we need for the moment is some way to say that.\ngrad f: Right. So I thought of having like for each referent, having the list of of the things t with which it is identified. You know, which which, uh you know, you you you \nprofessor c: You could do that.\ngrad f: for instance, um So, I guess, it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it's identifiable already or it's a new thing.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: If it's a new thing you 'd have to like create a structure or whatever. If it's an old thing it could be referring to, um, usually w something in a situation, right? Or something in ontology.\nprofessor c: uh - huh.\ngrad f: So, there's a you know, whatever, it c it could point at one of these.\nprofessor c: I just had a I just had an an idea that would be very nice if it works.\ngrad f: For what?\nprofessor c: Uh, uh, uh, I haven't told you what it is yet.\ngrad f: If it works.\nprofessor c: This was my build - up.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. Mmm.\nprofessor c: An i an idea that would be nice i\ngrad f: Yeah. OK, we 're crossing our fingers.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad b: So we 're building a mental space, good.\nprofessor c: If it worked. Yeah.\ngrad f: OK.\nprofessor c: Right, it was a space builder. Um, we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces because, uh, you have somewhat the same things going on of, uh, things being accessible or not.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And so, i\ngrad f: Yep.\nprofessor c: it c it it, uh I think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure.\ngrad f: Use the same  Yep.\nprofessor c: So that pulling something out of a discourse context is I think similar to other kinds of, uh, mental space phenomena.\ngrad b: I see.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm. And And \nprofessor c: Uh, I 've I 've I 've never seen anybody write that up but maybe they did. I don't know. That may be all over the literature.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad e: There's things like ther you know, there's all kinds of stuff like, um, in I think I mentioned last time in Czech if you have a a verb of saying then\ngrad f: So so by default \ngrad e: um, you know, you say something like or or I was thinking you can say something like, \" oh, I thought, uh, you are a republican \" or something like that. Where as in English you would say, \" I thought you were \".\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Um, you know, sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there, so you have to say something about, you know, tense is determined relative to current blah - blah - blah.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Same things happens with pronouns.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: There's languages where, um, if you have a verb of saying then, ehhh, where OK, so a situation like \" Bob said he was going to the movies \", where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking, you 're actually required to have \" I \" there.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Um, and it's sort of in an extended function \nprofessor c: So we would have it be in quotes in English.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad b: Right.\ngrad e: But it's not perceived as a quotative construction.\ngrad f: Right.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: I mean, it's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun, um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing, right?\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad f: Oh, right. Yeah, that makes sense.\ngrad e: Um, but uh, that happens to sound like the word for \" I \" but is actually semantically unrelated to it.\ngrad f: Oh, no!\nprofessor c: Oh, good, I love the formali\ngrad e: Um,\ngrad f: Really?\ngrad e: Yeah. Yeah.\ngrad f: You 're kidding.\ngrad e: There's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption. Uh, Mary Dalrymple, uh, this book, a ninety - three book on, uh on pronoun stuff.\ngrad f: No, that's horrible. OK. That's horrible. OK.\ngrad e: Well, yeah. And then the same thing for ASL where, you know, you 're signing and someone says something. And then, you know, so \" he say \", and then you sort of do a role shift. And then you sign \" I, this, that, and the other \".\ngrad f: Uh - huh.\ngrad e: And you know, \" I did this \". That's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with \" I \". And the role shift thing is completely left out and so on. So, I mean, the point is that pronoun references, uh, you know, sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on, and so forth.\ngrad f: Uh - huh.\ngrad e: And so, yeah, I mean \ngrad f: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So that that d that does sound like it's co consistent with what we 're saying, yeah.\ngrad e: Right. Yeah.\ngrad f: OK, so it's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are occurring in context. And then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the h you know, depending on the construction or the whatever, um, you you you 're scope is m might extend out to the the base one.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: It would be nice to actually use the same, um, mechanism since there are so many cases where you actually need it 'll be one or the other.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: It's like, oh, actually, it's the same same operation.\nprofessor c: Oh, OK, so this this is worth some thought.\ngrad f: So.\ngrad e: It's like it's like what's happening that, yeah, what what's happening, uh, there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that, right?\ngrad f: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad e: So that's that's how Fauconnier would talk about it. And it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: And so,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: um, things like pronoun reference and tense which we 're thinking of as being these discourse - y things actually are relative to a Bayes space which can change.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm,\ngrad e: And we need all the same machinery.\ngrad f: right.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad f: Robert.\nprofessor c: Well, but, uh, this is very good actually\ngrad e: Schade.\nprofessor c: cuz it it it to the extent that it works, it y\ngrad f: Ties it all into it.\nprofessor c: it it ties together several of of these things.\ngrad f: Yeah. Yep.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm. And I 'm sure gonna read the transcript of this one. So. But the, uh, But it's too bad that we don't have a camera. You know, all the pointing is gonna be lost.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Oh, yeah.\ngrad b: Well every time Nancy giggles it means it means that it's your job.\ngrad f: Yeah, that's why I said \" point to Robert \", when I did it.\ngrad a: Uh. Yeah. Mmm, isn't I mean, I 'm I was sort of dubious why why he even introduces this sort of reality, you know, as your basic mental space and then builds up \ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: d doesn't start with some because it's so obvi it should be so obvious, at least it is to me, that whenever I say something I could preface that with \" I think. \" Nuh?\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad a: So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: No, but there's there's a Gricean thing going on there, that when you say \" I think \" you 're actually hedging.\ngrad e: Yeah, I mean \ngrad f: Mmm. It's like I don't totally think \nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Yeah. Y\ngrad f: I mostly think, uh \ngrad a: Yeah, it's Absolutely.\ngrad e: Yeah, it's an it's an evidential. It's sort of semi - grammaticalized. People have talked about it this way. And you know, you can do sort of special things. You can, th put just the phrase \" I think \" as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on, and so forth.\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad e: So \ngrad f: Actually one of the child language researchers who works with T Tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions and it was like it's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways just to mark, you know, uncertainty or something like that.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: So.\ngrad a: Yeah, but about linguistic hedges, I mean, those those tend to be, um, funky anyways because they blur \nprofessor c: So we don't have that in here either do we?\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: Hedges?\nprofessor c: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad f: Hhh, I there used to be a slot for speaker, um, it was something like factivity. I couldn't really remember what it meant\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: so I took it out.\ngrad e: Um.\ngrad f: But it's something \ngrad e: Well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that, right?\ngrad f: we we were talking about sarcasm too, right? Oh, oh.\ngrad e: I mean,\ngrad f: Oh, yeah, yeah, right.\ngrad e: that's what I think is, um, sort of telling you what percent reality you should give this\nprofessor c: So we probably should.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: or the, you know \nprofessor c: Confidence or something like that.\ngrad e: Yeah, and the fact that I 'm, you know the fact maybe if I think it versus he thinks that might, you know, depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever,\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad a: Uh great word in the English language is called \" about \".\ngrad e: you know \ngrad a: If you study how people use that it's also \ngrad f: What's the word?\ngrad a: \" about. \" It's about \nprofessor c: About.\ngrad a: clever.\nprofessor c: Oh, that in that use of \" about \", yeah.\ngrad f: Oh, oh, oh, as a hedge.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: And I think And I think y if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get George started on that.\ngrad e: He wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one.\ngrad b: I r I read that paper,\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad b: the hedges paper? I read some of that paper actually.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad e: Would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti - lock brakes?\ngrad f: What?\nprofessor c: No.\ngrad e: Ask me about it later I 'll tell you how. When we 're not on tape.\ngrad f: I 'd love to know.\ngrad b: Oh, man.\ngrad f: So, and and I think, uh, someone had raised like sarcasm as a complication at some point.\nprofessor c: There's all that stuff. Yeah, let's I I don't I think \ngrad f: And we just won't deal with sarcastic people.\nprofessor c: Yeah, I mean \ngrad e: I don't really know what like We we don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude, right? Like there's not so many different hhh, I don't know, m\ngrad f: Certainly not as some Well, they 're intonational markers I think for the most part.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad f: I don't know too much about the like grammatical \ngrad e: I just mean There's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify, and so on, and so forth.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad e: But like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes?\nprofessor c: Right. Right, so, uh, this this raises the question of what are our current purposes.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Right?\ngrad e: Oh, shoot.\ngrad f: Oh, yeah, do we have any?\ngrad e: Here it is three - fifteen already.\ngrad a: Mmm. Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh, so, um, I I don't know the answer but but, um, it does seem that, you know, this is this is coming along. I think it's it's converging. It's as far as I can tell there's this one major thing we have to do which is the mental the whole s mental space thing. And then there's some other minor things.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Um, and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity. I mean, if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know, w we 'll go nuts.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: So we had started with the idea that the actual, uh, constraint was related to this tourist domain and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain, assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to d you know, there's all sorts of God knows, irony, and stuff like which you isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Yeah?\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: Uh.\ngrad f: M mockery.\nprofessor c: Right. Whatever. So y uh, no end of things th that that, you know, we don't deal with.\ngrad a: But it \nprofessor c: And \ngrad a: i isn't that part easy though\nprofessor c: Go ahead.\ngrad a: because in terms of the s simspec, it would just mean you put one more set of brack brackets around it, and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: N no.\ngrad f: Mmm.\ngrad a: or \nprofessor c: No.\ngrad e: Right.\ngrad f: Maybe.\nprofessor c: No.\ngrad f: Yeah, in model theory cuz the semantics is always like \" speaker believes not - P \", you know?\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: Like \" the speaker says P and believes not - P \".\ngrad e: We have a theoretical model of sarcasm now.\ngrad f: But \nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Yeah, right, I mean.\nprofessor c: No, no.\ngrad f: Right, right, but,\nprofessor c: Anyway, so so, um, I guess uh, let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that, which is that, um, it was Keith's, uh, sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions. Uh, and my suggestion to Keith is that you, over the next couple weeks, n\ngrad e: Mmm.\nprofessor c: don't try to do them in detail or formally but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: Uh, and then when Robert gets back we 'll look at the set of them.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: Just just sort of, you know, define your space.\ngrad e: Yeah, OK.\nprofessor c: And, um, so th these are this is a set of things that I think we ought to deal with.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: And then we 'll we 'll we 'll go back over it and w people will will give feedback on it.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: And then then we 'll have a at least initial spec of of what we 're actually trying to do.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: And that 'll also be useful for anybody who's trying to write a parser.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Knowing uh \ngrad e: In case there's any around.\ngrad f: If we knew anybody like that.\nprofessor c: Right, \" who might want \" et cetera. So, uh \ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: So a and we get this this, uh, portals fixed and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range. And then of course Nancy you 're gonna have to, uh, do your set of but you have to do that anyway.\ngrad f: For the same, yeah, data. Yeah, mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: So so we 're gonna get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains, the tourist domain and the and the child language learning.\ngrad b: Mmm.\nprofessor c: And we 'll see what we need for those two. And then my proposal would be to, um, not totally cut off more general discussion but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we 've we really want to get done.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: And then as a kind of separate thread, think about the more general things and and all that.\ngrad e: Mm - hmm. Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: Well, I also think the detailed discussion will hit you know, bring us to problems that are of a general nature and maybe even \nprofessor c: Uh, without doubt. Yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad a: even suggest some solutions.\nprofessor c: But what I want to do is is is to to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for.\ngrad a: Yeah. Mmm.\nprofessor c: So that that we say these are the things we 're really gonna try do by the end of the summer\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: and other things we 'll put on a list of of research problems or something, because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done because every time you start to do something you say, \" oh, yeah, but what about this case? \"\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: This is this is called being a linguist.\ngrad a: Mmm.\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: And, uh,\ngrad e: Basically.\ngrad f: Or me.\nprofessor c: Huh?\ngrad f: Or me. Anyways \ngrad b: There's that quote in Jurafsky and Martin where where it goes where some guy goes, \" every time I fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up. \"\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad e: Exactly.\nprofessor c: Right. But anyway. So, is is that does that make sense as a, uh a general way to proceed?\ngrad f: Sure, yeah.\ngrad e: Yeah, yeah, we 'll start with that, just figuring out what needs to be done then actually the next step is to start trying to do it.\nprofessor c: Exactly right.\ngrad a: Mmm.\ngrad e: Got it.\ngrad a: Mmm.\ngrad e: OK.\ngrad a: We have a little bit of news, uh, just minor stuff. The one big \ngrad b: Ooo, can I ask a \ngrad e: You ran out of power.\ngrad a: Huh?\ngrad b: Can I ask a quick question about this side?\ngrad a: Yeah.\ngrad f: Yes.\ngrad b: Is this, uh was it intentional to leave off things like \" inherits \" and \ngrad f: Oops. Um,\ngrad e: No.\ngrad f: not really just on the constructions, right?\ngrad b: Yeah, like constructions can inherit from other things,\ngrad f: Um,\ngrad b: am I right?\ngrad f: yeah.\ngrad b: Yeah.\ngrad f: I didn't want to think too much about that for for now.\ngrad b: OK.\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: So, uh, maybe it was subconsciously intentional.\nprofessor c: Yeah, uh yeah.\ngrad e: Um, yeah, there should be I I wanted to s find out someday if there was gonna be some way of dealing with, uh, if this is the right term, multiple inheritance,\nprofessor c: Mm - hmm.\ngrad e: where one construction is inheriting from, uh from both parents,\ngrad f: Uh - huh. Yep.\ngrad e: uh, or different ones, or three or four different ones.\nprofessor c: Yeah. So let me \ngrad e: Cuz the problem is that then you have to \ngrad f: Yeah.\ngrad e: which of you know, which are how they 're getting bound together.\ngrad f: Refer to them.\nprofessor c: Yeah, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\ngrad f: Yeah, and and there are certainly cases like that. Even with just semantic schemas we have some examples.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad f: So, and we 've been talking a little bit about that anyway.\nprofessor c: Yeah. So what I would like to do is separate that problem out.\ngrad f: Inherits.\nprofessor c: So um,\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: my argument is there's nothing you can do with that that you can't do by just having more constructions.\ngrad e: Yeah, yes.\nprofessor c: It's uglier and it d doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff.\ngrad e: That's right.\nprofessor c: Uh,\ngrad e: But whatever.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad e: Yeah, no, no, no no.\ngrad f: Uh, those are over rated.\ngrad e: No, by all means,\nprofessor c: And so I what I 'd like to do is is in the short run focus on getting it right.\ngrad e: right. Uh, sure.\nprofessor c: And when we think we have it right then saying, \" aha!,\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: can we make it more elegant? \"\ngrad e: Yeah, that's \nprofessor c: Can can we, uh What are the generalizations, and stuff?\ngrad e: Yeah. Connect the dots. Yeah.\nprofessor c: But rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we 're doing.\ngrad e: Yep. Yeah.\nprofessor c: So I would say in the short run we 're not gonna b\ngrad e: Yeah.\nprofessor c: First of all, we 're not doing them yet at all. And and it could be that half way through we say, \" aha!, we we now see how we want to clean it up. \"\ngrad e: Mm - hmm.\nprofessor c: Uh, and inheritance is only one I mean, that's one way to organize it but there are others. And it may or may not be the best way.\ngrad e: Yeah.\ngrad a: Mmm.\nprofessor c: I 'm sorry, you had news.\ngrad a: Oh, just small stuff. Um, thanks to Eva on our web site we can now, if you want to run JavaBayes, uh, you could see get download these classes. And then it will enable you she modified the GUI so it has now a m a m a button menu item for saving it into the embedded JavaBayes format.\ngrad d: Mm - hmm.\ngrad b: Mmm.\ngrad a: So that's wonderful.\nprofessor c: Great.\ngrad a: And, um and she, a You tested it out. Do you want to say something about that, that it works, right? With the \ngrad d: I was just checking like, when we wanna, um, get the posterior probability of, like, variables. You know how you asked whether we can, like, just observe all the variables like in the same list? You can't.\ngrad a: Uh - huh.\ngrad d: You have to make separate queries every time.\ngrad a: OK, that's that's a bit unfortunate\ngrad d: So Yeah.\ngrad a: but for the time being it's it's it's fine to do it \ngrad d: You just have to have a long list of, you know, all the variables.\ngrad a: Yeah. But uh \ngrad d: Basically.\ngrad f: Uh, all the things you want to query, you just have to like ask for separately.\ngrad d: Yeah, yeah.\ngrad a: Well that's probably maybe in the long term that's good news because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how how we want to get an out output. Um, but that's a different discussion for a different time. And, um, I don't know. We 're really running late, so I had, uh, an idea yesterday but, uh, I don't know whether we should even start discussing.\nprofessor c: W what Yeah, sure, tell us what it is.\ngrad a: Um, the construal bit that, um, has been pointed to but hasn't been, um, made precise by any means, um, may w may work as follows. I thought that we would, uh that the following thing would be in incredibly nice and I have no clue whether it will work at all or nothing. So that's just a tangent, a couple of mental disclaimers here. Um, imagine you you write a Bayes - net, um \ngrad f: Bayes?\ngrad a: Bayes - net,\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad a: um, completely from scratch every time you do construal. So you have nothing. Just a white piece of paper.\nprofessor c: Mmm, right.\ngrad a: You consult consult your ontology which will tell you a bunch of stuff, and parts, and properties, uh - uh - uh\ngrad f: Grout out the things that that you need.\nprofessor c: Right.\ngrad a: then y you 'd simply write, uh, these into onto your your white piece of paper. And you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there. You won't get you won't really get any C P T's, therefore we need everything that that configures to what the situation is, IE, the context dependent stuff. So you get whatever comes from discourse but also filtered. Uh, so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model.\ngrad f: Mm - hmm.\ngrad a: And that fills in your CPT's with which you can then query, um, the the net that you just wrote and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance U. And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that, that once you we have, you know, precise format in which to write it, so we write it down. You query it. You get the result, and you throw it away. And the the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it. You may have some general rules as to how things can be can be construed as what, so that will allow you to craft the the the initial notes. But it's in that respect it's completely scalable. Because it doesn't have any prior, um, configuration. It's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent modules. And if this can be made to work at all, that 'd be kind of funky.\nprofessor c: Um, it sounds to me like you want P R\ngrad a: P R Ms - uh, PRM I mean, since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net \nprofessor c: Beca - because it b because No, no, you can't. See the the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form. So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can then you can unfold it.\ngrad a: Then you can. Mm - hmm, yeah. No, I was m using it generic. So, uh, probabilistic, whatever, relational models. Whatever you write it. In \nprofessor c: Well, no, but it matters a lot because you what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate, th that you then instantiate in each case.\ngrad a: And then then instantiate them. That's ma maybe the the way the only way it works.\nprofessor c: Yeah, and that's \ngrad a: \nprofessor c: Yeah, that's the only way it could work. I we have a our local expert on P R uh, but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that. But we 'll we 'll have to see.\ngrad a: But, uh,\nprofessor c: Uh Yes. This is that's that would be a good thing to try. It's related to the Hobbs abduction story in that you th you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the, uh \ngrad a: Except there's no no theorem prover involved.\ngrad f: Best explanation.\nprofessor c: No, there isn't a theorem prover but there but but the, um, The cove the the P R Ms are like rules of inference and you 're you 're coupling a bunch of them together.\ngrad a: Mm - hmm, yeah.\nprofessor c: And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to, you know, compute the most likely. Uh Tricky. But you yeah, it's a good it's a it's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal.\ngrad a: What's it?\nprofessor c: So are you gonna write something for us before you go?\ngrad a: Yes. Um.\nprofessor c: Oh, you have something.\ngrad a: In the process thereof, or whatever.\nprofessor c: OK. So, what's what when are we gonna meet again?\ngrad f: When are you leaving?\ngrad a: Fri - uh,\ngrad f: Thursday, Friday?\ngrad a: Thursday's my last day here.\ngrad d: Fri\nprofessor c: Yeah.\ngrad f: OK.\ngrad a: So I would suggest as soon as possible. Do you mean by we, the whole ben gang?\nprofessor c: N no, I didn't mean y just the two of us. We obviously we can we can do this. But the question is do you want to, for example, send the little group, uh, a draft of your thesis proposal and get, uh, another session on feedback on that? Or \ngrad a: We can do it Th - Thursday again. Yeah.\ngrad e: Fine with me. Should we do the one PM time for Thursday since we were on that before or?\ngrad a: Sure.\ngrad e: OK.\nprofessor c: Alright.\ngrad d: Hmm.\ngrad a: Thursday at one? I can also maybe then sort of run through the, uh the talk I have to give at EML which highlights all of our work.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad a: And we can make some last minute changes on that.\nprofessor c: OK.\ngrad b: You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper.\nprofessor c: That - that 'll tell him exactly what's going on. Yeah, that Alright.\ngrad f: Can we do can we do one - thirty?\ngrad a: No.\ngrad f: Oh, you already told me no.\ngrad a: But we can do four.\ngrad f: One, OK, it's fine. I can do one. It's fine. It's fine.\ngrad a: One or four. I don't care.\ngrad e: To me this is equal. I don't care.\ngrad a: If it's equal for all? What should we do?\ngrad f: Yeah, it's fine.\ngrad a: Four?\ngrad f: Fine.

A bit.\nindustrial designer: Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control. Uh well you can see uh \nmarketing: Maybe you can select it.

Meanwhile, this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works. You have uh basically uh the energy, the power of the of the remote control, uh and the sender, w which is the LED, the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the, no, to the set.\nmarketing: Yeah. Alright.\nindustrial designer: And uh the source is of course the user. Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip, and the chip uh sends it to the LED, and the LED sends it to the receiver. That's the that's the basic idea.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Very basic.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key. It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed. The key a signal to a chip, uh the chip senses the connection. uh and recognise the key. So well you understand.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The chip uh produces Morse code, um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed, of course. And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED, which is the bulb, of course.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the, well it's uh very simple, and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal, and performs the assigned task.\nproject manager: So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that. And a button for T_V_. So \nindustrial designer: Ah bu Yeah, but we don't. Uh we {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No no, but Yeah. Exactly. Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I've some couple of pictures here. It's a very basic one. And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it, it uh won't look anything like this, but This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control. It has uh very little buttons and \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah, you can easily recognise the buttons. They're uh far enough apart and an anything. It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh\nuser interface: High tech. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: indeed, and it's not very user-friendly. Uh if you look at the shape, it's uh just a simple long box uh shape. So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that, uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly, and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur.\nmarketing: Right. Can I say something?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons. Uh the power button is used very much, channel selection, volume and teletext. Well teletext is not an option, so that uh \nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But I think it's very important to make um the power, channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb, so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately \nmarketing: Right. Make them big, make them easy to uh to press.\nproject manager: Well but but {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You can also like \nindustrial designer: You don't have to look and and search for them.\nproject manager: if you have um the most used buttons all in one place, and you keep making the same um well moves.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Yeah, I was thinking you can {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, right. Right.\nproject manager: But if y if you would put it at a different place, then you have to move your hands,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and that's on of the things about R_S_I_.\nuser interface: Are some of the the the um \nmarketing: Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right.\nindustrial designer: Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb, of course.\nmarketing: We\nproject manager: No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_.\nmarketing: But Yeah. That's very important. And \nuser interface: Maybe you can make, for for channel changing, two little buttons on the side of the remote, so you can just do like this. Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some\nproject manager: Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons.\nmarketing: But is that is that useable?\nuser interface: Hmm?\nmarketing: Do people, uh when they pick up a remote, know that they have to do that?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well \nmarketing: It's a f it's a new feature,\nproject manager: Well it it's \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it.\nuser interface: Yeah alright, but \nproject manager: Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote \nuser interface: Yeah, but if you s say them up and down, they they'll understand it , I think.\nproject manager: Yeah. If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote, and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel.\nuser interface: Eighty per cent would.\nindustrial designer: Well, .\nmarketing: Yeah, he feels it immediately.\nproject manager: That's very irritating, I think.\nuser interface: Yeah that's true.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's right. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah but {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right, continue.\nindustrial designer: But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed, and as you say at the thumb.\nmarketing: Sorry. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think that's a good idea, and uh and that the less important uh buttons, like the the the different channels, uh the numbers one two three four five as well, should be uh yeah well not in reach, because uh they don't use it uh all the time. Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: And I have some pictures of the inside workings, but uh I don't want to get too technical,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you.\nproject manager: That's your part of the job. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, that's right.\nindustrial designer: So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: And uh well that's about it I think. Oh yeah, I still have this. Oh I had to delete this, but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new \nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: But I had too too little time,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but uh don't uh don't look at it please.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well we understand.\nindustrial designer: I I think it's it's clear uh how it works.\nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: We understand.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's clear.\nproject manager: Oh right, no.\nindustrial designer: Alright. That's the most important thing.\nproject manager: Nice. Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation.\nindustrial designer: Alright. Uh \nproject manager: How late is did we start his presentation uh? \nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: I dunno. I think uh w About twenty minutes ago?\nproject manager: Wha Yeah.\nmarketing: Losing time losing time. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well then we have still the time, so But we do have to come to a decision, right later on.\nmarketing: Yeah right. So \nproject manager: So \nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing, but obviously that's not the case.\nmarketing: I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages, with different links.\nproject manager: Oh yeah?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nproject manager: Uh?\nuser interface: For instance you couldn't see this. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, yeah well.\nuser interface: Um Yeah. Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: The the method? Well I used my own experience with remotes, took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website, which are these two.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: These are already in use?\nuser interface: Yes, these are from from another uh manufacturer.\nmarketing: Alright, okay.\nuser interface: Um This one is engineering-centred, so this one has the most functions and um things.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: Well \nproject manager: I like user-centred.\nmarketing: Yeah, me too.\nuser interface: I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best.\nproject manager: Yeah. We also do that.\nuser interface: Um Well, I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also, and teletext and that kind of stuff.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one.\nmarketing: But we have to reject that, because of the requirements?\nuser interface: But Yes.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Um I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need.\nmarketing: Yeah, right.\nuser interface: I um I kinda like the shape. I think this is what we talked about. But \nindustrial designer: You can't really see uh the differ from different sides.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I think uh \nuser interface: No I've Well I showed it somewhere. Um \nindustrial designer: Uh you can draw it if you Yeah.\nuser interface: Oh yeah. I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So we can can uh yeah customise the \nproject manager: Well absolutely, but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company. So we cannot just uh make someone w\nuser interface: Mm? Yeah. It's a front. It's not the the whole remote that changes, of course.\nproject manager: No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front.\nuser interface: You can \nmarketing: But it \nproject manager: So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it, then uh our recognition is totally gone.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's right\nuser interface: Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's a must.\nuser interface: So l like Ericsson does every uh \nproject manager: Yeah, we must.\nindustrial designer: We can put it on the on the back side.\nmarketing: We must have that.\nproject manager: Yeah well and and \nuser interface: S something like this. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: It's recognisable.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: We can make a symbol of the company right here. And if you put a front on it, there's a hole on the front. So the symbol's always on\nuser interface: Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so that you don't replace the symbol, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah yeah yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah. Something like that,\nproject manager: Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front.\nuser interface: in the Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Those kind of things.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But let's not focus on the front . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. Okay.\nuser interface: Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function. If we we had to include more functions. But we don't. So um \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah. I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need.\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Maybe some less. Like eject we don't need, and some other buttons we don't need. I think uh \nindustrial designer: Mike, uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file? In Map?\nuser interface: Yeah, I will. I think uh for the remote um uh less is more. The less buttons the better the design. Um \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: We should go with that concept I think.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nuser interface: I know.\nproject manager: Alright.\nmarketing: I've I've got another point.\nproject manager: Yeah?\nmarketing: Um there are two target audi audiences, and we've uh chose for the younger one.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Um, research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features. They are high high interested in feature. But they are more critical. Fo Yeah, critical.\nindustrial designer: The younger uh \nmarketing: So The younger audience.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people.\nproject manager: Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top, and the bottom side of the front has a little clip,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh \nmarketing: Clip aren't used much.\nproject manager: Well but because you say they their features are important, they want m um a lot,\nindustrial designer: No um mm usually \nmarketing: Yeah right.\nindustrial designer: But \nproject manager: but not \nuser interface: Yeah, but what kind of features? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think m most \nmarketing: Yeah but Yeah.\nuser interface: But I've \nindustrial designer: Most uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Here, look at these numbers. The newest features are, like I said, are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control. Our audience, these people, are very like these uh features.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Uh.\nmarketing: You see? So we must build in something, or they will to uh go to the concurrent.\nproject manager: Competitors. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Our competitor. Yeah.\nmarketing: The concurrent? Competitors, right.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So, I do think we have to uh have some features.\nproject manager: Yeah. Well maybe w we could uh s\nmarketing: Even though they cost a little more.\nproject manager: On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something,\nmarketing: Right. Right.\nproject manager: or that you can click uh out uh of the remote. And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information.\nmarketing: Like a ticker-tape.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Which programme you are l watching or something.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's nice. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Those kind of things, uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s. And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also, you they can display which programme you're currently watching.\nmarketing: Yeah, right. Yeah right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: For example. It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it.\nuser interface: Yeah, we should keep that simple too.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It will {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But should it uh really be uh clickable, uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well maybe.\nmarketing: No not clickable.\nuser interface: No, it should be uh integrated.\nindustrial designer: or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nah, no no no.\nuser interface: I think {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, just at at the top. So when you s you sit like this you can can watch.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nmarketing: I think it should be at the top.\nuser interface: something like on um some radios in car. You Where it's, yeah, walking to Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah right. It's a ticker-tape idea.\nproject manager: R_D_S_s or something.\nindustrial designer: But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design, with the scrolling text and that kind of thing.\nuser interface: Wa Yeah.\nproject manager: Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling,\nmarketing: Well it's just one script. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh \nmarketing: Yeah, five minutes of ja ja for programming.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So I don't think that's the issue.\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Alright, we go with the L_C_D_ screen?\nproject manager: Uh well I think so, yes. Um \nuser interface: Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost.\nmarketing: 'Kay. Right, I don't know if I can find that, but \nproject manager: We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that.\nuser interface: Or maybe you will get that information uh \nproject manager: Um we can use this board again, I think.\nmarketing: Next time. Yeah right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want, th the issue. Where is my presentation? Uh \nmarketing: Yeah, I understand what you're saying.\nproject manager: Uh \nmarketing: We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look.\nproject manager: Well I mean we're all here now, I think. These I've already given you. So we have to decide on the different remote control functions. So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special.\nmarketing: Right. At the top.\nindustrial designer: Shouldn't we start with the most important parts?\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: At the top or at the bottom?\nindustrial designer: The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button?\nmarketing: I think the top is more uh \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh \nuser interface: Yeah but \nmarketing: When you s How do you zap?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You just sit in your chair?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Huh?\nuser interface: Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural.\nmarketing: With the remote?\nproject manager: That thing is terrible.\nuser interface: 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be.\nproject manager: Uh \nuser interface: Yeah, no Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, I dunno.\nindustrial designer: And then uh \nmarketing: We'll draw two, and then we'll see uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here. I dunno what uh you were talking about but \nmarketing: No {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: we are busy with something .\nmarketing: Um he thinks Yeah, right. He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom, and I think it's better at the top.\nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: Uh-huh. Why do you think it's better at the bottom?\nuser interface: Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom, and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody.\nmarketing: But your \nuser interface: I c\nindustrial designer: But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down, so that there's room for the for the interface.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Well I d I think that's that's ugly but \nmarketing: The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small. It's it's wide.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: It's not not high. But \nproject manager: Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point,\nuser interface: I th\nindustrial designer: And and we can {vocalsound}\nproject manager: because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom.\nuser interface: Yeah. Power button always Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Bottom.\nproject manager: So and and I I like to use the ones on the top.\nuser interface: Yeah, y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah.\nproject manager: So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window \nmarketing: Yeah right. But We're making a remote with with a few functions you know.\nindustrial designer: Well that's a bit exaggerated. Well, I agree with you . It's it's also more recognisable.\nmarketing: We\nindustrial designer: It looks more like a calculator to people, if you have the l the the the thing on top. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes but we we we we don't want that.\nuser interface: Yeah you don't want \nproject manager: We don't want them to look like a calculator.\nuser interface: You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote.\nproject manager: We want to look it like our original but familiar \nindustrial designer: Yeah w well,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away,\nmarketing: High-tech . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yea\nindustrial designer: uh because I think it's uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think it's still important to have it at the top,\nmarketing: Width.\nproject manager: Width. Uh format yeah format? Line width? Width?\nindustrial designer: because it's uh it's more familiar that way.\nmarketing: Th that's not a problem.\nproject manager: Yeah?\nmarketing: When I draw here it\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh. Huh?\nproject manager: It's a bit off.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's off.\nproject manager: Well. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: A little a little bit.\nmarketing: It it needs to be calibrated again. Well \nproject manager: Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe you should another pen.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe that's uh better. You e you only have one pen for that screen. Yeah.\nmarketing: Where?\nproject manager: It's special pen.\nmarketing: Alright, we have to make a decision now,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: because we don't have much time. Um \nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: I think we have uh a few functions, and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it, and still have lots of room at the bottom, where you can put your hand.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I I agree.\nproject manager: I think it should be at the button, bottom. Bottom. The L_C_D_.\nuser interface: At the bottom?\nindustrial designer: Well I'm the I I'm the designer, so um {vocalsound}\nuser interface: In a few minutes \nmarketing: At the bot\nuser interface: Oh yeah, oh yeah, I totally agree. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So We are two uh V_S_ two. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions,\nuser interface: He's the boss. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and then look at the design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right. Great.\nindustrial designer: Uh we uh we were busy with that.\nproject manager: Because we have to decide this.\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So, we have the power button.\nmarketing: And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: It's uh your it's your job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well we have a power button.\nindustrial designer: Yeah of course. Uh it's uh. Yeah. W wh\nuser interface: No it's our job.\nproject manager: Guys?\nuser interface: For all of us I think. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: While you have to agree, I can say it's like this and you must agree. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, right.\nproject manager: Guys?\nmarketing: Alright, let's keep it central.\nproject manager: We have a power button, setting buttons, L_C_D_ window, the number buttons \nuser interface: The ten numbers? Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Channel, yeah.\nproject manager: Uh \nuser interface: Volume?\nindustrial designer: Volume control.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Um \nproject manager: Uh the mute button.", "en_query": "Summarize the presentation and discussion about the technical design.", "zh_query": "总结与会成员对技术设计的介绍和讨论。", "fr_query": "Résumez la présentation et la discussion sur la conception technique.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте презентацію та обговорення технічного проекту.", "en_summary": "Industrial designer introduced the working design including the energy, LED sender, different user interface, and the chipboard with buttons on it.

{"fname": "product_dev_26", "dialogue": "project manager: Right so, good to know all that stuff, thanks guys, um. Now we kind of have to come to some decisions, um, I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it. Um. Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think, I dunno, what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point?\nmarketing: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places.\nproject manager: 'Kay. 'Kay.\nmarketing: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be, that would be a really main cost source then\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: right?\nindustrial designer: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote,\nproject manager: To produce each one.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Per?\nindustrial designer: yeah that's just an estimate though.\nmarketing: Piece.\nuser interface: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I know\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: You industrial designers. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I know.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: It's fun. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty?\nproject manager: Well.\nmarketing: Do we remember?\nindustrial designer: I thought there was some flexibility with that.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: There is, it's just, it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money.\nmarketing: Can we justify it?\nproject manager: Um, from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five. If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: So \nuser interface: Where do you guys come up with these numbers?\nindustrial designer: That's just off the top of my head,\nproject manager: From the board,\nindustrial designer: it is pending further emails. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: um, well \nmarketing: Though I think that's what people would pay for,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote, you're gonna expect it to do something \nproject manager: That's true, I mean \nindustrial designer: It is the new it would be in a class of its own.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know, mass sales anyway, we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things, we just couldn't, not for twenty-five Euros,\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five, sell 'em for thirty, but that's something that we can have finance deal with. Um, I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron?\nuser interface: I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production, my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh \nmarketing: See if we can cut some corners.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option, and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: It's true.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on \nmarketing: Right. It's a starting point anyway, so.\nproject manager: No we could have a s very simple touch screen, you know, there's always the opportunity, if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever, you know, w we yeah, I guess we can play around with it a bit. Alright, let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So \nuser interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points, I think that our casing and the voice recognition \nmarketing: Yeah 'cause with voice recognition I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote.\nproject manager: The voice rec thing,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean, if if we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec.\nmarketing: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: To be honest, we have the capa we have the design in-house,\nmarketing: Price-wise.\nuser interface: I mean we've we've come up with this, with this new voice \nmarketing: True.\nuser interface: we're using it for our coffee machines already.\nmarketing: We've already got it.\nuser interface: I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall. Sounds good.\nproject manager: Hmm. What do you think on it Nathan? About the voice rec?\nindustrial designer: I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically. It would be very nice.\nmarketing: Pretty much.\nuser interface: I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say.\nmarketing: Right and they said they wanted voice recognition. Course, maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option, but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Does having both really up our costs?\nproject manager: I can't see how it wouldn't, I mean, there's you know the old aphorism, you can have it fast, you can have it cheap or you can have it quality, pick two of three. You know, you can't you can't have all three.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function.\nproject manager: It's just impossible.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two. Um. Otherwise, yeah, we just it just becomes cost prohibitive. What which, which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to?\nmarketing: Well, we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent. But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model.\nindustrial designer: I would have to side with that,\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: I think the voice recognition is simpler, we already have the all the technology in-house, it's ready to go, it's packaged, it's \nproject manager: What does the cost look like Ron? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen?\nuser interface: Well my p is \nproject manager: Nathan?\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Um, this is just off the top of my head keep in mind, but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up, but um, since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: we're not gonna have to do as much design work\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up, if you know what I mean.\nproject manager: Right.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, I definitely have to agree with that last comment.\nmarketing: And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: we can stick with what we've already got. In a lot other ways too.\nproject manager: Okay. So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em, the voice recognition will be better. Okay.\nmarketing: I think it's our lower risk option\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option.\nproject manager: Okay. Sorted.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition.\nuser interface: It's you and me outside a little here. {vocalsound}", "en_query": "What did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget?", "zh_query": "在预算有限的情况下，开发团队认为应该使用什么样的触摸屏？", "fr_query": "Qu'a dit le groupe sur l'écran tactile sous la limitation du budget ?", "ukr_query": "Що в групі говорили про сенсорний екран в умовах обмеженого бюджету?", "en_summary": "The group found that if they would use the touch screen as well as the voice recognition technique, the cost would up to 17 euros.

{"fname": "product_dev_43", "dialogue": "project manager: Uh fourth meeting. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We have to do what?\nproject manager: Some extra deciding.\nindustrial designer: W what? Alri alright. We'll see.\nproject manager: Well \nuser interface: Oh.\nproject manager: I'll show you the notes again. Very interesting.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Then um I guess that's your bit? I I didn't s see anything about it,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So the you're uh .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's important too. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And then we'll evaluate, after after we have redesigned it.\nuser interface: Bit late. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Because uh well we'll see about the costs. Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: Well the finance uh we'll do later, so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes. I don't think it's very interesting. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think it is.\nproject manager: Oh nei. Uh no. Alright. This is copy paste. So \nindustrial designer: From me of course, yeah.\nproject manager: Of course. You had some very strange layout.\nindustrial designer: Well from us all, yeah, from all of us. Yeah. It's a nice chorus, yeah.\nproject manager: Well um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We ge we went through the agenda,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and well we had some uh some presentations from you three. And uh I summarised what you said to us. So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again.\nindustrial designer: Repeat it yeah. Alright.\nproject manager: So uh This is what we decided. It's also copy paste from what we made together. So we still know that.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: And then uh we can we can uh use the time better. Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us.\nindustrial designer: Alright, we both uh will?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Or one of us will?\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: Uh \nuser interface: No you go and I'll uh supplement you.\nindustrial designer: Alright. If I make mistakes uh you'll uh \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Correct. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right. Uh well this is our design.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting. With uh the different uh perspectives of it. Uh we'll begin uh with the front. We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape. Um with uh the upper part being the front. Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic, the front. And uh we're we're using different colours. Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: But basically, different colours, bright colours not black, too dark. Fancy colours. Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device. Uh which is of course um part of the back actually, because it's also titanium. You can see it also on the on the on the side view, that only this part is the front, and the rest of it, the under uh the under side uh of it, yeah, the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium, and has the titanium colour of course, the look. Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back, part of the titanium uh titanium part.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's a double R_, but \nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nuser interface: It's a double R_.\nindustrial designer: It's a double R_. Yeah the logo \nuser interface: But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, alright.\nindustrial designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small, but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner. Then we have the buttons. Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons.\nuser interface: Oval yeah.\nproject manager: Alright.\nindustrial designer: So uh oval, n those are here. And then we have the m The m\nuser interface: Channel up and volume?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the the con the the the, yeah, the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here. Um um with kind of arrow shapes, which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons. And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on. We have the Okay button. Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators, of the channel and uh volume um changers.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the \nproject manager: Alright.\nuser interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: And the video button. The \nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Mm right.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Uh this is what we made of it. You can make uh suggestions uh if you want.\nproject manager: Well if I look at it, the side the side view \nuser interface: Well, at the back {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and then you can add suggestions.\nproject manager: Oh yeah alright. Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick.\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front?\nuser interface: No the back. With the logo and our uh l uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah the back. Yeah. We thought about Yeah, uh the back is of course totally titanium. And we thought about the logo big in the middle.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Just so again the double R_. We have then the logo on front and on the back.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Maybe that's too much\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way.\nuser interface: No I don't think And the \nindustrial designer: And the company slogan, we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's basically what we were thinking about,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and \nproject manager: W\nuser interface: And about the side view um This the front won't be as thick,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh \nproject manager: Well I see, but \nindustrial designer: Oh and uh before I forget. Yeah the the voice, of course,\nproject manager: Well. Yeah I see it.\nindustrial designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: And you can record it uh using, yeah, the the the back of the f w device.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view, I think w when I have that in my hand, it's terrible.\nuser interface: Well, it won't be visible. Mm?\nproject manager: If if you look if if this this is thick, and this is thin, th th then it that it lies over your hands. But \nindustrial designer: Why? Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand, {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: mean uh the the the the \nproject manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle, so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker, so th then it falls over your hands.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nuser interface: If y If you handle a remote, you you usually don't have your hand straight like this.\nindustrial designer: In the middle in the \nuser interface: You you have it a bit uh Yeah.\nmarketing: It depends on the size. If it's kinda small, this is is great. But if it's it's larger, then you want to grab it.\nproject manager: And how large is it?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's the question.\nindustrial designer: That's the question.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh well Yeah. H What do you suggest I mean we do? This was Mike's prototype,\nproject manager: Well uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it.\nproject manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet, uh?\nindustrial designer: But now you have a totally different .\nuser interface: Well, they lay there all the time.\nindustrial designer: The size? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean \nproject manager: They the the the the the side view,\nindustrial designer: Side? Uh oh the side?\nproject manager: we didn't uh \nindustrial designer: W we we he drew the s the side,\nuser interface: Yeah yeah.\nindustrial designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well any case, we'll discuss it now. Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea .\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree with the L_C_D_ screen. You have it in your palm like this, and you can watch uh watch the screen. And if you have it li in the middle, your hand might be over it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But you you hold it like this.\nuser interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it,\nindustrial designer: You're not holding it like this or something.\nuser interface: you you {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You, yeah, y How do you call it? Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this.\nproject manager: No no no.\nindustrial designer: You have it more like this.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You you you're using buttons this way, or if you're right-handed, this way.\nmarketing: Like you're holding your telephone.\nproject manager: Yep.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So you Yeah. So \nmarketing: Because if you have a screen on it, you wanna look at your screen.\nuser interface: Hmm. That way, it it falls into your hand. I think. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah well \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher,\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree on this.\nindustrial designer: so Well \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No, I don't think so. That's not uh the point \nuser interface: No but but \nindustrial designer: Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side, but \nuser interface: Well f for as far as I can see, three of us agree\nproject manager: Yeah well\nuser interface: and only Nils \nproject manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it.\nuser interface: But you're the Project Manager, you can make the hard decisions. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. So uh I c I c\nindustrial designer: If necessary.\nproject manager: Well, we'll we we'll do it like this.\nindustrial designer: But uh are d Can you live with it? Uh \nproject manager: Alright, if you think that that's the way it should \nuser interface: Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Y Yeah, y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable.\nproject manager: No No,\nindustrial designer: But do you\nproject manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market uh \nindustrial designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess. I think.\nproject manager: No not totally.\nindustrial designer: Not totally, well \nproject manager: For me, I I wouldn't buy it. Let's say it like that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human. We have to take uh every everyone into account. So \nproject manager: No \nmarketing: And you might be uh You might be target customer.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yes but \nindustrial designer: Well uh who who else thinks like you?\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: We don't know.\nproject manager: Yeah, we don't know,\nindustrial designer: Maybe a thousand people,\nproject manager: but that's uh that's that's that's more market research.\nindustrial designer: or a million people.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So let it be like this at uh at this moment.\nindustrial designer: Let it be.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay?\nindustrial designer: Alright. So that's that.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh any other suggestions?\nproject manager: No, I think it's great.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: But what about the redesigning?\nproject manager: Comes to that later.\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um you. Uh c You can uh Walter. You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You're very personal again.\nmarketing: Alright. Great.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's more useful than just speaking.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, this is just a short intro.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation. That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly. Well, I put some questions in a Word file. See if I can find them. Uh uh uh uh mm.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Well \nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation, so uh I don't have to explain it. Uh the first question is, uh is the device good-looking? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly. Seventy five percent of them. So what do we think?\nindustrial designer: Well d we designed it, so of course we are very \nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah, we're we're not quite uh objective about this.\nmarketing: Yeah \nuser interface: Well we designed it to be good-looking.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: No, I know, but I have to uh evaluate it. So I have to take this questionnaire.\nproject manager: To the customers?\nindustrial designer: So and we ha we have answer now?\nproject manager: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. \nmarketing: Yeah Yeah, but I can't can s\nproject manager: Nei. Oh no. I know, I know, I know.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: But um Well we can go, uh because of the time, uh pretty quick through this. Uh do we find it good-looking? Well we think so. Uh \nuser interface: Yeah. We designed it to be good-looking, so \nindustrial designer: I Yeah, I think it \nmarketing: Yeah, but uh, you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So But we have to be critic critical about it. And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end. So we we know where we stand.\nproject manager: Well, one.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten.\nproject manager: Well so it's point four. Easy to find t\nindustrial designer: Well l well let's start with the beginning, just one by one. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right, so Right. Uh is it good-looking?\nindustrial designer: Well, I guess uh I think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course, uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything. \nproject manager: Two. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: That was our target audience of course. But it's also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people I guess. Uh it's it's not f a device that \nmarketing: The titanium might be uh f for older people.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's that's uh for older people, it's it's more that classical look. So \nmarketing: It you put uh put a black front on it or something.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh no. I think Yeah they like black of course, but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think it's also good for them, so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people. So I think it's very good-looking\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: and not only for youth uh young people.\nuser interface: I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long, because I don't know how how many points there are but uh \nproject manager: No. I totally agree.\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, the fourteen yeah.\nproject manager: We we have to get get on, go through this.\nmarketing: Right, a number please.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Is it easy to t change channels? Yeah well I think so.\nmarketing: So the last one is seven.\nuser interface: Um, no it's uh \nmarketing: Easy to change channels?\nproject manager: No, not false. It's one.\nmarketing: Oh, sorry.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, right.\nproject manager: Well uh two? Y Well we have to go through it .\nmarketing: Change channels?\nindustrial designer: I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made. Uh \nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: So I Yeah. You How can you make it any easier? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: With two huge buttons.\nmarketing: The power, channel and volume buttons are easy accessible?\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, huge is a Yeah.\nproject manager: Two.\nmarketing: Two? Alright. The uh device is easy to find if you lose it?\nproject manager: Well, no. We didn't implement anything about that. \nindustrial designer: D we d we don't we don't have uh that s\nuser interface: Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something,\nproject manager: Well six then. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: because of the colour. But {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Six? Right.\nindustrial designer: Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so,\nproject manager: Are the functions easy to learn?\nindustrial designer: but um um \nproject manager: Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an \nuser interface: We have so few functions, so Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nproject manager: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive?\nuser interface: Well, I should I think two,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: because the voice recorder is n not self learning. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: Alright. Two?\nindustrial designer: Mm?\nproject manager: Yeah, but just do some We we \nmarketing: Yeah \nproject manager: I th I th I think this is too time consuming.\nindustrial designer: Are we take too much time?\nproject manager: Uh not not towards you,\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nproject manager: but towards this all.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Th this is \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: We you have to put it to the customers.\nmarketing: Right, R_ R_S_I_ sensitive? R_S_I_ sensitive?\nproject manager: Uh well well a bit, so four.\nmarketing: Four. Um \nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, very much. One.\nproject manager: One. And features included also one. And One.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking. Uh we still think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Device fancy feeling.\nindustrial designer: And I think fancy-feeling too,\nproject manager: Yeah, cool man.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: because of the titanium back. Yeah.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Are there enough technology? Yeah well also we have two.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's great.\nproject manager: Is the device easy to use?\nuser interface: The \nproject manager: Yes we have not many buttons.\nindustrial designer: So well maybe two\nproject manager: Two, three.\nuser interface: Two two.\nindustrial designer: because of the voice recorder.\nmarketing: Well, with the uh Three.\nproject manager: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented?\nuser interface: T\nindustrial designer: F\nproject manager: Well in our covers, in our fronts.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So yes, one.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. One or two. Yeah.\nuser interface: One or two, another two.\nmarketing: Nah f four I think.\nindustrial designer: Four?\nmarketing: If you look at this {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, it doesn't really resemble any fruit, uh that's true.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Oh okay. Okay .\nuser interface: Well three.\nmarketing: Three, alright.\nindustrial designer: And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, that's true.\nproject manager: Is the material attractive?\nmarketing: But {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm. Yeah.\nproject manager: Well the titanium is strong, and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft. So I would say at least two.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well Yeah.\nuser interface: This is the last meeting?\nproject manager: Yes, but we we have to design much more,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: The average will uh come later.\nproject manager: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me. Um \nindustrial designer: I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly.\nproject manager: Oh. Uh \nindustrial designer: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. Well, look at the costs at this point.\nindustrial designer: My god.\nproject manager: I had to fit it in.\nmarketing: It has to go to twelve, right?\nproject manager: I twelve and a half.\nmarketing: Twelve and a half.\nproject manager: So Well what costs a lot? The sample spea costs four.\nindustrial designer: The what?\nproject manager: The sample speaker,\nindustrial designer: The \nmarketing: Out.\nproject manager: the s sensor.\nmarketing: That's easy. Kick it out.\nproject manager: Kick it out.\nuser interface: The what?\nproject manager: We have to go to twelve and a half.\nmarketing: Yeah. The speaker.\nproject manager: The speaker costs far, by far the most.\nuser interface: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option.\nmarketing: That's some wrong info, man. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It it isn't worth it.\nindustrial designer: No. No, d th No.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: We could make two different versions, one with and one without.\nmarketing: It's uh \nproject manager: But for this {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's just extra. Kick it out.\nproject manager: So, zero.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Then we go to fourteen point six.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually.\nmarketing: What more?\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: Batteries are uh quite \nproject manager: L_C_ three? Yeah hand dynamo? Y t come on,\nmarketing: Uh no, no no no.\nproject manager: w a remote control has a battery.\nuser interface: Um \nindustrial designer: N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think.\nuser interface: Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip?\nindustrial designer: Because uh \nproject manager: Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said.\nindustrial designer: the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah?\nmarketing: Hmm.\nuser interface: Can't we do that with a regular chip?\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: Why not?\nindustrial designer: Because uh that uh y {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular?\nindustrial designer: because my information says it.\nproject manager: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip?\nindustrial designer: Huh?\nuser interface: Yeah. Regular is normal.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And simple?\nindustrial designer: Uh well yeah I I read something about it, but \nuser interface: Simple.\nproject manager: Nothing.\nuser interface: Elementary.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well?\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: Your part.\nindustrial designer: I I read something about it, but it wasn't very clear. I d I didn't in include it in my report.\nproject manager: What happens if we do \nindustrial designer: Single Well you have to use a chip. So Well you have to use the advanced chip, if you have the L_C_D_ screen.\nproject manager: How much do we win? One.\nuser interface: We we we Why?\nproject manager: \nuser interface: We have very little options furthermore, for the \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But if you have a regular chip, you can't have the L_C_D_ screen.\nuser interface: Uh well we have to put that in.\nmarketing: Yeah, we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: That that's a fact. Uh \nproject manager: Well, we could say, well this special colour, that isn't that that isn't there,\nmarketing: No {vocalsound}\nproject manager: because the the fronts they will buy it. The special colour.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but it's only one half.\nmarketing: Yeah, but \nuser interface: Nah.\nindustrial designer: Uh it d it doesn't \nmarketing: No, that's n It's not relevant.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah, you must change the chip uh back.\nproject manager: then you s then you only have one half left.\nuser interface: You must change the chip back, Nils.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh yeah.\nindustrial designer: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen.\nmarketing: No, Then the whole concept is uh\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I know but that's what my information says. I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm. No we oh \nmarketing: You You can make you can make it cheaper.\nindustrial designer: You have to use it.\nmarketing: But if you don't sell\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and we have an L_C_ display. I think that's a bit double.\nproject manager: Yeah? No, {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Y we don't need both.\nproject manager: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display.\nindustrial designer: For the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Says .\nproject manager: Says, his Uh that was in the second meeting, I think.\nindustrial designer: Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again? Because we you have uncurved \nproject manager: Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved,\nuser interface: I?\nproject manager: uh he,\nuser interface:?\nproject manager: because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: We can also make it flat.\nindustrial designer: Well \nmarketing: No\nindustrial designer: But what what did what do n\nmarketing: no no no.\nproject manager: But \nindustrial designer: Sorry, but What do they mean with the curves?\nproject manager: Curved?\nindustrial designer: Is th Is this a curve?\nproject manager: Yes, that's curved.\nindustrial designer: One curve?\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, this is actually two curves, yeah.\nproject manager: No, it's one curve.\nindustrial designer: It's how you It's how you look at it.\nuser interface: One curve. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: One curve, simple.\nindustrial designer: Well then we have a huge problem I think.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half.\nproject manager: We have a big financial problem.\nuser interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy.\nproject manager: Well, then we have two dollars less profit. Come on, if we if we if we make this fifty million, they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us, so uh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: If if you make people brand-aware, they are willing to pay more. But Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back. If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy.\nindustrial designer: But uh I \nuser interface: Yeah or we could replace it \nmarketing: If you if you make it cool to have \nproject manager: By the way, we also have this one.\nmarketing: Oh, that's just great.\nproject manager: Oh, costs nothing. That's nice. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh, alright. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen, it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing.\nproject manager: Plastic is Yes, but I just got it.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: Well that's pretty uh l\nuser interface: Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium,\nmarketing: That is pretty stupid. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: N not very practical. Well \nuser interface: uh titanium-coloured plastic?\nproject manager: Who?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You want to dump the titanium?\nuser interface: Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper.\nproject manager: And make all plastic, then we ha then we're there.\nindustrial designer: But I'm n I don't agree.\nuser interface: But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again.\nindustrial designer: I think \nproject manager: Th then you have a ugly, stupid, l ugly looking, dumb remote that that no-one would buy.\nuser interface: Ah no no.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's not ugly looking. The looks remain the same.\nproject manager: No, I don't think so.\nuser interface: Well, I do think so.\nindustrial designer: I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the \nmarketing: Y\nproject manager: Yes. And the feel,\nuser interface: feel.\nproject manager: and th that it is strong, and \nindustrial designer: And also the the older people will like it because of that. And because i\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nindustrial designer: Alright it's not our target audience, but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people.\nproject manager: We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: but not lose the one \nindustrial designer: I think the titanium is very important.\nuser interface: Yeah alright but then we we won't get there.\nindustrial designer: Yeah we have a problem, yeah. W But you can better, yeah, dump the L_C_D_ screen then.\nuser interface: We can dump the special colour. We l we use plastic. And plastic is already in colour I think.\nmarketing: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: Well what else?\nuser interface: No, nothing.\nindustrial designer: W I mean uh \nmarketing: Or you shou It's \nuser interface: Amen.\nmarketing: Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen. But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Because you have lots of functions in it too.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, well yeah. Alright.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Why can't I \nuser interface: But \nindustrial designer: I agree with that. So we u we use uh Unfortunately. Um. Titanium-coloured plastic.\nproject manager: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nindustrial designer: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back.\nproject manager: I I'll talk to the managers. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No no no no. W Titanium stays there.\nproject manager: Titanium, I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote. But {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah this is good,\nmarketing: Osl {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but it it's not good enough. So we have to use the ditch the titanium, I'm afraid.\nproject manager: Ah those those account managers, what do th d what do they know?\nuser interface: Well \nproject manager: Come on. Riot. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: What do we Well what do we know? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs. So \nproject manager: Yes, yes.\nuser interface: No because we did not know anything about it.\nproject manager: One and a half Euros. Hmm?\nindustrial designer: Yeah al alright, yeah.\nmarketing: If you don't have the money, you can't make it.\nindustrial designer: But we have to deal with it now. So \nmarketing: So s If you don't have the money, you can't make it. So this is too expensive.\nproject manager: So?\nindustrial designer: So \nmarketing: So we have to make it cheaper.\nindustrial designer: Titanium gone and add plastic.\nuser interface: Yeah, but then we've got money left.\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: And on plastic times two and then we uh are there?\nproject manager: Well, no it's just uh all plastic.\nindustrial designer: No \nproject manager: Well alright. Huh.\nindustrial designer: No yeah well \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh six. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's just free, man.\nindustrial designer: A lot of plastic, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Four. So \nindustrial designer: No two for the to make it clear.\nproject manager: But then we can add the special colour? As we have money over uh left. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: And we still have money left.\nuser interface: Yeah. W\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What do we want, guys?\nindustrial designer: I want gold plating.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No no um {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah right. I want chrome. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well I think uh the case is double curved then.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Because you y have that curve\nindustrial designer: We have we have to uh fill \nuser interface: and you have that curve.\nproject manager: Y Oh no. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, th that that is the problem.\nuser interface: Yeah well uh \nindustrial designer: W we ha {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Alright.\nindustrial designer: No no no, but th that's not f um \nproject manager: Safe.\nuser interface: Well y we have curves in all directions.\nindustrial designer: Well you can you can double curve, if you don't have titanium. And that we dropped,\nproject manager: So alright.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so it it can be done. But it's pretty funny. We we do want to reach twelve point five. But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven.\nproject manager: Finance?\nuser interface: I mean, this this ain't titanium, but it looks like it.\nproject manager: Well, guys?\nindustrial designer: We get more salary, if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Guys?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We have to dump our titanium,\nmarketing: Shoot.\nproject manager: and we'll hate the managers for that, but now we're going to evaluate our project, of uh project,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Objection.\nuser interface: Pro project. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: project. Well, satisfaction on for example, are we satisfactory about our creativity?\nindustrial designer: Well I can't get no satisfaction, but uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think it's uh Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best, yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, me too.\nproject manager: That's really bad. But that that that's that, yeah that's a reason,\nindustrial designer: Its it's uh ridiculous actually, but \nuser interface: And uh unrealistic.\nproject manager: but also for our creativity. We had um nice design, and then you get the cost, and you had to dump all your creativity.\nuser interface: Well we we we used our creativity,\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: but we just had to adapt it to the costs.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Which isn't very practical,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Nei. Uh no. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but that's the way.\nproject manager: Well, alright.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh leadership next.\nuser interface: Terrible. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh teamwork? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Leadership.\nuser interface: Leadership? Well \nmarketing: Well it's It was very democratic. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh yeah well I think so also.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time, so \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah yeah.\nproject manager: Well the managers were terrible. So, with their all their useless requirements.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But o alright, the teamwork?\nindustrial designer: Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's the requirements of the user, uh I guess.\nproject manager: No they said, oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext, uh we won't use the D_V_D_. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Alright, teamwork? Well great I think.\nmarketing: Well \nuser interface: Right yeah. \nmarketing: Yeah, think so too.\nproject manager: Uh well what do you, what did you think about the SMARTboard?\nindustrial designer: It was a complete disaster.\nmarketing: Yeah, I don't like it. Yeah?\nindustrial designer: No Uh it it it uh it is uh \nproject manager: Well \nuser interface: No, that's a SMARTboard, and that's a digital pen.\nproject manager: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards.\nuser interface: Or not?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No it's other way around. That's the SMARTboard.\nproject manager: I liked this SMARTboard,\nindustrial designer: That's the digital panel.\nproject manager: but I hated that one.\nmarketing: This this this isn't a SMARTboard, right?\nproject manager: Well it's both a SMARTboard.\nindustrial designer: That's that's the smart\nmarketing: Yeah right. B but you \nuser interface: Oh they're both SMARTboards. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: This is just a large t large television.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: A televi Yeah.\nmarketing: You u you use the {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's both a SMARTboard, but this one is used for a desktop, and that one is used to to draw.\nmarketing: Yeah, but you ca This is just a beamer function. And here, on this one, you can uh draw the pictures and things like that. But \nproject manager: Well, wi w which one did you like?\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Left or right? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That one.\nproject manager: That one. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: That one isn't accurate. It just doesn't work.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But I I think this is meant by the digital pen.\nmarketing: You can \nproject manager: Yes. Th that is so.\nindustrial designer: Well I didn't use uh \nmarketing: Yeah, but I think there's a big distinction between the these th\nproject manager: We're now talking about the SMARTboards.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't need a SMARTboard.\nuser interface: Well we we used that one,\nindustrial designer: Nei It it's much m {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and we needed it. I think.\nmarketing: Yeah, but give me a beamer. That's uh that's much uh much cheaper.\nuser interface: Yeah alright, but \nproject manager: Or install a laptop to a beamer, or have this one standing here in an I I like it.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Okay, alright.\nuser interface: Yeah I like that one, but that one is terrible.\nindustrial designer: But uh you can uh I I sent it about three times now. Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah, it is.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The simple uh sch school board.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: I agree.\nproject manager: And uh the digi the digital pen? Did uh did you like that one?\nindustrial designer: I I didn't use it.\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop.\nproject manager: I used it uh just to check it out, but uh \nindustrial designer: That's the \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: You you can't send that to anyone, because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself,\nuser interface: \nmarketing: Yeah. It isn't practical. Right.\nproject manager: and then you're going to send it, yeah. Well, no.\nindustrial designer: W But also y you write things down. And i you can also bring your your your note block.\nmarketing: Your notepad. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into \nproject manager: It's, no, it it's useless.\nuser interface: Well I I drew this. Mm. And I made a mistake. But it it would have been uh useful, if I I could show this on the screen.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah alright. For drawings,\nproject manager: For drawings, yes.\nuser interface: Yeah for drawings.\nindustrial designer: but not for personal notes. I think that's not very \nuser interface: N notes mm.\nindustrial designer: Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper \nproject manager: But \nmarketing: Yeah, it might be useful for drawings. I I agree on that.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: If you've If you've {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But for notes, it i you you have to put that in a strict Uh you have to put a name, standard date, and all those things. And notes uh for a meeting are very strict. So if you uh were to write them down for yourself, and then put that in your computer, you still have to type it over to Word.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it doesn't d doesn't have any {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, right.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah I understand.\nmarketing: That Stefan use.\nindustrial designer: But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork. You can't It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are Yeah.\nmarketing: No, I don't think so. It's it's only useful if you have to draw something.\nuser interface: Yeah. But then uh it's really useful, I think.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep. Alright. Um etcetera? Well uh the laptops?\nindustrial designer: Mu Yeah right.\nproject manager: Of course great.\nmarketing: Yeah, great. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Can we keep them? Uh.\nproject manager: Yeah. You can.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: B by my {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Wireless uh wireless things.\nuser interface: Thanks Project Manager. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Other uh things we used here? I hated the cameras, I hated the microphones. But No {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well these chairs, man. Really great.\nindustrial designer: Well did you really uh Did you really take uh take those in account? I half of time I didn't notice they were there. So \nproject manager: No. No. I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera. I don't care about it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But we shouldn't talk about that.\nuser interface: Well I did.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Because this is a realistic environment.\nproject manager: Well w why not? Uh etcetera  We \nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: N new ideas found?\nindustrial designer: Right. Okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule What? For future um meetings you have got?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well I missed uh the option to uh to email,\nmarketing: Communicate in between.\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: Chatting and emailing.\nuser interface: Email or chat or something.\nindustrial designer: But yeah. W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with. So \nmarketing: Yeah, right. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah alright, but that's one n new idea. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nproject manager: Well, new ideas found by this.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Not. Nothing.\nmarketing: Well, more more information in the beginning.\nproject manager: We don't want this. We hate this.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's \nproject manager: Digital pen is useless. So \nuser interface: No it isn't.\nproject manager: Yeah, for drawings.\nindustrial designer: Well, for drawing for drawings. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. So it isn't useless.\nproject manager: But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings, because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things, I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive, I'm not going to uh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well No \nmarketing: For people who uh sketch th the whole day, I can imagine that it's useful.\nproject manager: Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But it's still an expensive uh expensive \nproject manager: Because this is huge\nmarketing: Well {vocalsound}\nproject manager: uh this v very very uh expensive paper.\nuser interface: Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nuser interface: With the mouse it is No. \nindustrial designer: But if w Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well and if \nmarketing: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching.\nuser interface: Uh indeed.\nindustrial designer: And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone. But suppose it was working correctly, what uh would it be useful then, if it wasn't off all the time? A\nproject manager: Well no. I hated to draw like that. You you can't draw anything uh neat.\nindustrial designer: Really?\nmarketing: Yeah, but he's saying if it is correct, and you can draw very, yeah, very precise \nindustrial designer: Anything you want. Any b b Yeah. L li li\nproject manager: I if it if it would be perfect following.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board.\nindustrial designer: Well it isn't, but maybe that thing is uh is \nmarketing: Yeah, mu\nindustrial designer: Yeah, board, a school board, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but but then you can uh save it in instantly, and and and re-use it, and uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: I it has It is useful. Yeah.\nmarketing: It saves time.\nproject manager: Yeah yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: This uh if it works correct, maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work,\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: I think then it's pretty useful.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And then you can save it immediately.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, they are now.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: Celebration.\nproject manager: It is. So, congratulations crew.\nindustrial designer: Did you type that?\nuser interface: Hmm. Celebration. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Se {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well \nproject manager: Finally my beer. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, that's it I think.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um I don't know how long we still have. I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting. But uh \nindustrial designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well dunno. Yeah.\nproject manager: Well yeah, it is a bit uh Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things. I have to do that.\nuser interface: \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I Di did you um save this one in the folder?\nmarketing: You better get started. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh.\nproject manager: Can you do that?\nuser interface: No. No no no no.\nindustrial designer: No we must save this thing, yeah. In the shared map map.\nuser interface: But Nils you've got some work left. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I don't know what you have to do.\nindustrial designer: Map, is it a good word? The folder, yeah.\nmarketing: Huh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I have to go to a physiotherapy. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh it worked. Two times quick. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Wow. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh, alright. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Cool. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So it is useful, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. It is handy.\nproject manager: This is nice.\nindustrial designer: No but uh \nmarketing: Oh great, man.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom.\nindustrial designer: Radical. Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: D design.\nindustrial designer: Do you believe it yourself?\nproject manager: S Oh. He saved them all ten. Well alright. Um \nuser interface: Well they they wanted everything we produced, so {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit, and uh \nuser interface: My big bird. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: Your big beautiful bird.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Where is this?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Of or the other way around uh \nmarketing: Maybe you are broken.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think so too.\nuser interface: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You know. I think she's listening. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I also think so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Who is she you're talking about?\nproject manager: She already knows. She? Big brother.\nindustrial designer: Oh you mean our uh coach, our f personal coach.\nproject manager: Our manager.\nindustrial designer: Is she also our accountant?\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is she responsible for sending that information so late? Oh.\nproject manager: I don't think so.\nuser interface: Close your laptop.\nindustrial designer: Because then we have to confront her with our \nuser interface: So she can see we're ready.\nmarketing: I feel watched. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We put the fashion in electronics,\nuser interface: Yeah. Let's take this remote into uh production.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but we couldn't because of the costs. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That that's the title of our uh end document.\nmarketing: Yeah. \nindustrial designer: That that's our new slogan.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I like that. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Blame our accountants.\nmarketing: Do that.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's a nice title. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But we couldn't, yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Very catching. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Well I th Yeah.\nmarketing: I'm sure management would like that. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: She's on the move.\nproject manager: I'm going to resign after this project anyway, so {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh, that's just great.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "The group mainly talked about the extra deciding of the product at this meeting including the presentation of the prototype assessment, the discussion of the requirements and trends of marketing and the product cost and quotation. Firstly, the Industrial Designer introduced the prototype of the product. It had not only the round basic shape which was made of hard plastics and titanium using different colors, but also the buttons like channel and volumn. Later, the group discussed some details and changes of redesigning the logo, buttons and screens. Next, the Marketing Expert mentioned the exterior of the product, the material attraction, and how easy it was to learn or use the basic functions of the product.

{"fname": "product_dev_55", "dialogue": "marketing: So So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market, about um yeah what people think. Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons. And we looked at uh several um things. Uh among them design, uh d d how d did they like the use of it, uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls. Uh well what what will be our market. And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features. If um that would be a good idea or not. Well our findings. Uh our users, they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls. Um uh they especially found found them very ugly. And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it. Uh well they also zap a lot. So uh zapping uh should be very easy. And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons. So a lot of unused buttons. There is more findings. Uh on the buttons. Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not? And how much would they use them? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection. And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are. The power, volume and channel selections are very relevant. Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important. Uh not important they found the audio, uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch, or the left or right. Uh the screen and the brightness. And uh channel settings. Uh th and they also are not used very often. Then we have a few um graphs about the market. Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups. Um as you can see, most users are uh between thirty six and forty five. Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big. And to come back on the the swapping uh things, uh I don't think uh, I I think the younger will be most interest in it. But uh they are not a very big group. Um in the we asked them, uh how would you like a s a new feature. If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control, what would you think of it. Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice. And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And they won't like it. And another thing, how would you like to have a speech recognition on it. Well here we see the same. Young users uh think that's an interesting idea. And old users not. Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim. Uh the first are the younger, the age between sixteen and forty five. Uh they are highly interested in the features, as you can see uh here. And um they are more critical on their money spending. Uh the second group is the older group. Aged between forty six and sixty five. They are less interested in uh new features. But uh they spend their money more easily. Now if we look back at this graph, we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent. And the second group about forty percent. So the the first group is bigger. Well then I come to my uh personal preferences. Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at. Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it. But less of them will buy it. Um well I uh Okay. What I thought, um even young people say it's hard to use, remote control. So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use, that's especially aimed at this group, even uh the young group will also be more interested. And um we can make special features. But uh I think it looks nice in the first time. But when use it, uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um well th uh that's my second point.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control. It's about discussion we had earlier. Um You can find most functions on a T_V_ set. So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options, or screen options to change the brightness. And such things. Um well the design is very important. One thing I did not say I think, is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one.

{"fname": "product_dev_111", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Yep. So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy, and the material and interface. For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities. First one, we can use simple battery, or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic, rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nmarketing: Ah.\nindustrial designer: and then uh titanium, which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display. And we can use some , moving kind of thing. So, as we discussed before, we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control. So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors. And we also want to look at our remote control, so. Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range, like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that. So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm, okay.\nindustrial designer: So uh we discussed an Excuse me. So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery. And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes.\nmarketing: What is a double-curved shape?\nindustrial designer: Like you can have two curves.\nmarketing: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: Why?\nindustrial designer: Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic.

You m titanium it's more uh \nindustrial designer: and Yeah.\nuser interface: W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm like this?\nproject manager: Yes so mm \nuser interface: to make it feel better and to you know \nindustrial designer: Like in cell phones recently\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: these you can with the rubber in four directions and \nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay. \nindustrial designer: yeah.

So the batteries uh are going to be very light.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: for really light batteries and with uh good price.\nmarketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically, instead of clapping why not just be ask.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five, six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent. If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology\nproject manager: Okay,\nindustrial designer: and so \nproject manager: for the location. Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something.\nmarketing: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.

Uh, so Let's uh,\nmarketing: It's my turn.\nproject manager: yeah, let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.

So, evaluation please. So. You made a very nice prototype, and um, I think, we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it, if it fulfils our what we want to do, and things like that. So mm Uh, next slide, please. As you know, before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control, it's very important to first verify if it makes sense, if we have a chance to sell it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh, so we need to evaluate it um, try to do it in a constative way, and as much as we can. To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven. One meaning that, ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion, whatever it is. And seven meaning, no it doesn't fulfil at all. And we're all l going to list all the criterion. I'm going to go to that next slide,\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven. And then we are just going to have an average, which will give us the value of our uh remote control. So, maybe we can have a look at the criteria?\nindustrial designer: Fancy.\nmarketing: So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important. Of course, this can be discussed, but let's let's see, so let's vote. So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Huh.\nmarketing: So,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, what's is really \nmarketing: what do you think, is it fancy? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh, it's really {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh, I think that fancy, we can say it is fancy. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It is very very fancy. Or have you ever seen something like that? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh. I am not the d the only one choosing, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, of course.\nproject manager: Uh what do you think?\nmarketing: What do you think?\nuser interface: Feel the weight.\nmarketing: Is it The weight is later.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Oh.\nuser interface: Really. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-huh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Now we're {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: We're on the fanciness now. I think it's quite fancy.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We can give at least five or six, seven.\nmarketing: It's uh Yeah, so No it's it's one.\nproject manager: It's in the other .\nindustrial designer: Oh, Oh. So Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Oh, okay. So \nmarketing: Yeah, o one means it's, yes, a very fancy and seven mean no at all.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So it's one or two.\nproject manager: Two.

We have uh we have speech recognition, we have location based ,\nindustrial designer: And we have L_C_D_.\nmarketing: we have L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Change colour of t\nindustrial designer: So you change colours.\nmarketing: Change colour, I mean that's very \nindustrial designer: Useful.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think it's a \nmarketing: Quite\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: d I think it's a one for that, at least.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. It's silly.\nmarketing: At least a one, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Robustness, uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Uh, still we need to cha {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away.\nproject manager: Um \nmarketing: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again? Uh, maybe not the prototype.\nproject manager: The strawberries {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Let's try. Oh my god. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe strawberry.\nmarketing: Okay, we just lost one strawberry.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: So {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No. How can I say this.\nmarketing: Not at all?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we can easily plug it.\nuser interface: It's still it's still working, and your daughter got a bonus.\nmarketing: It is Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: A strawberry.\nmarketing: So it's not so bad.\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: I um uh I would say three.\nproject manager: Yeah. But it's too .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's um robust, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, that does make sense, yeah?\nindustrial designer: Useful?\nmarketing: Useful. Well, so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, \nmarketing: So I don't know. These buttons are uh It not clear.\nproject manager: Oh, yeah, lets me try.\nmarketing: But you have at least uh next produce.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: What is uh next, please?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, channel. I this is volume control and channel changes. These are the main \nmarketing: Uh, it depends on the \nproject manager: And you can uh do di two sites?\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: You \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option.\nproject manager: Okay, also.\nindustrial designer: So if you don't want \nmarketing: So but, for instance, because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control, touch screen, you cannot go to channel twenty five directly.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, um yeah.\nproject manager: You can, by using the \nuser interface: You can.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Directly.\nuser interface: You go you \nproject manager: You c push here the the \nuser interface: So, the basic mode \nproject manager: yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. So that's simple. The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: With two buttons, you do this like uh volume up, volume down.\nmarketing: Oh, it's a jog dial, okay.\nuser interface: Or if you go to the site, it's channel up channel down.\nindustrial designer: And channel.\nmarketing: Uh-huh. Okay.\nuser interface: And if you want to make to s twenty-five, you push on this.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: You select twenty, you select five.\nindustrial designer: You can select.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: That's it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah mm.\nmarketing: It's much longer than that that being two two five, no?\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: Don't you think so? May not okay, we can go. That's uh You're right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah.\nmarketing: That's it's less uh Yeah. But it's it's nice, because people anyway don't go there.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. Yeah mm.\nmarketing: But So what do you think for it, usefulness?\nindustrial designer: So, d Yeah, we need to address we want \nmarketing: Seems to be useful. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_. So\nproject manager: Let me understand well,\nindustrial designer: so \nproject manager: because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button.\nmarketing: Both. Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Up.\nmarketing: Up down or left right. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. And which what is that?\nuser interface: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: This is jog wheel.\nmarketing: That \nproject manager: Okay, okay. It's a kind Oh, okay okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Like, selecting the menus.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Um, see in L_C_D_, like you will have blocks and you select which one.\nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Oh oh okay, great.\nmarketing: I would say then uh \nproject manager: Now it's looks us useful.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Two or three?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Two or three?\nindustrial designer: Two, maybe. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Two.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, two. So size and weight.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. \nmarketing: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size, real weight? Or Because it \nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's size al almost \nmarketing: Size is going to be that, yeah?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, because it is \nmarketing: Uh, and and \nindustrial designer: The weight will be bit lighter. We will s We use titanium.\nuser interface: Sure,\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nuser interface: without titanium alloy, it's going to be light.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: It's going to be lighter,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Of course.\nmarketing: because this seems to be very heavy f I mean,\nindustrial designer: Heavy. Yeah.\nmarketing: for my daughter, for instance.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Not sure if uh she can use it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But sides uh, the sides should be okay. . Yeah\nmarketing: So, should be okay.\nindustrial designer: mm.\nmarketing: Up to three for that,\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nmarketing: because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh \nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: Colour and shape.\nproject manager: Uh-oh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, so colour, it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: But um, it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The case is silver titanium, no?\nmarketing: It's a it's going to be titanium. Okay, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That's nice.\nproject manager: Let's imagine.\nmarketing: I think it's good. Okay.\nproject manager: And what about the strawberries on the top? I'm not convince. But maybe I'm not trendy. But, uh \nmarketing: Yahoo. Well y you know, it's this uh fruit and vegetable year.\nindustrial designer: Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but uh uh they're not useful.\nmarketing: So {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I I mean it that's uh \nindustrial designer: So maybe, I think \nmarketing: Uh, I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, well \nmarketing: Whether it's fancy or not now, it we have to decide.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Um \nmarketing: But this\nproject manager: I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful.\nmarketing: If it's Uh-huh. So, that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, well then it's bit difficult to use. Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction, too.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. But the n Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So, maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff for strawberries and different colours.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: So it's \nmarketing: So, it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh \nindustrial designer: Even \nproject manager: No, I'm not sure uh why \nindustrial designer: These buttons \nproject manager: uh if it was like this \nindustrial designer: But it looks really not really good.\nproject manager: I It's n no, it's not fancy any more.\nindustrial designer: I mean, the f Yeah. So these are kind of rubber things. Even if you lose one you can just put whatever.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: And \nindustrial designer: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits, and \nproject manager: Uh-huh. And different routes. Okay, I see what \nuser interface: Moreover, moreover it covers it covers all the end goals. Even if it is, you know, it's very rounded,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: but still you got some rubber fruit here, and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here,\nproject manager: Also.\nindustrial designer: so we just Yeah, so even if you don't put, it works. But this is really fancy. \nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: I suggested three.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Because uh, everybody s doesn't seem to be convince,\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: although it's quite \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: You have good arguments.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: But \nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And uh the last one is adaptive. This is not r maybe not as important as the other one, {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use?\nuser interface: Sure, sure, just look at it. It's full adaptable. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Great.\nproject manager: Wow, that's a {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Fully adaptable.\nuser interface: Yeah, you can fit it into your palm, you know.\nmarketing: That's Yeah. So you can fit into your palm, okay.\nproject manager: Yea\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That \nindustrial designer: You can \nmarketing: What else can we need?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well?\nproject manager: Yeah, it's fudge titanium. You know.\nmarketing: It's fudge, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Right, yeah. And uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm, \nmarketing: Yeah, fruit titanium, yeah. Well, I if if this is if you are ready to do that, then I think it deserves a one. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Let's go for one. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Now we have to do the average. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Three, three, six, eight, eleven.\nmarketing: Who is good in math? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's two point one seven.\nmarketing: Okay. Two point one seven. That's nice. Two point one seven out of seven.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: I think we have a good good thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Well, that's all I had to say about the evaluation.\nproject manager: So it's a good evaluation.\nmarketing: So It seems to be good, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah mm.\nmarketing: We have uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah, two one one seven, we have. So \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nmarketing: Yeah. Okay. Thanks.\nproject manager: Okay. So now, it has to fulfil the financial criterium?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Financi\nmarketing: Ah-ha.\nproject manager: So, I have an Here. Um \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Energy.\nmarketing: So so how many batteries do we need?\nindustrial designer: Uh, we use bat One battery.\nmarketing: One battery?\nproject manager: Okay,\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: so two.\nmarketing: Good. Why two?\nindustrial designer: Oh, we just need one, I guess.\nmarketing: Say no. No, ne never install.\nproject manager: Uh-huh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Two batteries or one?\nproject manager: Oh.\nindustrial designer: No, number is one. We need only one battery.\nproject manager: Yeah yeah,\nmarketing: Only one.\nproject manager: but the price is two. Oh, number.\nmarketing: No, no. But no, no. No, no way.\nproject manager: Sorry sorry sorry. I'm sorry.\nuser interface: No, uh you just \nindustrial designer: Number, number.\nuser interface: Number. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah. Oh.\nmarketing: Yeah. You never use uh Excel? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No, never. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: How \nmarketing: Good. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: What what's the limit? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: H {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's twelve bucks.\nuser interface: Uh, it's it's okay that I don't know, 'cause uh it's not my field. Twelve bucks. Okay,\nmarketing: Twelve bucks.\nuser interface: now Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Twelve and a half, I think.\nuser interface: Check that number also. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So we \nmarketing: Okay. Okay, electronics.\nindustrial designer: We have sample chip.\nmarketing: So \nindustrial designer: Uh, like simple chip, yeah.\nmarketing: It's a simple chip?\nindustrial designer: So, yeah.\nmarketing: Simple chip, okay. One.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Four buttons at least.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And for the One also.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, one to one.\nmarketing: One or two? One?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, one.\nmarketing: Okay. So the case, which one uh is it in the end?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think we will go for a single curve, no?\nmarketing: Let's do a single curve.\nindustrial designer: Oh, is \nuser interface: It's it's flat.\nindustrial designer: Oh. Oh, okay.\nmarketing: It's flat, and curved.\nproject manager: I thought you can curve\nuser interface: It's flat.\nproject manager: somebody. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But it is flat,\nmarketing: It's curvable. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: you Look. It's curvable, but it's not curved. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Maybe there is a supplement for that , no?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: It's only curve?\nproject manager: Oh see, I I think that the the price is this one.\nmarketing: Okay, let's go.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: This Okay,\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: you d {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Don't chip on me.\nmarketing: We tried, we tried.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh, okay.\nindustrial designer: Oh. Titanium.\nmarketing: So, what is it? T titanium?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm, that's expensive.\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah. But she wanted u the fudge titanium.\nmarketing: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, well \nmarketing: Let's stick to s titan.\nproject manager: I think it's five, but you don't say . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Special colour?\nuser interface: Well, n Why three?\nindustrial designer: No, only one, no?\nmarketing: No because uh \nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Why three?\nproject manager: Oh, sorry. Again, I'm  See it.\nindustrial designer: Um \nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Special colour,\nindustrial designer: Interface.\nproject manager: or it's only on the \nmarketing: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Yes, in L_C_D_ display.\nproject manager: Yeah, but there is no colour here.\nindustrial designer: Ok Yeah, an Yeah.\nproject manager: So I put it here.\nindustrial designer: Push-button.\nmarketing: So the L_C_D_ \nproject manager: How many push-button?\nindustrial designer: Scro\nproject manager: Three or two?\nindustrial designer: Uh, two.\nmarketing: Two.\nproject manager: Is there The scroll-wheel, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: One scroll wheel.\nmarketing: It's going to be expensive. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: One L_C_D_ displayed.\nproject manager: Okay. Um That's that's not \nmarketing: That's all?\nproject manager: We choose this one, and not this one.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: No. Oh, I think, no it's \nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's cheaper.\nmarketing: Uh, is it a scroll wheel and pe push button, th this centre one?\nproject manager: Or only a scroll-wheel.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Only scroll wheel.\nmarketing: Or only only scroll wheel, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah mm. So \nproject manager: You try to s {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You are trying to make make up make us up.\nproject manager: No, no, no.\nindustrial designer: It's already \nproject manager: Because how do you do to y select?\nindustrial designer: Ah.\nmarketing: No, but you select with the two d the other two buttons,\nproject manager: Yeah, I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel\nindustrial designer: Y ye\nmarketing: no? That's true.\nproject manager: and then you \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Then it automatically we can just do like you feel, it goes. And it will activate \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Stay longer. Okay.\nmarketing: It should stay. Yeah.\nproject manager: Oops. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um, plus, yeah, it's price is really {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, okay. Um \nindustrial designer: Special colours, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: For buttons.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: No,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, buttons and strawberries.\nuser interface: buttons just normal.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Special form.\nproject manager: You you have all of these, no?\nmarketing: She's very hard on this. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm maybe n not this one but \nmarketing: Special colour? Yeah. No. Special material?\nuser interface: That's for buttons.\nindustrial designer: Uh, we have titan\nuser interface: But buttons are standard.\nmarketing: Yeah, buttons are the standard buttons. Yeah. It's only buttons, these.\nproject manager: Yeah, so \nmarketing: Nothing special.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. So we are at seventeen dot eight.\nproject manager: Not special colours an interest in?\nmarketing: No, the colour is in the L_C_D_.\nproject manager: And buttons are not colourised? They are m\nindustrial designer: Mm, hmm,\nmarketing: I no.\nindustrial designer: I think uh because you can just go for a good colours.\nmarketing: We can just use this red.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and uh \nmarketing: It's {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Boo-hoo. It's already too expensive. Apparently.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now?\nproject manager: Yeah. Mm.\nmarketing: Uh, until we get twelve fifty.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So think of what we can cut uh here. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, if I look at what is the most expensive things, uh it's the L_C_D_\nindustrial designer: Sample speaker.\nmarketing: and the speaker.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Apparently, we have to choose one or the other. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Well, as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng, I mean, producing electricity from mechanical energy. So, the point is that when you take device and push the button, you produce enough energy\nproject manager: But you don't need a battery?\nuser interface: to make electricity. Yeah, that you don't need a battery. So, it's something like hand dynamo robot. A real high-tech version of it.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: But um\nmarketing: So that would \nproject manager: it's like the hand dynamo, no?\nindustrial designer: Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand\nmarketing: So, but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay, we only \nindustrial designer: is \nmarketing: We we win one.\nuser interface: Okay,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That's already that.\nproject manager: Uh it's a it's a beginning.\nmarketing: Okay, let's do that.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Why not.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Let's do that.\nproject manager: So One here and here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just remo\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nuser interface: And I propose to \nindustrial designer: S\nuser interface: So uh, about chips. Advanced chip on print, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So, put minus one there, please. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: I'm not sure if this is legal.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: That's right. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Why not?\nindustrial designer: Uh, no.\nuser interface: And?\nmarketing: And?\nproject manager: M maybe minus uh three, no? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: No. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So, was there result?\nindustrial designer: No, no. It's not \nmarketing: Okay, let's see.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm.\nuser interface: Let's have a look.\nindustrial designer: It's not changing, no?\nuser interface: Why?\nindustrial designer: It you don't\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah, if Click somewhere, you'll see features.\nuser interface: Oops.\nmarketing: Yes, it does.\nproject manager: So {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Maybe put minus two, so it looks uh more reasonable. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Why not.\nmarketing: Yeah, anyway \nproject manager: Oh, sorry.\nuser interface: Minus.\nmarketing: No, minus two.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Nobody will know.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's not recorded, is it?\nuser interface: Good.\nmarketing: Okay, we're on time.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Good.\nindustrial designer: So now on, we can increase our Still you have two more. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh, we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want.\nindustrial designer: Maybe we can use it for our party.\nproject manager: Oh.\nuser interface: And a battery and a battery, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Both its it's cool. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: No, now we are exp exceeding I think.\nuser interface: Now it's fancy,\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: let's add one instead of two. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that \nmarketing: It Is it? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah y\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think we're exceeding now.\nindustrial designer: No, but point five point three.\nmarketing: We have to remove the \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Uh, it's better. I think they are counting uh \nproject manager: Yeah. Mm. It's maximum\nindustrial designer: Is really strict?\nmarketing: We would prefer,\nproject manager: and don't have to Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: yeah. Maximum is maximum.\nproject manager: Uh \nindustrial designer: Oh yeah.\nmarketing: So, remove one of them. Yeah. Okay. Okay, we're uh on target.\nproject manager: Uh, mm-mm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Mm. So target reached. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm just curious to see this\nindustrial designer: Ho {vocalsound}\nmarketing: uh my address chip on print.\nproject manager: It's um English uh Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Trick. Uh, I would say it's the Russian trick, but\nproject manager: Yeah, but uh is uh English. So \nmarketing: Anyway No,\nindustrial designer: Oh. Uh \nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well, I don't know.\nmarketing: they may have some their origins, strange origins \nuser interface: I don't know. I am not sure who was programming this calculator, you know. 'Cause uh I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number.\nproject manager: Mm, let's try.\nmarketing: No, no, no.\nindustrial designer: And we can discuss all these things in our party.\nmarketing: Let's finish this meeting instead. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. I save it uh \nmarketing: What else?\nproject manager: Okay, so next mm {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: No, that's yours.\nmarketing: This is right.\nproject manager: Sorry.\nmarketing: Okay,\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: so finance, that's done. Are the cost under twelve?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah, very much.\nmarketing: Yes. Project evaluation, good. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. So now \nuser interface: Next slide.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Project process.\nproject manager: We have to make um {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Safe uh asse uh safe assessment.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah. Mm. See mm how Are we a good team? Mm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, I think we've listened to everybody.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Everybody could say what they thought.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: And uh \nproject manager: Is there enough room for creativity?\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm. And you. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. When we see the results, there is no doubt there {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's really \nproject manager: Mm. Oh. Okay. Well, project evaluation.\nmarketing: Maybe a lack of leadership? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: M maybe not, huh?\nmarketing: Team-work, very strong, I would say.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, our team-work is really strong.\nmarketing: Team-work, no problem. Means. Whiteboard, digital pens.\nindustrial designer: Oh, we still , I guess.\nuser interface: What was the Oh yeah, what was good? Everything. What was bad?\nmarketing: Yeah, I think white-board is useful. Digital pens, useful.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: New ideas found?\nproject manager: So, you say, is there sheep? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Luck. Okay. So luck, but good. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But uh \nproject manager: Which imply good uh team performance.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager:  {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. A good leader, you know, a good leader is somewhere in the shade and \nmarketing: but uh then I I mus That's true. And there's uh one very important point.\nindustrial designer: Don't really.\nmarketing: We're on time.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. And we also \nmarketing: Meetings finish when they have to or even before.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm. We made Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing.\nuser interface: Of course. Uh \nproject manager: Okay. Mm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Not to waste time, that's important.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah, we have other uh remote controls to create. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: We need time f\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Ah, we got new idea, speech recognition, location finding. New materials, new s uh this fancy strawberry design.\nproject manager: A lot of uh \nuser interface: New materials.\nmarketing: Mm. .\nproject manager: Yeah, uh new ways of doing financial {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm, yeah. Hey,\nindustrial designer: And new tricks. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh\nproject manager: Mm. Mm. They're working on um pink titanium. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: . They are working on a \nindustrial designer: Ah, very .\nmarketing: Okay, good.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Budget.\nmarketing: I think we are great.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: There's no no other words for that. We are probably the best.\nuser interface: Alright.\nproject manager: Mm yeah. Yeah,\nmarketing: Real Reaction is uh\nproject manager: we're really nice.\nmarketing: Yeah.

Yeah.\nuser interface: Well we we can add another button here, but \nproject manager: Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay.

Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works.\nproject manager: Yes, well but bec because when you push Menu you get in,\nindustrial designer: Yeah? Yeah?\nproject manager: and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice.\nuser interface: Ah right. Well you you \nindustrial designer: Yeah.

The s the stu\nproject manager: and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote.\nuser interface: yeah, and the remote control might not yeah,\nindustrial designer: Mm\nuser interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular, right?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: So mm uh are are are \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: we're still yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh \nmarketing: I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot really.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: You know, so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: because actually I mean they're all still re young people.\nmarketing: Is not a massive difference, you know. No, do totally.\nproject manager: Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs?\nindustrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features, but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it? Uh and uh \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though, don't you? Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But how frequently do we use it anyway\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and um uh h ho how good is it,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh \nmarketing: I don't know.\nproject manager: Yeah. With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five,\nuser interface: An\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: S so \nproject manager: louder,\nindustrial designer: Right. Okay.\nproject manager: tha that should be relatively simple.\nindustrial designer: O {vocalsound}\nmarketing: y you'd maybe need a code word. Do you know what I mean?\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: So like when you say change, except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: so maybe like, you know, remote. I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Although I only watch Charmed, so really I wouldn't know\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine.\nindustrial designer: Right. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: Um, so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money,\nuser interface: Yeah but uh um Yeah, yeah sure, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls.\nuser interface: Yeah, w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons\nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: and um, yeah it's it's kind of safer, so we we need both,\nindustrial designer: Mm. W\nproject manager: I think we need both.\nindustrial designer: What uh \nuser interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra, it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say, I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five.\nproject manager: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so if uh if something like that can be incorporated, {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, that would be another way to do it.\nproject manager: So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great.\nindustrial designer: some kind of \nmarketing: Yeah, but then the code word would be even more important, because I mean Sky advertise on every channel, don't they, you know,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed, and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky.\nproject manager: Watch Sky and yeah.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's \nmarketing: and that would be really annoying. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. But that's definitely a possibility.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away, so it might not pick up the other things coming from there.\nmarketing: Yeah. Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though?\nproject manager: So that you can yell at it,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, you know, so you have to have the remote control.\nproject manager: yeah.\nmarketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Alright.\nuser interface: Yeah, but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television, because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control, so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then \nindustrial designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll mm.\nuser interface: No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and uh not to yell at it from the distance.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm. So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control, wherever it is, it'll beep,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so we we can probably come to know where it is.\nproject manager: That's \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: but then if you're buying the remote separately,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: but y you could have something, but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something,\nuser interface: Oh yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack, so one part attaches to the T_V_.\nuser interface: Okay, yeah, mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah, 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control.\nproject manager: The l\nindustrial designer: Alright, yeah.\nproject manager: Well that's right, but it solves the problem of having different noises.\nmarketing: Yeah, definitely, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um. But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the buttons so it's easy to use, but only those key buttons, the major buttons and then one sort of menu one, and then voice recognition included as an option\nuser interface: The major ones, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, which y you'll get immediately by email. Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes, and then we've got a lunch break\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder, but I'll send you an email when I do it, so that you know.\nindustrial designer: So where exactly is this i\nproject manager: It should be on your desktop, so on the \nindustrial designer: Ah, okay.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them.\nuser interface: Did you find it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah in that one,\nuser interface: It's just yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: right yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, and email them round.\nmarketing: Oh, so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there, hey?\nproject manager: Yeah, that would be great.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there,\nproject manager: Oh yeah, put them in there. Yeah,\nuser interface: we we yeah, w we won't even okay.\nmarketing: There you go.\nproject manager: then you don't have to email them.\nmarketing: But is everyone's called functional requirements?\nindustrial designer: No.\nproject manager: No, they're all called something slightly different. Technical requirements and something something, yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, so that's good.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: That's me done.\nproject manager: So, if you put them in there, we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to.\nmarketing: Okay, cool.\nproject manager: Um as to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah? Whatever that means.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I guess I'll find out. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept,\nuser interface: Uh something conceptual, yeah.\nproject manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: um we'll keep keep our options op hmm?\nindustrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into? Con components, oh.\nproject manager: Components,\nuser interface: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Sorry, but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our \nproject manager: No, we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare,\nuser interface: To prepare, okay, yeah, that's good.\nproject manager: so that's fine, w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay?

{"fname": "product_dev_46", "dialogue": "industrial designer: Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting. With uh the different uh perspectives of it. Uh we'll begin uh with the front. We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape. Um with uh the upper part being the front. Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic, the front. And uh we're we're using different colours. Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: But basically, different colours, bright colours not black, too dark. Fancy colours. Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device. Uh which is of course um part of the back actually, because it's also titanium. You can see it also on the on the on the side view, that only this part is the front, and the rest of it, the under uh the under side uh of it, yeah, the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium, and has the titanium colour of course, the look. Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back, part of the titanium uh titanium part.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's a double R_, but \nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nuser interface: It's a double R_.\nindustrial designer: It's a double R_. Yeah the logo \nuser interface: But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, alright.\nindustrial designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small, but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner. Then we have the buttons. Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons.\nuser interface: Oval yeah.\nproject manager: Alright.\nindustrial designer: So uh oval, n those are here. And then we have the m The m\nuser interface: Channel up and volume?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the the con the the the, yeah, the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here. Um um with kind of arrow shapes, which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons. And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on. We have the Okay button. Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators, of the channel and uh volume um changers.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the \nproject manager: Alright.\nuser interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: And the video button. The \nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Mm right.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Uh this is what we made of it.

Yeah the the voice, of course,\nproject manager: Well. Yeah I see it.\nindustrial designer: the voice recorder is uh at the bottom.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: And you can record it uh using, yeah, the the the back of the f w device.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: When I look at uh when I look at this side view, I think w when I have that in my hand, it's terrible.\nuser interface: Well, it won't be visible. Mm?\nproject manager: If if you look if if this this is thick, and this is thin, th th then it that it lies over your hands. But \nindustrial designer: Why? Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand, {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: mean uh the the the the \nproject manager: Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle, so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker, so th then it falls over your hands.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nuser interface: If y If you handle a remote, you you usually don't have your hand straight like this.\nindustrial designer: In the middle in the \nuser interface: You you have it a bit uh Yeah.\nmarketing: It depends on the size. If it's kinda small, this is is great. But if it's it's larger, then you want to grab it.\nproject manager: And how large is it?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's the question.\nindustrial designer: That's the question.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh well Yeah. H What do you suggest I mean we do? This was Mike's prototype,\nproject manager: Well uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and y you seemed to agreed on it.\nproject manager: Well the sides I haven't seen yet, uh?\nindustrial designer: But now you have a totally different .\nuser interface: Well, they lay there all the time.\nindustrial designer: The size? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean \nproject manager: They the the the the the side view,\nindustrial designer: Side? Uh oh the side?\nproject manager: we didn't uh \nindustrial designer: W we we he drew the s the side,\nuser interface: Yeah yeah.\nindustrial designer: but you d you weren't paying attention as usual.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well any case, we'll discuss it now. Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea .\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree with the L_C_D_ screen. You have it in your palm like this, and you can watch uh watch the screen. And if you have it li in the middle, your hand might be over it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But you you hold it like this.\nuser interface: Yeah you you don't you don't grab it,\nindustrial designer: You're not holding it like this or something.\nuser interface: you you {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You, yeah, y How do you call it? Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well y y y you don't have it like this.\nproject manager: No no no.\nindustrial designer: You have it more like this.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You you you're using buttons this way, or if you're right-handed, this way.\nmarketing: Like you're holding your telephone.\nproject manager: Yep.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So you Yeah. So \nmarketing: Because if you have a screen on it, you wanna look at your screen.\nuser interface: Hmm. That way, it it falls into your hand. I think. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah well \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher,\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree on this.\nindustrial designer: so Well \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No, I don't think so. That's not uh the point \nuser interface: No but but \nindustrial designer: Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side, but \nuser interface: Well f for as far as I can see, three of us agree\nproject manager: Yeah well\nuser interface: and only Nils \nproject manager: uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it.\nuser interface: But you're the Project Manager, you can make the hard decisions. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. So uh I c I c\nindustrial designer: If necessary.\nproject manager: Well, we'll we we'll do it like this.\nindustrial designer: But uh are d Can you live with it? Uh \nproject manager: Alright, if you think that that's the way it should \nuser interface: Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Y Yeah, y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable.\nproject manager: No No,\nindustrial designer: But do you\nproject manager: when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market uh \nindustrial designer: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess. I think.\nproject manager: No not totally.\nindustrial designer: Not totally, well \nproject manager: For me, I I wouldn't buy it. Let's say it like that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but of course y you are also human. We have to take uh every everyone into account.

Alright.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Alright. Yeah.\nuser interface: Well Nah.\nindustrial designer: But it Yeah. \nproject manager: Okay. Huh.\nuser interface: Ha, even more. N\nproject manager: Mm no.

The \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I got this from our friends.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So Uh yeah the conceptual design.\nindustrial designer: Our sources.\nproject manager: These are a few examples which we have to decide about. All the the materials from the case, uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story. Um \nmarketing: Your bag. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Um now from the user interface, your uh package? Um where No well, that's more like the buttons where they have to come. And um B a bit of, yeah well, a bit of uh design.\nuser interface: Yeah, this is what we've just done. Right?\nproject manager: Yes, but we have to decide about these now.\nindustrial designer: But uh we should decide now.\nuser interface: Ah right.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And uh the trend-watching.\nmarketing: Materials are the most, most impor\nproject manager: So as you said, fruity is in, well sells good.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Wow.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh these things.\nindustrial designer: So we have to uh put it in one uh document. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh yes. Um so if we uh go through them \nindustrial designer: Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document, and then uh put the answers after the subjects. Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Not everything.\nindustrial designer: Well we have to decide all these things?\nuser interface: Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine.\nproject manager: Yeah well uh Why should I uh \nindustrial designer: W we can uh override them?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Well a case? Uh that's me. Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What what kind of properties should it have? Well we just listened.\nindustrial designer: Uh s solid,\nuser interface: I think we {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard, yeah, some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front.\nmarketing: Do you know the new uh \nuser interface: That Just like um most cell phones are.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I understand.\nmarketing: No no {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. So we have titanium. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The front is the most important.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: to give that uh strong look.\nproject manager: You know what?\nindustrial designer: And then the front is made of plastic. And you can put that on and off, and switch it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But the feel of plastic isn't strong. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No but you have titanium of course.\nuser interface: No but you you have this Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh you have the best of both worlds.\nmarketing: Yeah alright, alright. 'Kay.\nuser interface: Yeah, you have the re remote in your hand like this. So you feel titanium. \nindustrial designer: And of course, yeah, you have the the the plastic front end. But you also have the titanium.\nmarketing: Yeah. Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah of course, but yeah you have to make a decision.\nuser interface: And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to.\nmarketing: Yeah, but it it's expensive.\nindustrial designer: I guess so.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh titanium I sh I think uh \nmarketing: Bendable.\nindustrial designer: Huh? Well, well the \nmarketing: Bendable.\nuser interface: Well any colour \nindustrial designer: According to my sources, uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available, and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it, if we want.\nuser interface: Yeah, then you you paint it in the colour you want it. The plastic is is the colour you want it.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah. Paint spray.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah alright.\nuser interface: So  Yeah.\nproject manager: Alright.\nmarketing: So, we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front?\nproject manager: I've uh \nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: Titanium back, plastic front.\nindustrial designer: I think that's a nice trade-off.\nproject manager: Okay. Um well I am going to put it in here, uh because we can uh look.\nmarketing: Yeah, great.\nproject manager: I Um solid feel and trendy look.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: So material, um hard plastic for the front?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, for the front and then titanium for the back.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: For the non-removable uh part.\nmarketing: But then you have the problem, when you have a titanium back, you can't switch it. When you want an other colour on the front, it doesn't match.\nuser interface: Well titanium is neutral. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well but {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You know?\nindustrial designer: The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah, i it doesn't uh curves.\nmarketing: I understand.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No uh I nei. Titanium is very No no no, but you know b Titanium is very basic colour,\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I dunno if if you disagree,\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Well \nindustrial designer: but I think it's doesn't matter very much.\nuser interface: Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours,\nmarketing: Yeah. Alright.\nuser interface: and they don't use uh wood.\nmarketing: Funky customers.\nindustrial designer: And even if it does uh doesn't match, it will uh People like mm colours that don't match.\nuser interface: Mm. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. And well\nmarketing: Alright. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: the the electrical cable is just normal uh . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Cop copper uh material.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Excuse me?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The electrical cable uh does \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's uh from uh our coffee uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh \nuser interface: No we don't use an electrical cable.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Yeah inside, but this is for the coffee uh machine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah in \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh \nproject manager: Of course.\nuser interface: Yeah, but that's not what's meant here, I think. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nei.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: So external.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh external?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja. Never mind the coffee grind.\nproject manager: Well uh\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work. So {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The chip is normal silicon.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh the buttons are normal, etcetera.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay? So that's just easy.\nindustrial designer: Alright. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes. The conceptual specification of the user interface? Um well we have our beautiful drawing.\nuser interface: Well I got a better one here\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: and I will um \nproject manager: Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder,\nuser interface: The shared folder.\nproject manager: and then I'll put it in our end report.\nuser interface: I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting.\nproject manager: Yes, you can Mm yeah. You can uh put some uh which button is what.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Um\nuser interface: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: the trend-watching  included these days. And what do we?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We thing that fruit and bright colours are \nindustrial designer: Yeah the the the front w\nmarketing: I think we can launch a couple of packages. You can buy a different kind of of of machine,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: but it's the same thing, but with another front.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot.\nmarketing: So \nuser interface: Yeah that's the whole idea of the front.\nmarketing: And you can you can \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: Uh those kind of things.\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: But that's for later on. The fronts y you can do anything with them.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini \nuser interface: Yeah, right For the uh initiative uh launch.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: For the for the launch, yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: It's good marketing.\nproject manager: Launch different lines at once.\nindustrial designer: So e th then a c couple of basic colours. Not not very uh sim Not {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, n not too heavy. You can always take another pick. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time.\nmarketing: They have to buy it later on.\nuser interface: Oh yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Come on. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: More basic.\nproject manager: We still have to make those fifty million, yeah?.\nindustrial designer: Very boring, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so,\nindustrial designer: The most boring fronts possible.\nproject manager: The most ugly.\nuser interface: so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more.\nmarketing: Yeah, right.\nproject manager: Two.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but you you can have some basic colours, and then we come with the special patterns on them,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Red red, blue and green you give them or something,\nindustrial designer: and and uh \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: and then you can give them uh other ones.\nindustrial designer: And uh \nproject manager: Yeah. Alright. Um well the buttons etcetera, we get from Mike. Uh this fruit and bright colours, yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour, we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch, when we uh well introduce our remote.\nindustrial designer: Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design. Because yeah we have the sketch but \nmarketing: Yeah. But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: Else it w won't sell.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Alright, yeah.\nproject manager: Well I'll have to, before I get another warning for five minutes, I'm going to get Where is my mouse? Uh where is my mouse? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Lost my mouse. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um this is it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Unbelievable. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, um this we have.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh basic stuff. Interface we have. Supplements, L_C_D_. Maybe a a cheap voice recording. Well \nuser interface: Yeah we should do that.\nindustrial designer: The price?\nproject manager: Yes. Alright. Individual actions.\nindustrial designer: We all agree on that. Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Industry designer, . User Interface, Mike. You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.\nuser interface: Yeah, we can do that.\nindustrial designer: Together or uh Yeah together.\nmarketing: Yeah togeth {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's what I got uh to hear.\nindustrial designer: How Yeah yeah, but how do I \nuser interface: But bu we stay we stay here or something?\nproject manager: Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But I think so. Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it \nmarketing: You can take the SMARTboard. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: This is the SMARTboard, so \nuser interface: Ah right. And take it to our rooms and uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype, and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera.\nuser interface: Ah, specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.

So first, it's your turn.\nindustrial designer: \nuser interface: Mine. Oh, great.\nproject manager: Yeah. Isn't it amazing. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Huh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. Very interesting.\nuser interface: Uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Industrial Designer. Interface concept.\nuser interface: Yes, well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept. Uh, first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose, uh show you some samples, uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe, already. And uh my personal preferences. Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off. The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off. The channels buttons, one to nine, and uh off uh uh zero to nine, and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine. Uh the volume and channel quadrants, uh left and right, up and down arrows, to uh do the volume and channel. And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display. Um, I found some uh interesting uh uh samples. Examples.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh \nmarketing: Large.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long.\nmarketing: A lot a lot of buttons buttons.\nuser interface: Um, power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right. Um, well we see the the the same uh arrows. Like there. And uh Yeah, well arrow b buttons can be blue. And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons. Some buttons have icons like the play and stop, but we don't use that. But uh, these we we have to choose the right icons, or or letters. Uh this is the V_ for volume, but they're both uh a V_.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um Yeah. So, that's \nproject manager: Can you go back one page? For the uh menu, what do we use for that? We don't have buttons for the menu.\nuser interface: Uh, well \nproject manager: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .\nuser interface: Yeah. I thought that was our uh idea.\nproject manager: Okay. But uh \nuser interface: So, uh how \nproject manager: You have to put it on the \nuser interface: Like this.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Or or this. And that the menu button is okay.\nproject manager: Yeah but, has to be clear that you can use the arrows.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: Uh, so the The icons on the arrows, as well, you mean.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Yes. The second one.\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh, well that's something to uh think about. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh, maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation. And you will see it.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already, or in the next uh meeting.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But uh, as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo, I would uh recommend a yellow case. Uh, round edges. The logo at the bottom. And uh, well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour. So, it's good. Uh, recognisable. K so, I think.\nproject manager: Not too much colours.\nuser interface: Uh, no. Not too much.\nproject manager: No, it's not flower power.\nuser interface: But uh No, no, no. But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and  {vocalsound}\nproject manager: S okay.\nuser interface: Uh, yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons, and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: That was that.\nproject manager: Thank you. So, you're next.\nindustrial designer: I'm next, okay. Yes. No. Here we go.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh, at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want,\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to. And then, I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs, about uh what battery is in it, what kind of buttons also. First uh, the younger people, they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours. Like, totally yellow, totally red. Uh, so it's visible. Uh, the shapes are curved and round, like uh you also said. Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones, straight and uh flat and long. But to give him the shape of your hand, so you it's easier to use or something like that. But that's just an idea. And then, I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control. The battery, there are few options. Uh, I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery. So, everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket. Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch. When you uh shake it a few times, it it's loaded. Uh, the the form of the remote control, I think it's also nice have it curved. And maybe like it's hand-shaped. Uh, so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons. Uh material, you use plastic. Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time. And also rubber because the younger people like that, what we see in the research. Uh the push-buttons. We have one new thing uh discovered. It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse. Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels. When you want to go m move up, you just scroll up and click on the button, if you wanna see the next, uh if you wanna see that channel. And also for the mouse, uh for the volume, it's also uh easy to use. Just scroll a bit up, scroll a bit down. And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this, and you get it here. You can do it with your thumb. And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh if you push uh channel one, you can see channel one. The electrics um with a scroll push uh button, we must use regular uh chips. There are also uh simple chips. They are uh cheaper. Um, but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control, and I think there are a lot of those uh things, and people won't buy it any more. They have seen enough of it. And you have also advanced um chips. But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen. And the costs will increase a lot more. And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_, and the chip who is more expensive. And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control, that we then use the primary colours. Like, you get a yellow uh remote control, red one, blue one, et cetera. You have any more questions about this? I think the main thing is we look at the costs.\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: And not too basic, not a basic remote control, who everybody already has.\nmarketing: Yeah. But, thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_? No,\nindustrial designer: Not with an L_C_D_.\nmarketing: not.\nproject manager: No, isn't.\nindustrial designer: No.\nproject manager: But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons. Then you can scroll, you see what number, and then you push.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But then, what I say, the costs will uh get a lot higher.\nproject manager: But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel. If you don't \nindustrial designer: Th then you'll see it on the television.\nproject manager: Hmm, yes. But then. Yeah, then you go one down one up. When you scroll.\nindustrial designer: but l when you see a menu uh on the television, it's like you see uh one to twenty, you go uh uh s scroll up, and push number tw twenty. Yeah\nproject manager: but like we said before, it has to be used on every television. Yeah So you may not be uh \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No. The television must do that. So \nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our uh remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room. And mostly they are smaller. So \nindustrial designer: Yes. But that won't be a problem. I think.\nproject manager: Most the times that are not advanced televisions.\nindustrial designer: No, but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And I think, what I said, everybody has them uh has them already. And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros. Uh, and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing. And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Uh, can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without?\nindustrial designer: I got it on my screen and it was uh higher. But I don't know uh how much higher. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'Cause it \nproject manager: That's important.\nmarketing: I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better.\nindustrial designer: That's true.\nmarketing: And that might uh bring back the costs uh \nindustrial designer: But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better. If we have a better shape of the um remote control, or better options on it. With a scroll menu, a w scroll thing, and a L_C_D_. And then a flat um remote control. Or, a more hand-shaped remote control, with scroll, without L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Yeah. Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: I can uh look on my uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's very important.\nindustrial designer: Uh Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip. A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip, which is a higher price range. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip.\nproject manager: Yeah, more expensive. But how much?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Doesn't say. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: Huh.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: That's from my manufacturing division.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'Kay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, thank you.\nindustrial designer: Yes?\nmarketing: My turn?\nproject manager: Next.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm. So So Yeah. So, my uh presentation is about trend-watching. Uh, I did some trend-watching. It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends. 'Cause if you don't, you won't sell. So, well how we did do that? Uh, well we made an investigation of the market, by Trendwatchers. They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan. Of course, well known for their uh trend uh trends. And well, uh what did you find? Uh, we have two groups, young and trendy, and the old and rich. Well th and the young and trendy, they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes, shoes, and also uh products. And um, material? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling. And to get a feeling for what it is, uh here is an image of it. Then the old and rich. They like uh dark colours, and simple, recognisable shapes.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And um, they also like uh familiar material, uh especially wood. Now, another picture.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: To get a feeling for this. Well, uh then already come to my personal preferences. We uh aim at the younger market. So, we should also be uh look at their uh trends. However, with trends it's always if there's it's now. It it it might last one year, and next year it be uh can be totally different. And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year. So, we m must not just only look at what the trend is now, as it might be totally different next year. So, that's uh one thing to keep in mind.\nindustrial designer: Changing covers. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. Any questions?\nindustrial designer: Nope.\nproject manager: No. It's clear.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: So now, it's uh Ah, let's see. Now, w we have to decide Well, we have to decide on the concept. So, we have to look at 'S next. Components and user interface concept. So Now, we have to make some concept. Maybe one of you can paint it on the board. First, uh user interface.\nindustrial designer: Uh, uh-uh. How w how we how we make it? Uh \nproject manager: Yes, a concept on uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just \nindustrial designer: Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but maybe we can paint it. Uh, what do we want?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but if I paint with \nproject manager: I'll paint. Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Something like this? Or Shapes or What do we need?\nuser interface: Mm, yes. What?\nmarketing: Can make several uh concepts.\nproject manager: Yes, okay.\nmarketing: We have this, and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: More like something \nmarketing: Yeah I I I uh yes. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it.\nproject manager: And you have to.\nindustrial designer: Uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I have to.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I'm not a designer. It's more three D_. Like, um when you have a part here. This is the remote control. And then you have something like th this under it. So, it's easier to get it like this.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's like a gun. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: A g {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, it has to be soft?\nmarketing: Mm. .\nindustrial designer: And it has to be soft, yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. And uh, the buttons?\nindustrial designer: So, you can squeeze in it and Sorry?\nproject manager: Buttons.\nindustrial designer: Buttons on top of it. And here. The scrolling. You can do it with your thumb.\nproject manager: No, it won't.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then?\nindustrial designer: But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here. One till uh uh zero till nine.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: But, well there one for the sound and one for the channels.\nuser interface: But but how \nindustrial designer: And the b\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. How \nindustrial designer: Yeah? Or two buttons.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Uh, two scroll uh wheels.\nmarketing: And i if we go to uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one, then we'll have just a switch on it, and you'll just switch it, and now it's the sound to switch back\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's th that's more difficult.\nmarketing: But if we have uh a me Yeah.\nproject manager: It's better in \nmarketing: If we have a menu, uh how do we uh choose other options?\nindustrial designer: with the menu uh button. And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it. Just not like all the other ones, with uh this thing, and uh here an arrow, here an arrow, here an arrow, here an arrow.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Because uh, from h hundred uh remote controls, ninety nine have it.\nproject manager: But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh, then we have it on the T_V_, the menu.\nmarketing: Uh-uh.\nproject manager: Yeah, but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You don't know. So, there's no menu.\nindustrial designer: I don't know. It's like some sort of uh teletext option, but we don't have teletext. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No. So you can't use it.\nindustrial designer: And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it, then the costs will uh be much higher.\nproject manager: Okay, we make two concepts. One with L_C_D_. One without L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay. But you all like this kind of thing. Uh \nproject manager: Good concept. But \nindustrial designer: With the scroll button.\nproject manager: That's one.\nindustrial designer: And and this one has to be soft.\nmarketing: Uh-uh.\nindustrial designer: And this has to be harder, because when it falls, it mu mu must not burst. Or some kind of rubber around it.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: It's one. Two. Number two.\nuser interface: And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Like uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: Ah that's nice.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Here. Trigger. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No. But when you handle it, you put it on and off.\nuser interface: Just to uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's not good to use.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but I'll zap.\nuser interface: Oh, like a \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Fuck. Out. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No, it's not good.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Now, second concept. One with L_C_D_, one without L_C_D_. Then uh Paint it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Paint it?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: With the scroll thing on, like this?\nproject manager: One with two scroll buttons and one with without. Yeah. Uh, one with a with a menu, and one without a menu.\nindustrial designer: So?\nproject manager: And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: Draw it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Unbelievable.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do I have to do everything. Blank. You have Not so difficult.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: But if you put push the the menu button \nproject manager: Uh, that's the menu. There for the L_C_D_ screen.\nuser interface: Yeah, wh what Yes, but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose.\nproject manager: You have to For the menu.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. One that way. And one that way. So Then it depends on the cost. S On and off.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But is it easy to use? When you have it on your left side, and \nproject manager: When it's not too big. Just like a a phone.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: M uh yeah, maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um\nindustrial designer: Separate, more separate, h yeah.\nmarketing: more separate, yeah.\nproject manager: Yes, okay.\nmarketing: Like, you have the menu button in between uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah. On the left a scroll button, and on the right a scroll button. But would it be easy to use then? If it's like you have a big uh \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Very good. Is it better? When you uh the menu, you have to go there there there there.\nindustrial designer: I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: They were like round curves, uh different uh \nproject manager: Yeah, okay. That's that's the outside. But now the \nindustrial designer: Okay, okay, okay.\nproject manager: First the buttons.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Think we have we have now two buttons missing. The uh um The mute button.\nproject manager: Sorry?\nmarketing: We have two buttons missing. The mute button. And um, the to to uh have to uh numbers\nproject manager: Mute. And the other.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah. Not so difficult.\nmarketing: But, uh \nindustrial designer: Personally, I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle.\nproject manager: But how do you wanna solve it?\nindustrial designer: With the switch button.\nproject manager: Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy.\nindustrial designer: No\nproject manager: Then you go down, you switch, you go into the right, you switch, you go down.\nindustrial designer: like uh Oh, you mean like that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh, then you can also have like uh th um \nproject manager: A joystick.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and joystick, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah. But is it uh Does that break, a joystick? Or a small one just like in a laptop.\nindustrial designer: Yeah like in a laptop, s uh s some sort of thing. A little bit bigger, with easier thi\nproject manager: Mean, it's better. But how expensive it is? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't know.\nproject manager: Oh. Why do I pay you for? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um, well um Better ideas. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Or no scroll uh things. Just a shape. And  No, no. It won't work.\nproject manager: For the young peoples I think scroll button's good.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh-huh.\nproject manager: So Think we have to keep them.\nindustrial designer: Or a remote control more like joystick.\nproject manager: Yeah, but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better. A small one.\nindustrial designer: A small one like this, like a Nintendo uh k\nproject manager: No just like in a\nindustrial designer: Playstation thing.\nproject manager: a laptop. Small, round.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Then it's not so big.\nindustrial designer: No, no, no. I mean the the shape of the remote control.\nproject manager: Oh the sh Yeah, but then you can \nindustrial designer: Just like a Playstation thing. Yeah.\nproject manager: So Maybe, if it's possible, it's not too expensive, I think a joystick is better.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: A small one. So, please look at it.\nindustrial designer: No, that's okay, I got \nmarketing: And on the L_C_D_, how much it costs? Uh, it costs extra?\nindustrial designer: Uh they're not uh in details.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's more expensive or less expensive, huh? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah we I think you get it. So, after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Then I have to come with it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: I got my personal costs. I I don't I don't know the costs.\nproject manager: Your problem. Not mine.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Then I'll uh make something up.\nproject manager: Okay. So, do we have other concepts? Then for the components, we use a normal battery. Then it's Ch cheapest way, I think.\nuser interface: Mm, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery.\nproject manager: No, no kinetic. Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think it's uh, yeah, more expensive. Yeah.\nproject manager: So we use a normal battery.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: Chip. Depends on the L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: Depends on the scroll.\nproject manager: Scroll.\nindustrial designer: If we use a scroll, then we have the uh regular chip. If we don't use a scroll, then we can use the simple chip.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And that's \nproject manager: And uh, we If you use the L_C_D_, we have to\nindustrial designer: Uh the most expensive.\nproject manager: Yes, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: So, depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll.\nindustrial designer: If we Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: If we No okay scroll-wheel. So, I have this. So, it will be uh the advanced chip, or the uh regu uh or the regular chip.\nproject manager: Okay. So, uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and But, it has to be small. I think.\nindustrial designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it?\nproject manager: If you have pistol, it L_C_D_'s not easy. Y y Yeah but \nindustrial designer: Just use your thumb.\nproject manager: If you use a phone.\nindustrial designer: If you Yeah. I use my thumb.\nproject manager: k Yeah, but but then you have it. Like, th if you have pistol, you have it so. And the screen is \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well, then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen.\nindustrial designer: If you have a joystick on No, if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And you move up, f forward, down, left. Then you have uh just, yeah, a little bit curved. It's not just uh straight.\nproject manager: No. No, no.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: That's how we use it. That's why they make joysticks like that, I think.\nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: Yeah, but then you look forward.\nmarketing: Uh, yeah, but \nproject manager: And then you can y\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nproject manager: N well, if you have to look at it.\nmarketing: If you \nindustrial designer: 'Kay. Here's our designer.\nmarketing: If we have uh then something standing here, with the L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Then it goes like this.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, why not.\nproject manager: If th n well {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's for the younger people.\nproject manager: Yes, of course.\nindustrial designer: It's something new. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's good good.\nuser interface: It's uh \nproject manager: But the um, it may not break.\nindustrial designer: Now we put uh rubber around it.\nproject manager: Okay. If that's possible.\nmarketing: Um, Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Hard plastic, uh the shape, and around it hard uh around it rubber. And the uh the hand shape is also rubber.\nmarketing: \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Or you can uh turn it inside.\nmarketing: I can't see the . But, uh the easy of {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But that's \nmarketing: uh, th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it.\nindustrial designer: Huh.\nuser interface: No, that's true.\nmarketing: Uh, for us it's about to sell it. Uh \nproject manager: Yeah of course.\nindustrial designer: This is something new.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Then this is the design. And the buttons are on the next page. So, depends on the cost. So,\nindustrial designer: Costs are okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: um we have one minute.\nuser interface: .\nmarketing: One.\nproject manager: I think. No.\nmarketing: No. You have more.\nproject manager: More. Seven.\nmarketing: You have still ten.\nproject manager: Next meeting. Thirty minutes. So hurry up.\nindustrial designer: Oh, that's us together.\nproject manager: You two stay here. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Paint it.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Now you have to.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think it's clear. Check your mail. So \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nproject manager: It has to be ready in the next meeting. So {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Cookie.\nmarketing: What? Okay.\nproject manager: Next meeting is called the detailed design. So Everyth everything has to be ready. Thanks for your attention. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay.\nmarketing: See you at the next meeting.\nindustrial designer: Bye bye.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "Firstly, User Interface suggested trendy and one-color cases, good icons on the big buttons since they would be recognizable and excite the young people. Secondly, Industrial Designer introduced that young people favored soft materials and primary colors, but trendy design on the button and the use of LCD display would increase cost since the budget had always been a big problem.

There we go. Okay, so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria. And now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Can you read that? Almost.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: More or less. Um I started filling it in, but of course these are provisional, so we have to go down. No hand dynamo, right?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: One simple battery.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: No kinetic energy, no solar. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print.\nindustrial designer: Advanced, yeah.\nproject manager: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker.\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Um single-curved surface, so that we can fold it.\nuser interface: Yeah, yes.\nproject manager: Case material we said rubber.\nuser interface: Rubber.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: I don't know what special colour means.\nindustrial designer: Mm anything uh I think which is not more .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think something coloured, yeah, probably. So I think this is probably special co no?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It could be \nmarketing: Yeah, but rubber comes coloured, doesn't it? You know.\nproject manager: Rub rubber comes coloured,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured, it's different.\nuser interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it,\nproject manager: Yeah, let's leave it as zero, 'cause it's easy. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: you might end up having to take off the sample sensor.\nproject manager: We we're definitely going to have to \nuser interface: We have pushbuttons,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: so we've got pushbutton, and then we've\nuser interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well.\nproject manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had, no?\nindustrial designer: No uh we we have uh yeah.\nuser interface: S yeah, yeah, we had, for muting, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And we have L_C_ display\nproject manager: And button supplements.\nuser interface: and yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm no.\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: . No.\nindustrial designer: We don't have \nproject manager: No. No?\nindustrial designer: we're not using any of that.\nuser interface: Yeah, but what do we ha we have L_C_ display, but but the wh but the s spinning wheel \nproject manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there. I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though,\nuser interface: Okay, let's yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: haven't we?\nproject manager: I think the pushbutton oh.\nmarketing: 'Cause then you have \nproject manager: I don't know if that's one \nmarketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it? Not counting anything, we'd still be in budget.\nproject manager: Yeah. That seems unlikely.\nindustrial designer: Huh?\nproject manager: Push what uh\nindustrial designer: Wh wh what is the limit? Uh.\nmarketing: Twelve point five.\nproject manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we \nuser interface: We have to count all of them, or yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm I don't think so, no.\nproject manager: I don't think that makes sense.\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface,\nmarketing: Well it doesn't, but it uh \nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five, it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display,\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: And L_C_ display.\nindustrial designer: so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah. So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here.\nindustrial designer: Wh wh what's our criteria?\nmarketing: This sample sensor .\nproject manager: Our budget's twelve point five.\nindustrial designer: Uh okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there.\nproject manager: Yeah, so that has implications though for the .\nindustrial designer: Uh it does not have for voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: For the locator.\nmarketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really, isn't it?\nindustrial designer: Mm and the locator also goes away.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: We can afford to get rid of it.\nuser interface: But it was very no innovative\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So that means no locator, does it?\nuser interface: innovativeness . Well um yeah.\nmarketing: I mean does \nproject manager: What else does it need?\nuser interface: Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive, but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps.\nproject manager: Yeah, 'cause the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated then just a beeping thing.\nuser interface: This would be Yeah, yeah yeah {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: there you record your samples your speech samples and \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay, so we \nindustrial designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber, so it's probably a flat surface rubber. Uh I mean uh um yeah.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: Okay, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um \nproject manager: Right, so we need one fifty off.\nmarketing: See, I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing, 'cause \nproject manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel. We could do \nindustrial designer: So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_?\nuser interface: Yeah, then then we would be in the b budget.\nindustrial designer: If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll, right? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button.\nuser interface: Yeah b no no, you can push this one, but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing.\nmarketing: But that's well you would just have to to spin it down .\nproject manager: Yeah. You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: No w w w but ha\nmarketing: So that's point three.\nindustrial designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing.\nuser interface: But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: If you \nmarketing: I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more. That's the spin wheel though, isn't it? Didn't that come with the L_C_ \nproject manager: That's with the L_C_\nindustrial designer: That comes with the L_C_D_?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: We decided, 'cause it's not on our list.\nindustrial designer: Oh so so the the this is \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: The scroll wheel is on the side.\nindustrial designer: . So we're adding costs for right, okay uh I mean I think this is good.\nmarketing: S so we're point three over.\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: We're point three over at the moment.\nmarketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether\nproject manager: It's nothing n\nmarketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume. Could b still put them on the side. But yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nmarketing: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool, but \nproject manager: I have \nindustrial designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: On the side.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm uh it sounds good actually, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay, yeah.\nproject manager: Rather than having three different things that people have to do.\nindustrial designer: .\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: There we go. Oh look, we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses.\nmarketing: Yeah, well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour.\nmarketing: Yeah, but \nproject manager: So that's alright. We we'll leave it at that \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour, if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it,\nindustrial designer: We have, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Excellent. Alright. So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria, as a result of doing that?\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: Not really, no.\nmarketing: No, I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep L_C_D_ display.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway,\nindustrial designer: Um yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But we lose the locator.\nproject manager: Alright then.\nmarketing: Really?\nproject manager: We're gonna have a beep.\nuser interface: Well we're going to have a beeping thing.\nindustrial designer: So instead of speaker, .\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But yeah, it's it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep, so we still have the locate.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Cool. That's not a very exciting colour. I think you should make it more vegetable-like. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Tha\nuser interface: Which colour, the the colour of the phone or the colour of the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh the the beeper thing.\nproject manager: .\nmarketing: It \nuser interface: But it can be yellow as well. It can come in the same colour as the the case.\nproject manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I think Jen wants it to vibrate.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, I know I know, my pen vibrates.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You know, your pen vibrates?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But only for a very short time.

Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting, so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went, um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product.\nindustrial designer: I think it mm \nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Feedback? Ideas?\nuser interface: Yeah mm, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah I think there was there was room for creativity. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um we kap kept a adding things randomly.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So, had we known \nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that or not, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.

{"fname": "product_dev_10", "dialogue": "marketing: Or not. Uh. Oh there we go. Perfect. Okay. So this is me. Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices. Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's used to using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, m the majority of the time that's all that's going on, the other functions happen, for some people they're important, but the primary uses are really really basic. Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use, they're not using a lot of it, they don't need it, they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with. And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people, their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, will really come into play with a lot of these people. Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful, and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically, that's up to the design people, but it is s something worth thinking about, especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing, so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about. Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards. So it's a good start for us.\nproject manager: That's great. Thank you Sarah. Right. So um\nmarketing: Need to unplug this?\nproject manager: yep I'll just uh switch that back here.\nmarketing: Need it back.\nproject manager: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase.\nmarketing: There you go.\nproject manager: Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Um Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to, you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted, thought about voice control,\nmarketing: Oh right.\nproject manager: um so do we wanna go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic, and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes.

Anyway,\nuser interface: I didn't receive it yet.\nproject manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly, um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already. Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings, um specifically the whiteboard over there. Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it. And then that's it. So we've got twenty five minutes to do that, that's until eleven twenty five.\nindustrial designer: so sh\nproject manager: S so any any questions?\nindustrial designer: .\nproject manager: Is i not at this point.\nuser interface: Not at this point.\nproject manager: So this is our project. What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television. Um we want it to be something original, something trendy and also something user friendly, so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product. The method that we're going to use to complete the project, that has three components as such. There's the functional design of the the remote control. We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that. Um similarly with the conceptual design, we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together. Um and then the detailed design will come after that. We'll pull it all together.\nindustrial designer: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design? Uh i is it just uh more detail, uh as I understand it?\nproject manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: and what what specific things it it has to do\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing.\nindustrial designer: How how it will be done. So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product?\nproject manager: Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: yeah. Okay, so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself. Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project, specifically the whiteboard.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: So each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard, the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name, what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Why are you looking at me?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Would you like to go first? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Do I have a choice? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.

Okay um I'll do some I'll rub the features\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and let the drawing stay. 'Kay um my name is Gaurav.

I've got no idea how to draw a cow.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good luck.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh this is going to be \nmarketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that'll do.\nmarketing: and then just some horns.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so let let me draw the body first.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Big, round body, really skinny legs {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and they've got a long tail\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and a long face. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's eating.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It looks like Eeyore. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And there is some grass there.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So this is what I like about cows {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Horns,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass,\nmarketing: draw some horns. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: they do not disturb anybody um\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So yeah, I like cows. Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer, so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role, what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design, what are the various components of it and um finally, I'm not too sure what was the last part. Um the detailed design, I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other. Um I'm from India. Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics, I sit at the Department of Psychology. Yeah. Thank you.\nproject manager: Excellent.\nuser interface: Thanks.\nproject manager: Right, now now it's my turn obviously. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow, does it? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, here's a space.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It looks very very cute.\nproject manager: Yeah, I like the cow.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: I'm Jen.\nuser interface: Yeah. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um I like dogs too, but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I like Mm.\nmarketing: Is that a lizard?\nindustrial designer: No way. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Hmm.\nuser interface: Wow.\nproject manager: It's a gecko.\nindustrial designer: Ah okay.\nuser interface: Ah, a gecko, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Is there a difference?\nuser interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they \nproject manager: They're Yeah, they're l it's a kind of lizard.\nuser interface: yeah, they are\nproject manager: And I I like geckos\nuser interface: mm-hmm.\nproject manager: because they remind me of warm places {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nproject manager: and, and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house\nuser interface: Ah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I hope you don't like snakes, do you?\nproject manager: I don't like snakes. I come from Australia\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and we have nasty snakes. That's where I'm from, Australia.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way, so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product.\nuser interface: Wonderful.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Thank you.\nproject manager: So, let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation. So, I've just thought \nmarketing: If you right click on it you can \nproject manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: there we go. Okay, so this is the um overall budget for our project. We've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away, that means we've got five minutes. Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each. Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the U_K_. Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target. So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing. Okay. Hmm. This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing, okay. We've only got a couple of minutes. Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control?\nuser interface: Yep. I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary.\nindustrial designer: I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy, user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned, that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this.\nproject manager: Something something new.\nmarketing: Yeah, I was looking at the website,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures. So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional, you know?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So I'm kind of thinking, you know like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: You know, so something heading towards that, so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls, so I figure how many do you need, you know?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing, or \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this, like I mean you know, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But what do most people do?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: They turn it on, they watch certain specified channels, you know, and then they turn it off again.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time,\nmarketing: Sometimes they play a movie.\nindustrial designer: but will be used ten percent of the time, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, so\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that,\nproject manager: So, no.\nmarketing: maybe to do \nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: It could be one button for a menu or something, if you really need to go and do that.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And then use the \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So, if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works, then you know that's fine\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons, which just confuse them. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: Excellent.\nmarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train, it's just very like, there's no extra bits on it, the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nproject manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet, yep.\nmarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people, but it looks really pretty too.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: Great. Any other immediate thoughts before we move along?\nindustrial designer: Mm. Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things, but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life, although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway, battery life,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries. Um \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones, because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\nindustrial designer: Yeah. A big learning curve, yeah.\nuser interface: with l learning, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. So, i it should kind of fit in as well, and the stereotype of a \nproject manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: Hm-hmm.\nproject manager: because you have no idea how to get in, but the designers thought they were great. Okay, so we need to wrap it up now, so that we can go away and get on with some of this. Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes, so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace, but im basically you're looking at the working design,\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: you're looking at the technical functions design, and for you it's the user requirements specification,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: like you said at the start. Okay? Thanks for that.\nuser interface: Okay. Thank you.\nproject manager: Uh I'll see you in half an hour.\nindustrial designer:.\nuser interface: See you.\nproject manager: Carry the laptops back again.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Do we need to unplug things?

{"fname": "product_dev_59", "dialogue": "marketing: Well, I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um to start with these points. Uh next sheet? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls, because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things. Uh, furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use. Um then I tell something about um the most important issues. So we have to focus on those three thing three things. And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users, customers. Well, um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's seventy five per cent of the current users. They don't like it, so we might think about fronts in that section. Um They also say, that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent, uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls. So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control. Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions. Uh, almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity. So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy. Furthermore, it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot. Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle, so you can reach it with your thumb.\nindustrial designer: You can zap away. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right. A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television, that's your um your control beeps or something, that you can find this very easily.\nproject manager: Well {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I dunno, maybe that's an idea.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control, within the same room.\nindustrial designer: Oh?\nproject manager: It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: because it can also be used for other televisions. So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television, that bleeps to your remote control, everyone can use it.\nmarketing: Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device?\nproject manager: No you can click it on your television.\nmarketing: Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something?\nproject manager: Yeah in another room, yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well yes.\nmarketing: Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So Well a beeping device would be \nproject manager: Well we'll have a look at it, yeah.\nmarketing: Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem. Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn. So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote, of course. Uh \nmarketing: Yeah but people don't read manuals.\nindustrial designer: I didn't read it?\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Oh, alright.\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: users to uh add one? Do you think?\nuser interface: I don't think \nmarketing: I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use, than a manual.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah alright. Because they don't use it? Alright.\nproject manager: Well there sh should always be a menu,\nmarketing: Yeah. Right.\nproject manager: but it c can be very short.\nmarketing: And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes.\nuser interface: Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control, I think.\nproject manager: Yes okay.\nindustrial designer: Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it?\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Yeah right. It sh it should be there, the manual. But but not to explain how the remote works. Only \nmarketing: And we don't have much time. So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design. So you can pick up and use it, than I think.\nproject manager: Well we are a design team,\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point.\nindustrial designer: Isn't it part of the of the u\nmarketing: Yeah right, right.\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No. No. Never mind.\nproject manager: Well we'll have a look. Um yes?\nmarketing: Next point. Um R_S_I_.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well that's about twenty per cent I thought. But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat? Yeah, consider the consequences of using your remote.\nindustrial designer: Consider the m Yeah.\nmarketing: It should be a good in your hand. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: Right, this is the most important part. Um, we're Like the requirements said, we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience. Um, that's about sixty per cent of the market, so it's uh quite important. Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device. Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty, ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that.\nproject manager: Well \nmarketing: So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs.\nproject manager: Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost, we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh \nindustrial designer: It's going to be expensive. Yeah.\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: Yeah but they think it's really important.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of uh of the stuff, maybe we can uh buy it very cheap, I dunno. We have to uh \nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: Well we'll uh consider it uh.\nproject manager: Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh \nindustrial designer: We'll think abo we'll think \nmarketing: Yeah, I don't know. I don't have any information on that. So {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nigh\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I know. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No, we'll look we'll look into that later. Alright?\nmarketing: Right. And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition. They also like that,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but research is very uh costly. So \nuser interface: I think that's uh difficult to realise also.\nmarketing: Yeah, but it it might be important for the sale.\nindustrial designer: We have very demanding clients.\nproject manager: It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so \nuser interface: No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think.\nproject manager: We sh\nmarketing: Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition.\nproject manager: Yeah absolutely.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we might consider L_C_D_ screens.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, alright. Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find, I think.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: We don't rule them out uh yet.\nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Alright. Um, I think that's it. Um \nproject manager: Alright.\nmarketing: I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: So you can Right.\nproject manager: Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation.\nmarketing: Yeah.

{"fname": "product_dev_66", "dialogue": "project manager: Okay, so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: and then we'll there \nindustrial designer: Yeah, see the budget.\nproject manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues, but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and cut some of the prices that way.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Wales. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Wales, for example. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm. Cool, okay. Right, okay. Fabulous,\nproject manager: Marketing Expert.\nmarketing: yeah. Okay, cool. So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design. Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so one is, you know, yes, it totally meets with that requirement and seven is, no, it really doesn't, we need to go back and start again. Um, you know. Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. Um you know, so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah, we did manage to do that, or oh no, we really forgot about that.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Cool, so these are what they are. Oh \nproject manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. Is that right?\nmarketing: Yes, I did have A_, B_, C_, and D_ down here, but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points.\nproject manager: Mm dots, never mind.\nmarketing: Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_, B_, C_, and D_, then that would be really good.\nindustrial designer: I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, the yeah, it's definitely attractive. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, I agree.\nuser interface: Oh, the locatable thing we actually forgot.\nmarketing: Well, I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_?\nproject manager: Yeah, just prepare one now.\nuser interface: Yeah. Shall I just prepare it now?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: It will be red, too.\nmarketing: Cool. Okay. So, be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say?\nindustrial designer: So?\nproject manager: I reckon it \nuser interface: S seven was th the maximum, yeah?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I I go for seven.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: Oh we're all so proud of the .\nproject manager: Seven, yeah, it's terribly sexy. Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, so that'll be a seven for A_.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Could oh no, you can't whilst that's up there. Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in.\nproject manager: Ah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Excellent. Except we can't \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But we can we can \nmarketing: But that's alright.\nproject manager: uh we can if we \nindustrial designer: I can I can take note uh uh \nmarketing: If you take a note of them, and then I'll put them in in a minute.\nproject manager: then yeah, I'll take a note, it's fine.\nmarketing: Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven for A_?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Cool, okay. Does it match the operating behaviour of the user?\nindustrial designer: Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people,\nproject manager: I think it does.\nuser interface: I would think yes, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. I mean \nindustrial designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nproject manager: Alright.\nuser interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But that's gonna be a problem,\nindustrial designer: But then yeah.\nproject manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem,\nmarketing: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen.\nindustrial designer: because i i it is operatable.\nuser interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: so they just \nmarketing: Yeah, but I mean because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-handed people can't normally write right-handed,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: but they can normally do most things right-handed,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: so I would say it's not such a big issue.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, because I mean anyway, right-handed people would be able to scroll with it,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: so i if the majority are right-handed, it's uh \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation, maybe give it a five, I would say?\nproject manager: Um \nmarketing: What do you what do you all think?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Six.\nuser interface: Or maybe six, because it's just one one i one among the issues,\nproject manager: Yeah, I think I think for um \nuser interface: I mean. Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean most people are right-handed, so in in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good, but we might want to flag it for management, they want might want to um \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: One more thing is that i\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right,\nproject manager: They \nindustrial designer: so it opens on the side. So \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: No, yeah, but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah, I mean yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it won't be a problem,\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So you guys can decide wh whether \nuser interface: it will be and it will be it won't be heavy.\nindustrial designer: Oops.\nmarketing: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah well yeah,\nproject manager: The length is gonna be difficu\nuser interface: but it's it's a bit long. It's a little bit long.\nmarketing: Yeah um \nuser interface: Well, I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah.\nmarketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah?\nindustrial designer: Uh this this kind of uh makes it more \nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Because \nuser interface: S uh slightly smaller.\nindustrial designer: and two, it might interfere with the I_R_ channel.\nmarketing: So you have to keep that side flat.\nuser interface: Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping, but y you know, as long as that side's flat, than that will work.\nindustrial designer: Right. Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. Um okay, so C_. Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_?\nindustrial designer: No, we have a locator.\nproject manager: No, we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot.\nmarketing: There's a locator. Cool, so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though,\nuser interface: Mm that you stick on T_V_.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: doesn't it? To make it beep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Or a buzzer.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included, so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds, so yeah.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So that's two, so that's seven, yeah. It's locatable?\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Fabulous. D_.\nindustrial designer: Intuitive, completely intuitive. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. If uh uh if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and it's I th I think it's \nproject manager: I'd say six, 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. I really like the way you have it,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to.\nindustrial designer: Intuitive.\nmarketing: Yeah, and I mean d\nindustrial designer: And uh even the scroll, it's a it's a new technology\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni\nproject manager: Might be \nindustrial designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology, I mean once they get used to it.\nproject manager: But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: So, should we maybe say f a five\nindustrial designer: So l\nmarketing: and say it is intuitive,\nproject manager: Five?\nmarketing: but it's different, so, do you know, I mean it's obvious how to use it,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: but you might have to think about it first. So we give that one a five, you think?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay. I'm gonna give a seven in everything, so. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: I'm happy with five?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm glad you're accepting this. It has taken a little while, hasn't it? Um intuitive but Sorry, it's really hard to write on those.\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I just went a bit mad, didn't I?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um okay, cool, E_, okay. Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here, so possibly for left-handed. Investigate.\nproject manager: Yep. But otherwise it's superb.\nmarketing: So, should we give it a six?\nproject manager: Six.\nmarketing: Six?\nuser interface: Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: well mm I mean I d uh I dunno, I mean the the repetitive stress things,\nindustrial designer: .\nuser interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, unless you are a all the time sitting.\nuser interface: yeah? See.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so it's kinda \nindustrial designer: Yeah, I I think it is ergonomic.\nmarketing: I used to send fifty texts a day, you know,\nproject manager: Well we've banned them from \nmarketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest.\nindustrial designer: And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's varied.\nmarketing: Okay, so we give that a six,\nproject manager: Yeah. Six?\nmarketing: yeah. Okay, F_.\nuser interface: Yeah,  it does have yeah.\nindustrial designer: Absolutely.\nproject manager: Voice control have seven.\nmarketing: Hang on, how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there? That's just \nproject manager: Ah, that's the second one. So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score, but not on the previous slide.\nmarketing: Oh okay, cool. Um right, so.\nindustrial designer: So it has voice control.\nmarketing: Yes, so that's a seven then.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: Um, cool.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: G_ technologically innovative.\nindustrial designer: Anyway it ha yeah,\nuser interface: Technologi well \nindustrial designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually new.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well, which is yeah, it's kind of new.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, but I mean you don't \nproject manager: All of the components have been used in other things before.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but they've been brought together in a remote.\nuser interface: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new.\nmarketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think.\nproject manager: But do yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: .\nproject manager: What do you reckon, five, six?\nmarketing: Yeah, what do you all think?\nuser interface: Six.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Six?\nuser interface: I mean how how far can you go with a remote control, really?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, that's it, I mean \nuser interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really, hasn't it?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So, I don't think many peop\nproject manager: Space remote.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's it, they can take it with them.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Put fashion in electronics.\nindustrial designer: Absolutely. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, isn't it fashionable?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The carrot banana remote. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, sure.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's the maximum fashion.\nmarketing: So, we give it seven, and we write \nuser interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days, so.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: There we go.\nindustrial designer: I think that's a .\nuser interface: So I think we've done very well, but \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Very good.\nuser interface: What's the assessment?\nmarketing: So, we need the average here, so we got \nuser interface: The average is about six and something.\nproject manager: Yeah, one.\nuser interface: A little bit over six.\nmarketing: Seven \nindustrial designer: There are how many sixes?\nproject manager: Or a seven.\nindustrial designer: One, two, three.\nmarketing: So we've got four sevens,\nuser interface: No, wait, a little bit under six.\nmarketing: so that's twenty eight,\nindustrial designer: Three.\nuser interface: No, wait.\nmarketing: three sixes,\nindustrial designer: And one five.\nmarketing: eighteen.\nuser interface: Oh, three sixes, okay, yeah.\nproject manager: Fifty one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\nindustrial designer: Okay, twenty eight, thirty eight, fo forty six. Forty six and five, fifty one.\nproject manager: Six point point \nindustrial designer: Fifty one divided by \nuser interface: Six point something, yeah.\nmarketing: Two three four Seven eight.\nproject manager: about six point five.\nuser interface: Six point five, yeah.\nproject manager: Close enough.\nmarketing: Okay, that's pretty good, I think. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's all you've got at the moment, or did you have anything more?\nmarketing: Um no, that's it,\nproject manager: That's it?\nmarketing: yeah.", "en_query": "Summarize the presentation on evaluation criteria.", "zh_query": "总结产品评估标准。", "fr_query": "Résumez la présentation sur les critères d'évaluation.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте презентацію щодо критеріїв оцінки.", "en_summary": "The group gave a high score in terms of a fashion look, the ease of use, the locator, the scroll wheel, the LCD screen as well as the voice recognition technology.

{"fname": "product_dev_37", "dialogue": "user interface: Not at this point.\nproject manager: there we go. Okay, so this is the um overall budget for our project. We've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away, that means we've got five minutes. Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each. Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the U_K_. Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target. So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing. Okay. Hmm. This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing, okay. We've only got a couple of minutes. Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control?\nuser interface: Yep. I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary.\nindustrial designer: I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy, user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned, that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this.\nproject manager: Something something new.\nmarketing: Yeah, I was looking at the website,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures. So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional, you know?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So I'm kind of thinking, you know like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: You know, so something heading towards that, so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls, so I figure how many do you need, you know?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing, or \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this, like I mean you know, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But what do most people do?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: They turn it on, they watch certain specified channels, you know, and then they turn it off again.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time,\nmarketing: Sometimes they play a movie.\nindustrial designer: but will be used ten percent of the time, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, so\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that,\nproject manager: So, no.\nmarketing: maybe to do \nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: It could be one button for a menu or something, if you really need to go and do that.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And then use the \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So, if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works, then you know that's fine\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons, which just confuse them. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: Excellent.\nmarketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train, it's just very like, there's no extra bits on it, the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing\nproject manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet, yep.\nmarketing: um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people, but it looks really pretty too.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: Great. Any other immediate thoughts before we move along?\nindustrial designer: Mm. Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things, but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life, although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway, battery life,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries. Um \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones, because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems", "en_query": "What did the group discuss about the design goal of the remote control?", "zh_query": "针对该款遥控器，开发团队提出了哪些设计目标？", "fr_query": "De quoi le groupe a-t-il discuté concernant l'objectif de conception de la télécommande ?", "ukr_query": "Що у групі говорили про цілі проекту пульту дистанційного керування?", "en_summary": "They wanted it to be original, trendy, user-friendly, durable, creative and characteristic, so it can be very intuitive that people could use the product.

{"fname": "product_dev_29", "dialogue": "project manager: Excellent. So um I sent you the agenda, it was on the in the project documents. I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it. Anyway, it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time, so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with, so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts, so that's we need to know about the components' properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Okay. Um, do you wanna start again?\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Let me \nindustrial designer: Right s {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we've got forty minutes.\nindustrial designer: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation,\nproject manager: You haven't made a PowerPoint, okay.\nindustrial designer: yeah, I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um mm, {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Let's hope the pen holds out. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: okay, so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components. Yeah. Okay, so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote, right? If you open it, you have a circuit board here, right,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here, which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here. If you flip the printed circuit board, and this is th the most important point here,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh everything else is kind of Okay, so if you flip the circuit board, this is what it looks like. So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: on pressing this button I a circuit completes, the information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation, which goes goes out through there. So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make, you can ge get them printed as you want to,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost, the way we want to have. Right? So that's the important point here,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so these are the different options that we have. Okay. So the batteries, I'll start with the battery, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells, yeah?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes, right? So. And dynamos. Um {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Does that mean like a wind-up one?\nindustrial designer: yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: A wind-up remote.\nindustrial designer: So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but these are the different things that the company makes, so th they'll they'll \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: since uh they'll come internally from the company, they'll be eas uh cheaper, uh all these options.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones.\nmarketing: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike, and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And charging their remote,\nmarketing: Yeah, and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing, 'cause that's just \nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's a good option.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So what was what was this k ka\nindustrial designer: The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Uh yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. For a remote, 'cause you Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also made by the company.\nmarketing: Yay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Environment friendly. Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases, they can be flat, they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and they can be curved with on both the sides.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: These are the three options, right? Um \nuser interface: Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control, yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, would it be flat on both the sides, would be curved from one side, or whatever {vocalsound}\nuser interface: mm-hmm. Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh there were different kind of supplements available, um like it can be in plastic, rubber, wood, or titanium, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Wo wo wood.\nmarketing: Did you say wool?\nproject manager: Wood, wood.\nmarketing: Wood. Oh right.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Not wool. {vocalsound}\nmarketing:.\nproject manager: A fluffy remote. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, you'll understand why when we get to my presenta.\nindustrial designer: Oh really? Okay. Um the \nproject manager: Huh.\nindustrial designer: so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment, so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use, because it relates to the overall image of the company, but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface. If we choose this, we cannot use titanium. For for these two we can use titanium, wood, rubber, or plastic.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh okay, the interface options now. So we can have push-buttons, like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Ooh. Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh \nmarketing: Sony.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, something like that.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: So, and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: The scroll plus push. So this is something that has been recently developed by the company, um in the last decade, so not too recent. And L_C_D_s, we can have L_C_D_s. So these two are recent and and this is q quite old.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: The various electronic options are um uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one, right? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive, so we can put put in uh whatever we want, but the various integrated circuit options are, we have either a simple one\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: or a regular or advanced. And uh the price goes up as we go down, obviously.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um okay, so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels. Right? Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender, which is did not explained what i what it was, but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker. So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know, as soon as you press a button, it it mm uh give gives you feedback, one five or whatever. Yeah, on.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not, but anyway.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So, these are the different options that we have. Okay, so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know, uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that, keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Excellent. Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board, so that if we need to \nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure. Yeah.\nproject manager: you can sit down, but just we might need you to leap up.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: What are you, PowerPoint, or \nuser interface: Um I have some PowerPoint, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Oh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand?\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Some sort of radiation?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No it's got its little camera in there, plug it in .\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it should should do it. Yeah.\nmarketing: 'S a\nproject manager: Right, interface concept.\nuser interface: Okay. Um to be honest actually, I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time, I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk.\nproject manager: That's fine.\nuser interface: So um yeah, this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Okay. So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data. So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well, and colour, and so on.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant. Um and then um this uh this um this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So some findings um um. So in in the case of many user interfaces, they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing, it takes y know time to learn. Um okay, and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. Okay, some of them are here.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um well the picture is not very clear, but as you can see, there are actu oi, oh oh oh, {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: sorry for that. 'S go back.\nindustrial designer: That's nice one.\nuser interface: Ah, no, please. Okay, so yeah, they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one, because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice.\nmarketing: Ugly.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Um okay. So let's carry on with this. Um So uh um o other findings um some new things um used, uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh. Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait, no this is not the one. Okay, there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display.\nproject manager: It's yeah.\nuser interface: Um s another new development is a scroll button, which was also th also already mentioned. And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition, but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker, there can be a um pre-programmed answer, for example, you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever.\nproject manager: Uh-huh, hi yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include.\nindustrial designer: Uh sorry, uh can you go back for a second? Um uh are you sure wha what this means, a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display? Uh oh yeah are th\nproject manager: It's like the like you said, no? The scroll scroll wheel.\nmarketing: Yeah, you can't \nuser interface: No no, the scroll button is a different thing. I I have a picture if you just a moment, I'll I'll show you. I wasn't completely sure myself, but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel, it's like not separate buttons.\nindustrial designer: Oh okay, the iPod thing, yeah.\nuser interface: Look, this one here.\nmarketing: Oh, it's like the iPod.\nuser interface: But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round,\nmarketing: G yeah, no, you can.\nuser interface: it's like you press this or this or \nindustrial designer: Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh \nmarketing: It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse, and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Alright, right. Okay, okay.\nmarketing: and it yeah. It is \nindustrial designer: So instead of going down you just spin yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: You just go round\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and it is a bit weird at first, but it's actually very like fast.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Do you know, if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_, then it's a lot faster than the wheel,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: but you've got a lot less control over it.\nindustrial designer: Right. So maybe I should include that here as well,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: L_C_D_s um plus spinning.\nuser interface: Uh \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay, and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: It it has to be small, simple. Okay, we decided to include voice recognition, so to have the standard uh major buttons like on, off, um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen. Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button, I thought it could be for for voice like, I dunno, it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something. There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So yeah, that's uh that's it.\nproject manager: Excellent. Okay, straight to trends, and then we can discuss it all at once.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Okay, I've put the copy of the presentation in um the \nproject manager: The project documents.\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: Excellent. If you two could both do that as well, in case we need to refer to it.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Here it comes. Okay.\nmarketing: Fabulous. Okay, cool. Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay. Right. Now, the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect, which is twice as important as the third a aspect. So, I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: which I think given the target group is what you would expect, really.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um, you know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different, so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like, quite the thing to go for.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: And um, yeah it wants to look fancy, fancy look and feel.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here?\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right. So mm uh so it {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's over on the interface,\nindustrial designer: yeah,\nproject manager: if if you could put \nindustrial designer: so probably voice recognition is is kind of important, right?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um and an\nproject manager: And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning \nindustrial designer: yeah. Okay, I I have a point about L_C_D_,\nproject manager: so that means we need an advanced thing.\nindustrial designer: I dunno if it is the right point to take it up. W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback, right, to the user who's pressing buttons,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: and the feedback can come through television itself, so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote?\nmarketing: Depends how fast your television runs, really, don't don't you think? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait, and then it comes, so i it actually takes quite a long time. And if you get the number in wrong, then it's a bit of a pain,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right. \nmarketing: so I think, you know, a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that. But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen,\nmarketing: You know? Yeah.\nproject manager: so if you're watching something \nindustrial designer: That's true, yeah, that's also \nmarketing: And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on, and you could just see that on the remote rather than \nproject manager: Yeah. Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone, you know, like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control, you know or like a minimalist remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So you got your buttons one to nine, your on and off and your volume on that\nindustrial designer: Mm right.\nmarketing: and then if you want to mess about with it, you flip it open and,\nproject manager: And then you can flip it open.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: yeah.\nindustrial designer: So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and \nproject manager: Yeah, I think so.\nmarketing: Yeah, so that kind of decides your whole chip thing.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: You you agree? Maarika, yeah?\nuser interface: Yep, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Right.\nindustrial designer: So L_C_D_s, yeah, definitely.\nmarketing: Okay?\nindustrial designer: Go on.\nmarketing: Cool. Okay, apparently, fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sorry, I discovered clip art. Um so these will be an important feature for clothes, shoes and furniture. So I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, curviness. Do you know? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables. You know?\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: and possibly even uneven,\nmarketing: Yeah, bit of asymmetry and stuff.\nproject manager: like not not symmet yeah.\nmarketing: But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Um yeah\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing:, I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Um \nproject manager: Something a bit squishy and \nmarketing: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we we have\nmarketing: but I mean y you have to \nuser interface: So it could be like a rubbery \nindustrial designer: we have rubber,\nuser interface: yeah, uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using \nmarketing: Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, and it'd help if you drop it, it protects it as well.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: To some degree.\nindustrial designer: So if if we use uh latex cases, they won't allow us to use solar cells, as an energy source that is the constraint,\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: so um we could use titanium, wood or plastic uh or uh \nproject manager: Or if we want to use the the latex, then we have to go with one of the other um power things.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, w energy source.\nmarketing: If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there,\nproject manager: From from bouncing it.\nmarketing: you could just bounce it up and down.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, tap it on the desk, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You can have it as like a little ball to bounce, that flips open. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. Um so yeah, um okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm. So probably double curved surface is the way to go, yeah, .\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nindustrial designer: Or or curved at one end and flat on the top, because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides, then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons, etcetera. Um \nmarketing: You have to have a certain element of flatness, I think.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it, you know, it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much, does it?\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: It uh \nmarketing: No, I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference. I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: but it's curvy, so.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think uh \nproject manager: Yeah, 'cause the \nmarketing: Besides, you have four sides to a thing, so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: and, you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing?\nindustrial designer: Right. Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh\nproject manager: Dunno.\nindustrial designer: because um according to the information that I have, I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three. Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It does not say anything about uh whether technically, you know, this this stuff is available at all.\nproject manager: Nothing to open them.\nmarketing: Yeah. Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_, which I think is where it came from.\nindustrial designer: Right, yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: But no, my research didn't tell me anything, which is why we have all the pictures,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right. Okay.\nmarketing: Okay, cool.\nproject manager: Anything else? What've we got?\nmarketing: Uh combine style with a level of functionality, um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function.\nindustrial designer: Cool, thanks.\nproject manager: Okay, so.\nmarketing: Okay?\nuser interface: Thanks\nproject manager: Looking at what we've got, we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Let's let's try to r rub off things and \nproject manager: Yeah, rub off some of those.\nindustrial designer: yeah, so um {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: hand dynamos are definitely out, right? You you got a wind dynamo, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah uh-hum yeah.\nproject manager: it's not that's not streamlined and sexy, having a having a wind up.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal,\nproject manager: I think tha\nindustrial designer: but uh it's \nmarketing: It's about the practicality of it really, isn't it? You know?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. As against a watch, which constantly keeps moving,\nmarketing: I mean if \nindustrial designer: this this thing will have to be tapped every time, which which might be very frustrating for the user.\nproject manager: Depends how much how much movement it really needs.\nindustrial designer: Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that,\nproject manager: Pr presumably if they're suggesting it, then we could use it.\nindustrial designer: yeah, right. Okay, let's keep it option uh keep an option,\nproject manager: I'd I'd keep it on.\nindustrial designer: yeah. Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out, right? It has to be at least curved from one side, yeah.\nproject manager: We don't want that\nuser interface: Yeah\nproject manager: it's no it's not not vegetable.\nuser interface: it's yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um okay, we still have all all the options. Wood, do you think wood will be a good idea?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: you can't make it like thin and \nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: I can't imagine a m wooden remote control.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: The wood thing. Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in, so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky\nindustrial designer: Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break,\nuser interface: wi mm-mm yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: it's it's much more uh \nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences, I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: U yeah wood is not really yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Well it's not very cleanable either,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That's true.\nmarketing: do you know.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table, but for a remote control, you know.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: And splinters and stuff and \nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: okay wood is out.\nmarketing: It just m doesn't make any sense, I think is the thing with wood.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, in the case of remote control not really.\nindustrial designer: Okay, now for the really interesting stuff, the interface.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right, so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but uh it seems to be out of trend, you know, nobody seems to be \nmarketing: You have to have some push-buttons, don't you?\nuser interface: Yeah, but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them, wouldn't you?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm right.\nmarketing: G yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so for channel numbers but \nindustrial designer: Oh, if if we have L_C_D_ displays, that opens up a whole world, you know, if you have an L_C_D_ display, then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display.\nuser interface: But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah, it's faster\nproject manager: Just for fast \nuser interface: with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: but if you do want to use L_C_D_, then you flip it open,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but it's it it's more time-consuming.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven.\nindustrial designer: Mm right.\nproject manager: And it \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah L_ L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options. Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine? Or do we have just uh channel plus, channel minus, just to just to scroll?\nuser interface: No, no, I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers,\nindustrial designer: The numbers.\nuser interface: because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels. Um \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_?\nindustrial designer: Or on the L_C_D_ we can, you know \nmarketing: G yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah, I would say buttons,\nmarketing: I would think buttons, yeah.\nproject manager: Buttons.\nuser interface: because it's yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: It's it's the \nindustrial designer: So mm \nmarketing: I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use than any other remote,\nuser interface: I\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible,\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: but, you know, I mean most of the time \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_, I think is the the the issue there.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um \nproject manager: I think that's what you guys are gonna do next,\nindustrial designer: Uh okay.\nproject manager: so if we put down the key um things that we want.\nindustrial designer: Okay, okay, so the components.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right, so uh what about the the scrolling uh?\nuser interface: Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah, about the spinning wheel. So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing,\nmarketing: E either or \nuser interface: it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you\nmarketing: G yeah.\nproject manager: Just spinning and not scrolling, I would say.\nuser interface: yeah, yeah,\nmarketing: I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel,\nuser interface: in that case.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: so you have to decide whether you you know, you want to be going so fast or not. But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber, on the basis that it's spongy, then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm um \nproject manager: But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing, effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side, but you folded it in half.\nuser interface: Ah, but I mean you can {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side.\nproject manager: Th that would be on one side, uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber. Uh i it \nproject manager: No, I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside.\nuser interface: Yeah, I um I think so too, I mean the case would be \nmarketing: You want an outside of rubber\nuser interface: yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons,\nmarketing: and then open it up and \nindustrial designer: Or or at the corners, edges, just the edges covered by rubber or something like that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: rubber buttons, but then \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Or maybe like interchangeable cases.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel, but I have like a you know, obviously my iPod's not made of rubber, but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it\nindustrial designer: Right, right.\nmarketing: and I can change the colour, theoretically, to match my outfit.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: okay, so so that gives us a more trendy look as well. Um \nmarketing: Yeah, I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now.\nindustrial designer: Right. Yeah, and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: That's right,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: that's what they're after.\nindustrial designer: So I'll rub that out. And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such, you know, just keep it black, or \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company, so would it be like yellow, grey and black or something, or \nmarketing: That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though.\nproject manager: I guess.\nuser interface: Yeah, does \nproject manager: Bananas. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Banana's yellow, yeah, definitely.\nmarketing: Yeah, but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours, do you know? So you could have like \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple\nproject manager: Green. Yeah.\nmarketing: and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um okay, if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits. Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to \nproject manager: We need the advanced yeah.\nindustrial designer: um what we do need to consider, however, is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering, but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So I'll rub off the other two.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or \nproject manager: That was the \nindustrial designer: Oh is oh the constraint was uh \nmarketing: If \nproject manager: We can't have solar panels with rubber, so.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: solar panels with the rubber.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. So \nmarketing: Yeah, okay, so we lose that I think.\nproject manager: Shall we go for if we're going for rubber, we think uh on as our case, and then \nuser interface: Mm-hmm. And the buttons as well, I think. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We've got five more minutes.\nindustrial designer: we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one, I mean, a although it does seem uh interesting.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: It's just a gimmick.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Uh okay, so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback, right? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that, so \nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in,\nindustrial designer: Ye yeah, we we don't have too much information about it, um \nproject manager: but if it's Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company, yeah.\nproject manager: It's from the company, so \nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay, so so th this is in as well then, the sample speaker.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Okay. And the case is curved on one side, but then flat flat, so it's flipped into each other.\nindustrial designer: Flat on the top. Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer?\nmarketing: Yeah, sure j\nproject manager: Just so we can \nmarketing: Sorry, do you want me to \nproject manager: Nothing, it's right, I'm just There we go.\nmarketing: What does um I_C_S_ mean?\nindustrial designer: I_C_s? Uh integrated circuits.\nmarketing: Okay, cool. So it's advanced integrated circuits?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh oh now I've gone too far.\nindustrial designer: Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s, mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. We're on our way. Okay. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery, the advanced chip\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself, um made out of rubber\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: and the buttons are also rubber. We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel, and we're incorporating voice recognition. That's our overall concept,\nuser interface: Um \nproject manager: and it's gonna look sort of vegetable,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and be in bright vegetable colours.\nuser interface: Uh-huh. So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_, or would it be on the outer \nmarketing: Imagine it would be inside.\nproject manager: I think it's on the \nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: So um actually that could like really cut down your thing,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: so you've got your outside, which is like minimalist, and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel, which you can incorporate buttons into.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: You've maybe got, you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel,\nproject manager: On the Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel, and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel,\nproject manager: In the centre,\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: yeah, sure.\nuser interface: Mm yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting. In the meantime, the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: which I'll presume he'll work out what that means. Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation. And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Cool.\nproject manager: Is that all okay? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder, it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Cool, I'm gonna go and sit on my own.\nproject manager: Y ah nobody wants to talk to you.\nmarketing: I know, I'm hated.\nproject manager: Unplug yourself.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I've got a bit tangled up in all this {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with \nproject manager: I dunno, maybe I would car\nuser interface: we need to ", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumez toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "This meeting was about technical design. Firstly, the group had three presentations on remote components, user interface and market trends. They presented remote control features including the circuit board, the chip, the kinetic energy, the interface mechanism of operation, the scroll wheel to be added as well as the LCD and spinning innovation. Then, the group had a discussion about the key remote concepts. They decided to have a LCD display with a spinning wheel. They would not have hand dynamos, instead, they would have a wind dynamo. And they would keep the kinetic energy as an option and look at more spongy material preferences with rubber or plastic.", "zh_summary": "此次会议是关于技术设计的。首先，开发团队介绍了遥控器的组件、用户界面和市场趋势，其中，遥控器的组件包括电路板、芯片、动能、操作界面机制、转轮以及液晶显示器（LCD）和转轮创新。然后，开发团队就关键的遥控器概念进行了讨论。他们决定用一个带转轮的液晶显示器（LCD），且遥控器无需手动发电，只要通过风力就能发电。最后，他们还讨论了遥控器的动能，并将在未来寻找更多橡胶或塑料等柔性材料。", "fr_summary": "Cette réunion portait sur la conception technique.

{"fname": "product_dev_71", "dialogue": "project manager: Excellent. Alright. So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria, as a result of doing that?\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: Not really, no.\nmarketing: No, I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep L_C_D_ display.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway,\nindustrial designer: Um yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But we lose the locator.\nproject manager: Alright then.\nmarketing: Really?\nproject manager: We're gonna have a beep.\nuser interface: Well we're going to have a beeping thing.\nindustrial designer: So instead of speaker, .\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But yeah, it's it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep, so we still have the locate.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Cool.

{"fname": "product_dev_117", "dialogue": "project manager: So it's \nmarketing: My turn?\nproject manager: yeah, Marketing Expert.\nmarketing: Okay, it's alright.\nproject manager: Participant two?\nindustrial designer: Four.\nproject manager: Four,\nmarketing: Four, I think.\nproject manager: sorry.\nmarketing: Trend, yeah. No uh yes. Okay, so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control. So, next slide please. So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple. Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know, so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing, and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them, always, like a phone. We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired. Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends, they're inventing it, they're creating the trend. I hope I'm going to try to help you on that. This is more risky because you're not following the trend,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: you try to invent it, which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So anyway uh next slide please. Uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to. The first one, which seems to be the most important one, is that it has to be fancy, it has to have a fancy look and feel. And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing. It has to be fancy. Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically i innovative,\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important, which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control. So as you see uh it first have to be very nice, s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends, huh, mine has this and not yours. And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Next slide please.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing. If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan, well, it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: or so. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And I think of course uh i it applies to everything. That's the thing with trends. It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Fruit and vegetable. Think fruit and vegetable. And uh if we co we compare to last year, now it has to be spongy,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: What is spongy?\nmarketing: yeah. Well\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nmarketing: this so so I think uh uh i\nindustrial designer: kind of um maybe \nmarketing: When we were talking about rubber,\nindustrial designer: Yeah it \nmarketing: I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. We need to think about mm mm.\nmarketing: Seems not, seems not.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um sorry Mark.\nmarketing: So {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It seems to be \nmarketing: Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy,\nindustrial designer: Fruit. Even shape?\nmarketing: as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow. I mean \nindustrial designer: More \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Hmm. You're old-fashioned.\nmarketing: So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought\nproject manager: Sorry. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but that's that's fashion and {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay that's all I have to say.\nproject manager: Mm you have questions?\nindustrial designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people? Or it's \nmarketing: These I'm sorry.\nindustrial designer: This you you so did you \nmarketing: Yeah, yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world, of course,\nindustrial designer: Where? Oh. Oh, okay, mm-hmm.\nmarketing: as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends\nindustrial designer: It's not from mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: that are also \nindustrial designer: It's more general trend\nmarketing: well.\nindustrial designer: it's not particular to the remote control.\nmarketing: No, it's not it's not this this is very general, yeah. But it seems that trends travel across things.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Yeah.\nmarketing: The what we \nindustrial designer: Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy\nmarketing: Sure.\nindustrial designer: or \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah yeah.\nmarketing: We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables\nindustrial designer: yeah, yeah sponge, yeah yeah at least that's \nmarketing: but we still have to put our chips inside, so of course.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah\nmarketing: This is your problem.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: that yeah yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: This is not mine. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, looking yeah fruit. These things can be easily incorporated. We can have t colours or this shape\nmarketing: Yeah, I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material.\nindustrial designer: or at least \nmarketing: If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay?\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: No more question? Okay.\nmarketing: Yep. Thanks.\nindustrial designer: yeah, so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables,\nproject manager: So\nindustrial designer: that's \nproject manager: you say s\nindustrial designer: we want to follow general trend.\nmarketing: Spongy.\nproject manager: S\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: do we agree on that? Yeah. We have to.\nindustrial designer: So, do you think \nmarketing: No, we don't have to,\nuser interface: So we have to uh for \nproject manager: No. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but seems it's the trend.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yeah.\nmarketing: Again, as I said we can also try to make it, to create the trend.\nuser interface: yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So there's no Well, that's you t can try to convince us.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well, we can make it smell like fruit. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay. that's a good idea,\nproject manager: Okay, that's a good idea.\nindustrial designer: That's {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So titanium smell like fruit.\nmarketing: I {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So what about location and these things, people are really interesting on those features? Or they really like They more want these fancy features\nmarketing: Uh I think i\nindustrial designer: like \nmarketing: yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Feature Yeah.\nmarketing: because we have it\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and others don't.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: It's fancy. Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I I agree with uh this uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness. Do we take titanium smelling like fruit, or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh we will try to explore these two options\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: and \nmarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option.\nindustrial designer: yeah yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Could we make a titanium shape? I mean fruit-shaped.\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape \nuser interface: But Doub double-curved.\nindustrial designer: yeah it's it's\nmarketing: Mm. Seems to be .\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah that's a we're to look for \nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive\nuser interface: Okay, okay. In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body.\nindustrial designer: and d Hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-mm. Okay, so\nuser interface: Well, okay w we'll see.\nproject manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two.\nuser interface: Yeah\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Or or spongy an yeah. \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or \nuser interface: We'll see. We'll see.\nmarketing: If you have time.\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose. If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: but uh it cannot be both.\nuser interface: We'll see. I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: For creation.\nuser interface: I dunno uh yeah um\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: we'll look.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Even design. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You can paint it afterward .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, okay.\nmarketing: No problem. We have a very large department of paint.\nproject manager: Yeah, do don't worry, you you you speak with mm mm.\nmarketing: You will do it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Alright, alright.\nproject manager: Okay.

Let's see if this Yeah, if you meet the evaluation criterion.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oops.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Fudge.\nmarketing: Yeah. So, evaluation please. So. You made a very nice prototype, and um, I think, we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it, if it fulfils our what we want to do, and things like that. So mm Uh, next slide, please. As you know, before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control, it's very important to first verify if it makes sense, if we have a chance to sell it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh, so we need to evaluate it um, try to do it in a constative way, and as much as we can. To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven. One meaning that, ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion, whatever it is. And seven meaning, no it doesn't fulfil at all. And we're all l going to list all the criterion. I'm going to go to that next slide,\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven. And then we are just going to have an average, which will give us the value of our uh remote control. So, maybe we can have a look at the criteria?\nindustrial designer: Fancy.\nmarketing: So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important. Of course, this can be discussed, but let's let's see, so let's vote. So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Huh.\nmarketing: So,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, what's is really \nmarketing: what do you think, is it fancy? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh, it's really {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh, I think that fancy, we can say it is fancy. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It is very very fancy. Or have you ever seen something like that? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh. I am not the d the only one choosing, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, of course.\nproject manager: Uh what do you think?\nmarketing: What do you think?\nuser interface: Feel the weight.\nmarketing: Is it The weight is later.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Oh.\nuser interface: Really. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-huh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Now we're {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: We're on the fanciness now. I think it's quite fancy.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We can give at least five or six, seven.\nmarketing: It's uh Yeah, so No it's it's one.\nproject manager: It's in the other .\nindustrial designer: Oh, Oh. So Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Oh, okay. So \nmarketing: Yeah, o one means it's, yes, a very fancy and seven mean no at all.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So it's one or two.\nproject manager: Two. Let's say two, yeah.\nindustrial designer: M maybe two.\nmarketing: What do you think? Two?\nuser interface: Two. Two.\nmarketing: Okay. So here, two. Up.\nindustrial designer: Technology.\nmarketing: Then we have uh technology.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Um \nmarketing: So, what about technology? We have uh we have speech recognition, we have location based ,\nindustrial designer: And we have L_C_D_.\nmarketing: we have L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Change colour of t\nindustrial designer: So you change colours.\nmarketing: Change colour, I mean that's very \nindustrial designer: Useful.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think it's a \nmarketing: Quite\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: d I think it's a one for that, at least.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. It's silly.\nmarketing: At least a one, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Robustness, uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Uh, still we need to cha {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away.\nproject manager: Um \nmarketing: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again? Uh, maybe not the prototype.\nproject manager: The strawberries {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Let's try. Oh my god. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe strawberry.\nmarketing: Okay, we just lost one strawberry.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: So {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No. How can I say this.\nmarketing: Not at all?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we can easily plug it.\nuser interface: It's still it's still working, and your daughter got a bonus.\nmarketing: It is Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: A strawberry.\nmarketing: So it's not so bad.\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: I um uh I would say three.\nproject manager: Yeah. But it's too .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's um robust, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, that does make sense, yeah?\nindustrial designer: Useful?\nmarketing: Useful. Well, so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, \nmarketing: So I don't know. These buttons are uh It not clear.\nproject manager: Oh, yeah, lets me try.\nmarketing: But you have at least uh next produce.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: What is uh next, please?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, channel. I this is volume control and channel changes. These are the main \nmarketing: Uh, it depends on the \nproject manager: And you can uh do di two sites?\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: You \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option.\nproject manager: Okay, also.\nindustrial designer: So if you don't want \nmarketing: So but, for instance, because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control, touch screen, you cannot go to channel twenty five directly.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, um yeah.\nproject manager: You can, by using the \nuser interface: You can.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Directly.\nuser interface: You go you \nproject manager: You c push here the the \nuser interface: So, the basic mode \nproject manager: yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. So that's simple. The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: With two buttons, you do this like uh volume up, volume down.\nmarketing: Oh, it's a jog dial, okay.\nuser interface: Or if you go to the site, it's channel up channel down.\nindustrial designer: And channel.\nmarketing: Uh-huh. Okay.\nuser interface: And if you want to make to s twenty-five, you push on this.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: You select twenty, you select five.\nindustrial designer: You can select.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: That's it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah mm.\nmarketing: It's much longer than that that being two two five, no?\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: Don't you think so? May not okay, we can go. That's uh You're right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah.\nmarketing: That's it's less uh Yeah. But it's it's nice, because people anyway don't go there.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. Yeah mm.\nmarketing: But So what do you think for it, usefulness?\nindustrial designer: So, d Yeah, we need to address we want \nmarketing: Seems to be useful. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_. So\nproject manager: Let me understand well,\nindustrial designer: so \nproject manager: because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button.\nmarketing: Both. Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Up.\nmarketing: Up down or left right. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. And which what is that?\nuser interface: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: This is jog wheel.\nmarketing: That \nproject manager: Okay, okay. It's a kind Oh, okay okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Like, selecting the menus.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Um, see in L_C_D_, like you will have blocks and you select which one.\nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Oh oh okay, great.\nmarketing: I would say then uh \nproject manager: Now it's looks us useful.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: Two or three?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Two or three?\nindustrial designer: Two, maybe. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Two.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, two. So size and weight.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. \nmarketing: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size, real weight? Or Because it \nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's size al almost \nmarketing: Size is going to be that, yeah?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, because it is \nmarketing: Uh, and and \nindustrial designer: The weight will be bit lighter. We will s We use titanium.\nuser interface: Sure,\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nuser interface: without titanium alloy, it's going to be light.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: It's going to be lighter,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Of course.\nmarketing: because this seems to be very heavy f I mean,\nindustrial designer: Heavy. Yeah.\nmarketing: for my daughter, for instance.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Not sure if uh she can use it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But sides uh, the sides should be okay. . Yeah\nmarketing: So, should be okay.\nindustrial designer: mm.\nmarketing: Up to three for that,\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nmarketing: because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh \nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: Colour and shape.\nproject manager: Uh-oh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, so colour, it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: But um, it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The case is silver titanium, no?\nmarketing: It's a it's going to be titanium. Okay, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's .\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That's nice.\nproject manager: Let's imagine.\nmarketing: I think it's good. Okay.\nproject manager: And what about the strawberries on the top? I'm not convince. But maybe I'm not trendy. But, uh \nmarketing: Yahoo. Well y you know, it's this uh fruit and vegetable year.\nindustrial designer: Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but uh uh they're not useful.\nmarketing: So {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I I mean it that's uh \nindustrial designer: So maybe, I think \nmarketing: Uh, I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, well \nmarketing: Whether it's fancy or not now, it we have to decide.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Um \nmarketing: But this\nproject manager: I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful.\nmarketing: If it's Uh-huh. So, that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, well then it's bit difficult to use. Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction, too.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. But the n Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So, maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff for strawberries and different colours.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: So it's \nmarketing: So, it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh \nindustrial designer: Even \nproject manager: No, I'm not sure uh why \nindustrial designer: These buttons \nproject manager: uh if it was like this \nindustrial designer: But it looks really not really good.\nproject manager: I It's n no, it's not fancy any more.\nindustrial designer: I mean, the f Yeah. So these are kind of rubber things. Even if you lose one you can just put whatever.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: And \nindustrial designer: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits, and \nproject manager: Uh-huh. And different routes. Okay, I see what \nuser interface: Moreover, moreover it covers it covers all the end goals. Even if it is, you know, it's very rounded,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: but still you got some rubber fruit here, and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here,\nproject manager: Also.\nindustrial designer: so we just Yeah, so even if you don't put, it works. But this is really fancy. \nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: I suggested three.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Because uh, everybody s doesn't seem to be convince,\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: although it's quite \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: You have good arguments.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: But \nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And uh the last one is adaptive. This is not r maybe not as important as the other one, {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use?\nuser interface: Sure, sure, just look at it. It's full adaptable. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Great.\nproject manager: Wow, that's a {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Fully adaptable.\nuser interface: Yeah, you can fit it into your palm, you know.\nmarketing: That's Yeah.

You know.\nmarketing: It's fudge, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Right, yeah. And uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm, \nmarketing: Yeah, fruit titanium, yeah. Well, I if if this is if you are ready to do that, then I think it deserves a one. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.

Yeah.\nuser interface: Children proof.\nmarketing: Ye ye yeah.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: So she likes uh buttons which make click,\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, pret\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so it has to click.\nproject manager: So they have to be waterproof maybe?\nmarketing: It has to be uh wha baby proof {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'Cause they eat she ate it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: yeah but mainly it has to be very robust\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Ah.\nmarketing: So it has to be very robust.\nuser interface: Okay, unbreakable.\nmarketing: Unbreakable, yeah.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we have some child lock or something, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: And uh it has to be nice looking,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: colourful, maybe \nproject manager: Colourful, yeah mm.\nuser interface: Colourful? That's not practical.\nmarketing: colourful, because uh nobody has colourful remote control\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: No, that's a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's always black or yeah.\nmarketing:, they're always black, yeah,\nproject manager: Mm mm-mm.\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: but this one could be I dunno, purple or b\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But how gonna okay, just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: No,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: because you think, why not.\nuser interface: Otherwise you will never find it.\nmarketing: One colour.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah even we can change colours, no? Like the uh\nmarketing: Oh like the phones,\nindustrial designer: like the phones and these things we c yeah.\nmarketing: yeah, it could change colours, yeah.\nuser interface: Cool.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: At least for children like one colour and . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Ch\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good idea.\nmarketing: Good.\nindustrial designer: And it should be really small and .\nproject manager: Small also? Don't you think \nindustrial designer: Huh not so big like yeah.\nproject manager: No uh, not too much buttons or mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, not too much buttons and \nmarketing: Should it be, y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television, then it's the remote control for the the sound system, or for your refrigerator\nindustrial designer: Uh. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: whatever {vocalsound}\nproject manager: that's \nmarketing: I dunno if it's \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Or if we should have a targeted re remote control.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: So colour, robustness, easy to use, size,\nproject manager: So, I think there's \nmarketing: yeah, size matters, yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Colour, size, sh\nproject manager: So you you think it's better if small than bigger.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah, but without any extremes like n not of this size, not too large. Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No, not too small, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, at least it should hold in your hand n properly, like .\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, like a palm sized.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Just to hold it.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: But uh what would be different from this, from the others? I dunno if \nindustrial designer: Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. Mm. S so then it depends \nmarketing: Yeah, at least the colour would be different.\nindustrial designer: you are to \nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame .\nmarketing: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow,\nproject manager: Mm. So, some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what \nmarketing: I dunno .\nuser interface: No,\nproject manager: no.\nuser interface: no screens, it's too complex.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Too expensive, yeah.\nmarketing: Too expensive for twelve Euro?\nuser interface: And n maybe not too expensive,\nproject manager: And too expensive.\nuser interface: well it's not my problem, but well okay.\nmarketing: Ah.\nuser interface: But no screens on remote controls.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right,\nindustrial designer: Ye yeah.\nmarketing: so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control,\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: if you if you like.\nindustrial designer: I mean it it's like\nmarketing: I don't know if it makes sense, but \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: it's like two types no? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this, say if you're right handed you use like this\nmarketing: Yeah, for instance, mm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm.\nindustrial designer: or so tha your switch on and off should be on\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: So adaptable yeah something \nuser interface: Adaptable. Alright, good,\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nmarketing: Maybe, if if it's possible, yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so how many actions do we need to implement in it?\nindustrial designer: huh.\nuser interface: On off?\nindustrial designer: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We can adapt only one switch, suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations.\nuser interface: I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: Three buttons you mean?\nuser interface: like three mental states,\nproject manager: Three option.\nuser interface: yeah you know what I mean,\nmarketing: Ah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: we can just make it uh\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Um.\nuser interface: controlled by a brain, huh? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm, yeah, sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe if it's more, if there is a software inside\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: that ask you three \nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: \nproject manager: If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button, three mm possibilities, ye yeah.\nuser interface: Sh sure, sure.\nmarketing: Yeah, more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time.\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, and nothing else.\nmarketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You do this?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh no.\nuser interface: I usually just change channels.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Because I'm only using three or four channels but {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit.\nproject manager: Yeah. I change channel like this, m uh I want to go to twenty five, and then to ten, uh-huh mm yeah.\nindustrial designer: Dash.\nmarketing: And then back to the one I was before,\nproject manager: Also we can be here \nmarketing: so there's whichever it was.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you can\nproject manager: yeah, that would be cool.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: Go back button is good.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Uh uh we had that in in other countries.\nuser interface: I once had it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, the previous button is .\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh, okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: History. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh uh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions,\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: that becomes more complex,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, what the which channels the viewer {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nmarketing: Yeah {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: maybe it's a \nproject manager: So I think we have full of idea.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones, make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want.

So \nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our uh remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room. And mostly they are smaller. So \nindustrial designer: Yes. But that won't be a problem. I think.\nproject manager: Most the times that are not advanced televisions.\nindustrial designer: No, but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And I think, what I said, everybody has them uh has them already.

{"fname": "product_dev_107", "dialogue": "project manager: So welcome. The first kick-off meeting. What shall we do? First the opening, then the rest. What are we going to do. We m have to make a new remote control.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly. So we will get back th on that. First we have to make a functional design. After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design. So we'll discuss that later. First we have a look at . So first to we have to make a small painting. What have do we have to do. First you can save the documents. We have to do that every time we make something. You can print it. No. And we have to use the pen and the eraser. So Now. We all have to use this one.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You have to make your own favourite animal.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So I'll make an example.\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: First don't touch that things.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You can use the pen. And then you can make um something.\nindustrial designer: Nice.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um you can change some things.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um format, line, and change it.  And you can change the colour.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: An elephant. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So that's it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So So and after it you have to save it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Now we can make a new one.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: You have to paint now. So you're next.\nmarketing: Oh. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Well we will try. Where it going?\nindustrial designer: .\nuser interface: Hmm. That's uh strange. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: .\nproject manager: What is going on?\nindustrial designer: pop-ups.\nproject manager: What are you What?\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: What is this, Pictionary.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: Um \nindustrial designer: Uh a bird.\nproject manager: Is a It is a It is a \nindustrial designer: Bird.\nproject manager: A duck.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So Now save?\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nmarketing: Now uh blank?\nproject manager: Blank, yes.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay next one. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay. Let's try this. Uh \nindustrial designer: Whoo.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Um. Mm-hmm. Mm.\nproject manager: Oh. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh not. Oh. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay. Okay. Yeah. No problem.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Shit happens. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now. Okay.\nindustrial designer: A parrot. Ish.\nmarketing: Wow. Oh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: He did it before.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, no. Yeah. Okay.\nmarketing: Nice.\nproject manager: Very good.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nuser interface: Uh blank.\nindustrial designer: Thank you.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Very good. So um you can always go back. So \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's it. So that was two. Now next. The budget. The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros. And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it. So now we have to think about what we will make. First I wanna hear from you. Uh what are your experiences with remote controls. So \nindustrial designer: Uh I will start.\nproject manager: F first .\nindustrial designer: Uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Big one, they are uh not easy to use. Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke. So that won't be uh our goal, I think.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think. Not all the small buttons, you don't know \nproject manager: Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?\nindustrial designer: Big buttons, positive.\nproject manager: Positive.\nindustrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.\nproject manager: Okay. What are your experiences?\nuser interface: Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: And that it controls the channels and the the volume. And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote. So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it. And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working. And uh yeah. Uh \nproject manager: So and do they always have that?\nuser interface: Yeah, but No no no. But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.\nproject manager: It's easy to you.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. 'Kay.\nmarketing: Uh at home we have a T_V_, a video uh recorder, a D_V_D_ player, and a satellite receiver. We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.\nindustrial designer: Thank you.\nmarketing: That's not really ea easy.\nindustrial designer: Help also. Thank you.\nmarketing: So it would be nice if we have one for all. And we also had a remote control for our radio set. But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what. And it was uh uh v not easy to use. So we n barely used it.\nproject manager: Okay so they have too much. So next.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it. So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control? What what does it have to have? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The weight. Not not too heavy.\nproject manager: Not too heavy. Yes.\nindustrial designer: Not much buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Bust-free. That when you drop it, it won't break. Like uh some kind of rubber on it. Or hard uh hard plastic. Uh buttons not too small. Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen. Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_, then you hear some  uh some sort of bleep.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Like a phone.\nindustrial designer: And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So,\nindustrial designer: Next.\nproject manager: that's .\nuser interface: Yeah well that's that are good ideas. Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working. If you push a button. Um Yeah. And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material. So probably plastic or something. Uh \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice. Or you won't sell it.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have. And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.\nproject manager: Okay. This is It has to be compatible with other things.\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: I have one more idea. Just popped up.\nproject manager: Yes?\nindustrial designer: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries. So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.\nproject manager: No battery use. So more ideas?\nuser interface: Mm no.\nproject manager: No okay. It's only the first ideas. So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour. Uh Okay. Next meeting, half an hour. Um, what you have to do. Well look on your . And Next instructions you'll get in your email. So This is the first meeting. See you later in half an hour.\nuser interface: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Okay.

We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore. So not necessary.\nproject manager: So what controls do we need? Who first?\nuser interface: Well a power button?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Uh power.\nuser interface: Uh the well um I think separate channels. So \nproject manager: Uh mm channel.\nuser interface: But then both the the separate channels.

That was the the the the the \nuser interface: Technical.\nproject manager: technical Hallo. Okay. What do we need? On-off. Zero to nine.\nindustrial designer: To change to the next channel, just one button. To move up, move down.\nproject manager: Yeah that's the channel.\nmarketing: D Yeah. Do we make a menu?\nproject manager: Menu? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus. Uh \nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager:  M Menu. I think um the only one or two numbers.\nuser interface: Mm yes.\nproject manager: And Hello? That's ch {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think it will be um q quite easy to use, to have uh uh four arrows.

And if you press the menu button you get into the menu, and you can use the same buttons. But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options.\nproject manager: On the L_C_D_ screen, you mean?\nmarketing: Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_. Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control.\nproject manager: Think it's better to have it on the remote control, 'cause it it has to work on all televisions. So\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: we need \nindustrial designer: But then we come to the costs.\nproject manager: N Yes. But if we have this \nmarketing: 'Kay. But well if you aim at the younger market, um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab, uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control.

Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting, we'll have to hurry up.\nmarketing: I'm listening.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Um well I'll start with the presentation again, the agenda.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Great.\nproject manager: Yo. So. Uh This one I think.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh yeah. Well alright. Um well, I'll show you the notes. It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but I'll show them. We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design. Um Then we'll have to dec decide about the control, the remote control concepts. I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder, which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: So this time we exactly know what to decide about.\nmarketing: Alright, great.\nproject manager: And then we'll close again.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: Uh Well these are some examples, but we'll talk about them later. We'll first look at your uh presentations. Alright?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Walter will uh start again this time?\nmarketing: Yeah, great.\nproject manager: Yo.\nmarketing: Alright, Trendwatch.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. I will speak about uh latest trends trends, latest fashion updates, and uh things we must not do.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Uh the trends. It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling. Uh this because of our last model was very functional, but it uh people didn't like that, so our new mo model must be very good-looking. That's uh something you uh have to take a look at.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Alright.\nmarketing: And uh the feeling has to be very great. Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Um there's a minus uh two times here, because this is the most important point. This is uh two times as less important,\nproject manager: Less. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and uh same for this one. Um, technological technological innovations, that's uh regarded very highly too.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen, uh speech uh acknowledgement, as we uh talked about earlier.\nproject manager: Well, yeah.\nmarketing: So we have to have uh something like that, like we uh \nproject manager: L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts.\nmarketing: Right. Uh the last point is easy to use. Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself. I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that.\nindustrial designer: Easy to use?\nproject manager: Well, easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh \nmarketing: Yeah?\nindustrial designer: I think that's your ta\nuser interface: \nproject manager: Functional is not an issue, and then easy to use.\nmarketing: Yeah, I know.\nproject manager: Well we have to choose one of them. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think we have to go for the first one.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: It's the most important one. So we have to uh take that one.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy.\nuser interface: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But it has to look great.\nproject manager: Yeah. We'll we'll look at uh .\nindustrial designer: You Yeah. Yeah, yeah,\nmarketing: We'll see. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway, so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device.\nmarketing: Yeah, right. But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow, that's real great uh great concept.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Alright. Uh these are the new colours of this year.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So it must be very bright, very colourful.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: People like this.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So we we have to think uh in this direction.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: So i set your mind to it.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well \nmarketing: Findings? Fashion update? Fruit and vegetables are cool.\nindustrial designer: Uh you think?\nmarketing: I am told. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, well \nuser interface: Bananas.\nmarketing: Uh furthermore uh material, that's your part, should be very strong. I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: maybe in a colour or something,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: B\nmarketing: And that's uh also for the younger public.\nproject manager: Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year. Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's great.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily.\nproject manager: Yep, alright.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Well, the don'ts. Older people like dark colours and simple shapes. Well we don't want uh older people,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we want young people.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: So uh we're gonna turn that around.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours. Right?\nproject manager: Wood is popular. Aha.\nmarketing: Okay. We don't want wood.\nproject manager: Yeah yeah yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, among the old people, yeah.\nmarketing: Old people. So, that's it for me.\nproject manager: Alright. Nice, uh well show us.\nindustrial designer: Right, I am going to tell you something about the components design. Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties. This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device. And the materials? Um I have heard several things, so I uh I'll have to change that on the way. But uh the case? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic. But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong.\nmarketing: Yeah, we should change that.\nindustrial designer: It should feel strong. So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient.\nproject manager: Well maybe it it it is,\nindustrial designer: We should move to uh something \nproject manager: but it doesn't look strong. So maybe \nindustrial designer: Well yeah. Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough, but it doesn't have a really really tough look. So \nmarketing: No no no.\nproject manager: But we still have to look at our price of course. Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Also Yeah. Mm-hmm. But we'll return to that.\nproject manager: Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Uh the buttons of course rubber, I think everyone agrees. And electrical cables, copper is all pretty basic stuff. The chips made of silicon, I guess. I think that's the best uh way to do it.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Then I've uh had a few findings, made a few findings. Uh the target audience product style. Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like, as you said, uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that. They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style. But of course that's not our uh things this. So this is things we must not do.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people, which is of course our uh group, the people we aim at. Um under forty five years old. Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours. Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said, that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking.\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But they like soft materials, uh so we might uh we have to consider that. And also they like curved round shapes. So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want. And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here, that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices, gaming devices, should define the characteristics of the device. But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device, so we don't really have to consider that.\nproject manager: Sports uh, they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh\nuser interface: Soccer fronts. Mm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Huh? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: That's nice. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: All the results?\nindustrial designer: Well I also have um several examples of uh styles,\nmarketing: We keep coming back to the fronts. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It was not very uh interesting uh, very classical looking,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Nai. Uh no.\nindustrial designer: but that's n that's not what we want.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: We have these kind of things. I don't know what exactly they are.\nmarketing: Fruity. Fruity.\nindustrial designer: It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it's very primary colours, uh bright colours and uh round shapes.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You also uh see uh this device, it's not very round and Fruity of course. Yeah, it uh \nproject manager: It's t terrible.\nindustrial designer: That's true.\nproject manager: Alright.\nindustrial designer: And uh well round shapes, primary colours.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You can see it all here. And of course uh this famous device.\nproject manager: Hmm?\nindustrial designer: I think as you know something uh some devices like this.\nproject manager: Yeah, alright.\nindustrial designer: So to give you an idea of uh \nmarketing: Well it's got a strong look, this. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: This has a strong look. Although it's plastic, it's it's grey to to to give it iron look.\nmarketing: Yeah, it still has a strong look.\nproject manager: Yeah. And it's round.\nindustrial designer: That's uh \nmarketing: But then you are losing your fruity colours.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Well we have to make a \nproject manager: Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour. So uh those kind of things you can you can combine.\nmarketing: That's true.\nindustrial designer: Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control. I don't think that's very practical,\nproject manager: No, it isn't.\nindustrial designer: but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking, it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: 'Cause if you look at this, it it doesn't look very very strong,\nmarketing: Yeah but the \nindustrial designer: becau But this is plastic, and and this too, but \nmarketing: But it doesn't have to look strong. The the results are, the feel of the material is expected to be strongy.\nindustrial designer: The feel? Uh alright.\nmarketing: The feel.\nproject manager: So, if you ti\nindustrial designer: Well \nuser interface: And it it doesn't have to be strong, also.\nproject manager: Well \nmarketing: Nah yeah the feel \nproject manager: You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something.\nuser interface: Only the feel. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it it looks pretty but it feels strong.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Oh.\nindustrial designer: And I Then I have some more findings. Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device,\nmarketing: I agree.\nindustrial designer: uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery. I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course. But solar energy is not very practical inside a house, because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical, I think, for uh for a simple remote,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: that's a bit, oh, that's a bit uh That's a bit uh much.\nproject manager: No titanium. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium. That that's the information I received. If you use the curved case, uh a curved case, double curved then you can't use titanium.\nproject manager: What do you exactly mean with double curved?\nindustrial designer: Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look.\nuser interface: \nindustrial designer: And uh now the the shape, yeah, a curved case. Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something. Uh a more modern look not plain, long box style, but \nmarketing: I dunno.\nproject manager: Double curved?\nindustrial designer: I'll draw it,\nproject manager: It it mean \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, well okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but maybe later.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape, than if you have uh . Um anyway \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um f as uh for the buttons, simple push buttons. No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that, because it makes more complex and expensive. And, uh as we agreed, we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device.\nmarketing: Yeah right. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Because it makes it also more complex and expensive. But we do use an L_C_D_ screen, so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip, which is more complex and expensive. But It's worth the trouble I think,\nproject manager: Well \nuser interface: The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material.\nindustrial designer: because \nuser interface: Because people like that.\nproject manager: This soft material thing from uh Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh rubber is a soft material, I guess.\nuser interface: Yeah. Right. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh soft enough.\nmarketing: Yeah. Right.\nindustrial designer: So that's uh basically what I want to talk about.\nproject manager: Alright. Okay. We will take that. And then uh Mike? Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier. Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented. Um we must decide where, this meeting.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems, um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines. And um well they're cheap, so we could use them now.\nproject manager: Oh That's interesting.\nuser interface: Um it's not really speech recognition, it's more um like you can um talk to the chip, uh record the message and record an answer, and then once you uh talk to the remote, then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. So if I say hi Mike, and you have recorded uh hi Mike back, then you will get that.\nindustrial designer: Oh, yeah, I understand. Yeah.\nmarketing: Oh okay. \nproject manager: Okay. But you can also say that, when you say something, it does some function.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: No it doesn't does not do anything.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Oh. That's a bit uh \nuser interface: But i it's just a \nmarketing: But that that makes it cheap.\nproject manager: Yes. I understand.\nuser interface: Yeah it's it's cheap.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's it's just a an extra function,\nproject manager: But it has no functionality for our remote at all.\nmarketing: and it's cheap.\nuser interface: No\nmarketing: No but \nuser interface: but that's the gadget they want, or the gimmicks.\nmarketing: Yeah, right. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it it's n nice for young people.\nmarketing: Young people love them.\nuser interface: Yes, we we should really uh include that one, I think. Um \nindustrial designer: They like gadgets. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, ple Right.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: If it's cheap. Yeah.\nuser interface: Well, as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen, uh instead of uh extra buttons.\nproject manager: So you put a menu in the L_C_D_?\nuser interface: I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that. Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a, well, conventional remote, I think. For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable. A voice recognition can be uh implemented. And uh I drew an example,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do.\nmarketing: Alright.\nindustrial designer: Can you draw it now of uh \nmarketing: How How \nproject manager: Ah.\nuser interface: Hmm? Well I have the I can draw it again,\nindustrial designer: Can you draw it now?\nuser interface: and I know what I did wrong. I didn't tick the note bo box in the . Um \nindustrial designer: Mm. Alright.\nmarketing: How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen?\nuser interface: Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the \nmarketing: Alright. So you have a menu button, and then you can go up and down.\nproject manager: But then we should also have an uh an Okay button.\nuser interface: Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen. Yes.\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: Um I shall draw this. If it uh works.\nindustrial designer: button, yeah.\nproject manager: Just uh There is already a blank. Yes? So Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm so have I.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Nah.\nmarketing: . You have to push hard.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I suggest a banana shape.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Because of the fruity uh fashion.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: No m Next year that's out.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yellow and {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah alright, yeah. Just a hunch. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course?\nuser interface: Yeah just uh the numbers. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And then below is the L_C_D_ screen?\nuser interface: These these will be bigger in the the real design.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Alright, yeah.\nuser interface: This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: And with this you can uh, yes, go to through the menus\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button,\nmarketing: You've \nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: because you want it to uh t, yeah, to use it fast within one uh click.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: And what's the menu button?\nuser interface: Um it's {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And you you need a you need a speaker.\nuser interface: Hmm?\nmarketing: For the \nuser interface: This button can also be the Menu button, we use in the menus \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But how did How do you get out of the menu then? Yeah.\nuser interface: Well we we can add another button here, but \nproject manager: Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay. Uh \nindustrial designer: Uh by pe pressing the menu button again. By pressing the menu button again, you go uh out.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works.\nproject manager: Yes, well but bec because when you push Menu you get in,\nindustrial designer: Yeah? Yeah?\nproject manager: and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice.\nuser interface: Ah right. Well you you \nindustrial designer: Yeah. But you can men you can press menu again to get out.\nproject manager: Well that's also the Okay button. That's you you should have uh \nuser interface: No no, we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button\nindustrial designer: No.\nproject manager: Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out.\nuser interface: and this the Okay button.\nmarketing: Exit.\nproject manager: Exit .\nuser interface: Ah once you have an extra Menu button, you don't need that that extra option.\nproject manager: Well, it's just a choice.\nuser interface: You have uh redundancy.\nmarketing: But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Or don't \nuser interface: if we decide to uh to implement that, maybe we should.\nindustrial designer: Why would you put it uh then, and where is the recording uh the microphone?\nuser interface: Well they that could be anywhere.\nindustrial designer: Where would you put it?\nuser interface: That's very small. It could be uh down here. Um. Well, not here.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: I yeah I suggest here. But that's just a little gap. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Microphone, yeah.\nmarketing: Right, and spea speaker at the back, or something.\nuser interface: Well the speaker and the microphone, I think, are the same uh little hole thingy.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I understand.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Alright.\nindustrial designer: Uh but uh we could uh d do, but it's perhaps more expensive, uh the speaker on the back or something.\nuser interface: Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines, so they won't be uh very expensive. But \nproject manager: Huh?\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: Yeah? Okay.\nuser interface: This is my suggested design.\nproject manager: Well, okay, alright. Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make.\nuser interface: Um Yes. And oh I think as you can see so, the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end, or at the bottom.\nproject manager: I'd I agree.\nuser interface: But {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, fine. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Fine. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well yeah yeah yeah.\nmarketing: Move on. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Oh, um I had some uh examples.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I can live with it.\nproject manager: Yes?\nuser interface: You can uh But I did not like it very much, but \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well these are quite obvious, very ugly remote. Um \nproject manager: Too big. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: They do they don't look fruity enough.\nuser interface: No, well th\nmarketing: Nei They're n they're not trendy.\nproject manager: They're all black.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well not all. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Hey, that one I like. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh this is for children but th\nindustrial designer: Tho Yeah those \nmarketing: It doesn't look strong. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: But it doesn't uh the \nproject manager: The remote. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, ok Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: Well this is a terrible \nproject manager: Terrible.\nmarketing: This is just crazy.\nindustrial designer: But it it must not look too childish of course huh?\nproject manager: It's it's all too much buttons.\nuser interface: Um this looks \nproject manager: Too many buttons. That's \nuser interface: Yeah. This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens. I think we should, if it's um possible, uh one with colours, but \nmarketing: Nah th It's too expensive.\nuser interface: I don't know uh \nproject manager: Well, that's too expensive I think.\nuser interface: Too expensive? Alright.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Alright. Yeah.\nuser interface: Well Nah.\nindustrial designer: But it Yeah. \nproject manager: Okay. Huh.\nuser interface: Ha, even more. N\nproject manager: Mm no. 'Kay.\nmarketing: But are we going for a strange uh form?\nproject manager: No, not very strange.\nmarketing: 'Cause people like that.\nindustrial designer: Not not too strange. No.\nmarketing: Not too strange.\nproject manager: It still has t\nmarketing: You can make the the underside, you can make it more round, where the L_C_D_ is.\nproject manager: Yes. Th a a kind of bridge. So it f falls over the hand.\nuser interface: Well \nmarketing: I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone, with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms, s something like that.\nproject manager: Yeah? Yeah? Yeah.\nmarketing: You know? \nproject manager: Well I have at home a remote with a bridge. It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand, and that's very nice. That's It feels comfortable.\nmarketing: Yeah, but people like something uh new you know.\nindustrial designer: Exotic yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, different.\nindustrial designer: We have t Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I will design it, we design it later.\nmarketing: Y yis\nindustrial designer: So we'll get to that later I guess.\nmarketing: Alright. Great.\nproject manager: Yeah, alright. Um where did I put it? Um conceptual phase, I think this is it.\nindustrial designer: The specific shape. The \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I got this from our friends.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So Uh yeah the conceptual design.\nindustrial designer: Our sources.\nproject manager: These are a few examples which we have to decide about. All the the materials from the case, uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story. Um \nmarketing: Your bag. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Um now from the user interface, your uh package? Um where No well, that's more like the buttons where they have to come. And um B a bit of, yeah well, a bit of uh design.\nuser interface: Yeah, this is what we've just done. Right?\nproject manager: Yes, but we have to decide about these now.\nindustrial designer: But uh we should decide now.\nuser interface: Ah right.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And uh the trend-watching.\nmarketing: Materials are the most, most impor\nproject manager: So as you said, fruity is in, well sells good.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Wow.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh these things.\nindustrial designer: So we have to uh put it in one uh document. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh yes. Um so if we uh go through them \nindustrial designer: Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document, and then uh put the answers after the subjects. Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Not everything.\nindustrial designer: Well we have to decide all these things?\nuser interface: Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine.\nproject manager: Yeah well uh Why should I uh \nindustrial designer: W we can uh override them?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Well a case? Uh that's me. Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What what kind of properties should it have? Well we just listened.\nindustrial designer: Uh s solid,\nuser interface: I think we {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard, yeah, some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front.\nmarketing: Do you know the new uh \nuser interface: That Just like um most cell phones are.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I understand.\nmarketing: No no {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. So we have titanium. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The front is the most important.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: to give that uh strong look.\nproject manager: You know what?\nindustrial designer: And then the front is made of plastic. And you can put that on and off, and switch it.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But the feel of plastic isn't strong. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No but you have titanium of course.\nuser interface: No but you you have this Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh you have the best of both worlds.\nmarketing: Yeah alright, alright. 'Kay.\nuser interface: Yeah, you have the re remote in your hand like this. So you feel titanium. \nindustrial designer: And of course, yeah, you have the the the plastic front end. But you also have the titanium.\nmarketing: Yeah. Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah of course, but yeah you have to make a decision.\nuser interface: And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to.\nmarketing: Yeah, but it it's expensive.\nindustrial designer: I guess so.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh titanium I sh I think uh \nmarketing: Bendable.\nindustrial designer: Huh? Well, well the \nmarketing: Bendable.\nuser interface: Well any colour \nindustrial designer: According to my sources, uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available, and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it, if we want.\nuser interface: Yeah, then you you paint it in the colour you want it. The plastic is is the colour you want it.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah. Paint spray.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah alright.\nuser interface: So  Yeah.\nproject manager: Alright.\nmarketing: So, we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front?\nproject manager: I've uh \nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: Titanium back, plastic front.\nindustrial designer: I think that's a nice trade-off.\nproject manager: Okay. Um well I am going to put it in here, uh because we can uh look.\nmarketing: Yeah, great.\nproject manager: I Um solid feel and trendy look.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: So material, um hard plastic for the front?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, for the front and then titanium for the back.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: For the non-removable uh part.\nmarketing: But then you have the problem, when you have a titanium back, you can't switch it. When you want an other colour on the front, it doesn't match.\nuser interface: Well titanium is neutral. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well but {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You know?\nindustrial designer: The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah, i it doesn't uh curves.\nmarketing: I understand.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No uh I nei. Titanium is very No no no, but you know b Titanium is very basic colour,\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I dunno if if you disagree,\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Well \nindustrial designer: but I think it's doesn't matter very much.\nuser interface: Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours,\nmarketing: Yeah. Alright.\nuser interface: and they don't use uh wood.\nmarketing: Funky customers.\nindustrial designer: And even if it does uh doesn't match, it will uh People like mm colours that don't match.\nuser interface: Mm. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. And well\nmarketing: Alright. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: the the electrical cable is just normal uh . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Cop copper uh material.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Excuse me?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The electrical cable uh does \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's uh from uh our coffee uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh \nuser interface: No we don't use an electrical cable.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Yeah inside, but this is for the coffee uh machine.\nindustrial designer: Yeah in \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh \nproject manager: Of course.\nuser interface: Yeah, but that's not what's meant here, I think. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nei.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: So external.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh external?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja. Never mind the coffee grind.\nproject manager: Well uh\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work. So {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The chip is normal silicon.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh the buttons are normal, etcetera.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay? So that's just easy.\nindustrial designer: Alright. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes. The conceptual specification of the user interface? Um well we have our beautiful drawing.\nuser interface: Well I got a better one here\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: and I will um \nproject manager: Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder,\nuser interface: The shared folder.\nproject manager: and then I'll put it in our end report.\nuser interface: I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting.\nproject manager: Yes, you can Mm yeah. You can uh put some uh which button is what.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. Um\nuser interface: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: the trend-watching  included these days. And what do we?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We thing that fruit and bright colours are \nindustrial designer: Yeah the the the front w\nmarketing: I think we can launch a couple of packages. You can buy a different kind of of of machine,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: but it's the same thing, but with another front.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot.\nmarketing: So \nuser interface: Yeah that's the whole idea of the front.\nmarketing: And you can you can \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: Uh those kind of things.\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: But that's for later on. The fronts y you can do anything with them.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini \nuser interface: Yeah, right For the uh initiative uh launch.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: For the for the launch, yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: It's good marketing.\nproject manager: Launch different lines at once.\nindustrial designer: So e th then a c couple of basic colours. Not not very uh sim Not {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, n not too heavy. You can always take another pick. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time.\nmarketing: They have to buy it later on.\nuser interface: Oh yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Come on. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: More basic.\nproject manager: We still have to make those fifty million, yeah?.\nindustrial designer: Very boring, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so,\nindustrial designer: The most boring fronts possible.\nproject manager: The most ugly.\nuser interface: so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more.\nmarketing: Yeah, right.\nproject manager: Two.\nindustrial designer: Yeah but you you can have some basic colours, and then we come with the special patterns on them,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Red red, blue and green you give them or something,\nindustrial designer: and and uh \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: and then you can give them uh other ones.\nindustrial designer: And uh \nproject manager: Yeah. Alright. Um well the buttons etcetera, we get from Mike. Uh this fruit and bright colours, yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour, we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch, when we uh well introduce our remote.\nindustrial designer: Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design. Because yeah we have the sketch but \nmarketing: Yeah. But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: Else it w won't sell.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Alright, yeah.\nproject manager: Well I'll have to, before I get another warning for five minutes, I'm going to get Where is my mouse? Uh where is my mouse? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Lost my mouse. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um this is it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Unbelievable. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well, um this we have.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh basic stuff. Interface we have. Supplements, L_C_D_. Maybe a a cheap voice recording. Well \nuser interface: Yeah we should do that.\nindustrial designer: The price?\nproject manager: Yes. Alright. Individual actions.\nindustrial designer: We all agree on that. Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: Industry designer, . User Interface, Mike. You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.\nuser interface: Yeah, we can do that.\nindustrial designer: Together or uh Yeah together.\nmarketing: Yeah togeth {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's what I got uh to hear.\nindustrial designer: How Yeah yeah, but how do I \nuser interface: But bu we stay we stay here or something?\nproject manager: Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But I think so. Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it \nmarketing: You can take the SMARTboard. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: This is the SMARTboard, so \nuser interface: Ah right. And take it to our rooms and uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype, and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera.\nuser interface: Ah, specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. So you'll get it on your em on your laptop. Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Some Some non functional tasks.\nmarketing: Have fun.\nproject manager: yeah project evaluation. So um \nmarketing: 'Kay.\nproject manager: , what are you going to do? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means, but uh you'll get uh the specifications.\nmarketing: We don't have produ product yet,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: so kind of difficult. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's why I uh But uh \nindustrial designer: You're fired. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No but {vocalsound}\nproject manager: How long do we still have? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, can we talk about something else? Uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. \nindustrial designer: Uh no I don't know anything, but maybe uh anyone else uh \nmarketing: Ajax. Nah.\nuser interface: Yeah. Um \nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nuser interface: Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers?\nindustrial designer: Round I think.\nmarketing: Um round.\nuser interface: Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Round.\nindustrial designer: To make it as uh as round as possible.\nuser interface: And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped\nproject manager: Why does \nmarketing: Curvy. Yeah.\nuser interface: with a square one in the middle.\nmarketing: So you can see you have to up or down.\nproject manager: Ah f fuck you.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But now I see the {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And this must be uh volume I think,\nproject manager: Heh?\nmarketing: and this programme.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: We can't get \nuser interface: Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume, I think.\nindustrial designer: Well th th th th th that depends uh.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, it depends, but If you turn up the volume, you always see this thingy go up. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well we uh We we j we'll just give them an uh \nmarketing: Yeah, that's right.\nindustrial designer: We'll design it,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and then they can give comments on it.\nproject manager: Ts\nuser interface: Yeah alright.\nmarketing: Yeah. Okay.\nproject manager: It doesn't work any more. We can't save them. So we'll just have them uh standing there.\nmarketing: Yeah, I noticed. You can't uh click the corners.\nproject manager: No. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's a bit uh bit a pity.\nmarketing: It's a real real great thing.\nproject manager: Well we still have uh more than five minutes. Um \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So what are we going to do? I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Let's start the design.\nproject manager: Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Well yeah. Um I think um a logo, our company logo, and the slogan should be or could be \nproject manager: Also the slogan? On the \nindustrial designer: Yeah, why not? If there's enough space, you can put uh \nuser interface: Uh I I'd say only the logo.\nindustrial designer: We'll we'll \nmarketing: O Yeah. Me too.\nuser interface: Too much text and it gets too too busy.\nindustrial designer: Well, our slogan is not very long. It's just a simple \nproject manager: We put the fashion in electronics.\nuser interface: Well it's quite a long phrase.\nindustrial designer: What is it? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We put the fashion in electronics.\nmarketing: But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts. So {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You c But you can put it on the back, on the titanium part. The logo and the and the \nuser interface: Ah the logo should be on the top I think.\nmarketing: Yeah, right. The logo \nproject manager: On the top. Yeah. Well in in in the right top corner?\nindustrial designer: Yeah they do. Well yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Right corner, yes.\nproject manager: And well you c On the back, you can put uh h At the bottom, you can put the logo with the \nindustrial designer: Right corner, or maybe here in the middle?\nuser interface: uh the text?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Just just small.\nuser interface: Uh yeah, at the back?\nmarketing: But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable, when you get off the front.\nuser interface: Well you c Well uh Yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board,\nproject manager: Yeah well \nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: You can \nindustrial designer: and you can remove the front.\nuser interface: The logo can be on on every uh front.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah, but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Carved into the material. No, you you can carve it into the titanium at the back.\nindustrial designer: I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But am I the only one, or uh \nuser interface: Yeah, on the backside.\nproject manager: Well, management would like it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well n n not not on the front side, I think.\nproject manager: The front side, no no l no slogan.\nindustrial designer: No not on the front,\nuser interface: On the back Yes, you you can, yeah, push that in,\nindustrial designer: but on the backside. Uh \nproject manager: Sorry.\nuser interface: so that it is always be there.\nindustrial designer: I think it's a nice idea, to make it more recognisable, that the next to the logo you have the slogan.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I agree.\nindustrial designer: To make more uh of an impression.\nmarketing: But not too big.\nindustrial designer: Not too big. No,\nmarketing: Just uh \nindustrial designer: very small. Not on the entire back, but uh just very small.\nmarketing: You have to make this titanium too.\nindustrial designer: But readable enough of course.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Yes, slogan from company on the back with logo\nindustrial designer: But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design.\nuser interface: Yeah I think over here the logo. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Lo Uh yeah. Or maybe here in the middle, but we'll decide later.\nproject manager: and logo also on the front but not exchange uh Uh? Hmm? Uh when changing fronts.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Alright, that's decided.\nindustrial designer: Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium? O on the front?\nproject manager: Five minutes left.\nindustrial designer: Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium,\nuser interface: Yes we could \nindustrial designer: the front is the the upper part, and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen. So \nproject manager: So a bit of titanium between?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. No no betwe\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool.\nindustrial designer: of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front, two fronts that \nuser interface: No, they have two fronts,\nmarketing: No no no no.\nuser interface: that. You you can \nproject manager: No?\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: This enti entire bottom?\nmarketing: Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_. Like dust in it and so things like that.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: When you exchange all the fronts and it's open.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile.\nuser interface: No, you can you can just And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something.\nmarketing: you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is. Because it has to be uh there all the time you know.\nindustrial designer: And then the lower part is titanium?\nuser interface: This is titanium. And this is uh \nindustrial designer: I think that's nice, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Some some kind of wei weight in it. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. Round forms.\nuser interface: F front.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh \nuser interface: Yeah. With the with the curved edge.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe you can show it. It also has the those two distinct uh \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Tada.\nindustrial designer: Mm bit like this.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's uh \nmarketing: Yeah,\nproject manager: What? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Ah.\nindustrial designer: That uh \nproject manager: So round where?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Maybe a nice touch, yeah.\nmarketing: So uh a little corner of titanium. We can't uh take a blank one.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's nice finishing touch you need.\nproject manager: Oh, yeah.\nmarketing: Or can we?\nproject manager: Yes, that also sounds uh pretty uh neat.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: So this this is the exchangeable part.\nindustrial designer: I think I'm going to buy it.\nproject manager: We want it.\nuser interface: Yeah, this is the front.\nproject manager: And it's only f twenty five Euros.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Come on.\nindustrial designer: That's a bit too much, but \nproject manager: No that's nothing.\nindustrial designer: No, no no no, but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually.\nproject manager: The Phillips remote uh costs more. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Of course, because it's my design but \nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: My design. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No our d our design, alright.\nmarketing: Taking all the credit. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well uh you two are going to work together.

We'll stay here I guess?\nmarketing: But there's a problem.\nproject manager: Well I think we can, I just  It's \nmarketing: It's not relaxing.\nuser interface: Well we can uh erase an animal I guess. Uh the fourth one.\nmarketing: Yeah. Nah that's alright, that's alright.\nindustrial designer: But don't erase my cat.\nproject manager: Yeah, o\nuser interface: Uh the fourth one is empty, isn't it?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I want to preserve it.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: \nmarketing: This one is empty.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You have to empty one huh?\nproject manager: Oh, we have a one. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: What are you doing chief?\nproject manager: So, you can uh draw a Yeah.\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Yeah I think we have to wait?\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nproject manager: Well I'll get a I'll get the message.\nindustrial designer: until the until the beep goes.\nmarketing: No \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But I don't uh Do we have to stay here,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No, I think uh \nindustrial designer: or I think we have to return first.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well you'll Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here. \nuser interface: Maybe.\nproject manager: Or get your mouse. Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates.\nindustrial designer: The high powers from above will have to tell us, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I always have a mouse next to my laptop.\nmarketing: Dream on. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I hate these \nmarketing: I I don't have a laptop.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, touch-pads, yeah.\nproject manager: Ugh.\nindustrial designer: We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No just kidding. Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too,\nmarketing: You just have to push harder.\nindustrial designer: because it becomes too too too too stressy.\nproject manager: And in your remote control.

Oh that's just bad. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons?\nindustrial designer: Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again.\nproject manager: Sorry, sorry.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So now we we have the okay,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there.

Wow.\nindustrial designer: and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside. Um well, everything else is probably user interface, so. Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And it's the whole thing's made of rubber, is that \nuser interface: Uh yeah.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah. Yeah, it has, yeah.\nuser interface: Rubber.\nmarketing: Is it to scale, or do you think you can make it a bit smaller?\nuser interface: Yeah, . Um it could be made a bit smaller, and and of course it would be and \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah, but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing, that one side was supposed to be rounder,\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nuser interface: so we said the back side round, yeah.\nindustrial designer: well, but i since it's made of rubber anyway. I I think it's it's uh \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: It l does look like the curvy\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and then the whole shape's curvy, so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah. And it's spongy as well. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I wasn't very keen on that, but yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Huh. Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it's four, up to four, up to seven, up to nine and zero, z zero here.\nproject manager: Six seven eight nine. I like that.\nuser interface: Yeah. And then, well this is on off button. It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red, so it's it's kind of user friendly.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here, previous and ne prevon prevon next.\nmarketing: So where's the volume?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: The volume is is scrolling.\nindustrial designer: It's on the side.\nuser interface: On the side,\nmarketing: Ah, you did get that in then,\nuser interface: this one. Yeah you just do it like this.\nmarketing: mm-hmm.\nuser interface: And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid, because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here.\nmarketing: Oh okay, .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: See? So the volume is you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, okay, there there you have the screen\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen, you just push the cen mm the middle button.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Cool. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button.\nindustrial designer: Uh no, we we'd not put \nuser interface: A mute button.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials.\nuser interface: Well, we'll have this on the screen, on the display.\nproject manager: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you \nmarketing: On the wheel, like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute.\nindustrial designer: Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know, the main menu will have various options.\nuser interface: Well, but the but the mute yeah, the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right?\nproject manager: But if you hold it in,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, but it's a scroll and click, isn't it?\nproject manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in?\nmarketing: Okay, cool.\nuser interface: Okay, yeah, okay.\nmarketing: So that that solves the whole mute issue.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah. And okay, so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it.\nproject manager: no.\nuser interface: You can't really see it in the interface.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's hidden in there somewhere.\nuser interface: Yeah. And we do have the logo on it as well.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm, very good.\nuser interface: So I think it \nproject manager: And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: .\nindustrial designer: Cool.\nuser interface: Yeah, I think um we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: We ran out of resources here, so. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: In the actual one.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You can have a look. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So if you have questions.\nproject manager: Very good, let's have a look.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Test it out. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour, I guess.\nmarketing: Yeah, oh, we hold the remote.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh, but it it does feel all cold and slimy.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I hate Play-Do, it's just minging.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But yeah, uh that's cool, cool.\nproject manager: Very good.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay, so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: and then we'll there \nindustrial designer: Yeah, see the budget.\nproject manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues, but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and cut some of the prices that way.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Wales. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Wales, for example. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.

Um, you know. Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. Um you know, so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah, we did manage to do that, or oh no, we really forgot about that.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Cool, so these are what they are. Oh \nproject manager: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. Is that right?\nmarketing: Yes, I did have A_, B_, C_, and D_ down here, but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points.\nproject manager: Mm dots, never mind.\nmarketing: Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_, B_, C_, and D_, then that would be really good.\nindustrial designer: I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, the yeah, it's definitely attractive. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, I agree.\nuser interface: Oh, the locatable thing we actually forgot.\nmarketing: Well, I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_?\nproject manager: Yeah, just prepare one now.\nuser interface: Yeah. Shall I just prepare it now?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: It will be red, too.\nmarketing: Cool. Okay. So, be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say?\nindustrial designer: So?\nproject manager: I reckon it \nuser interface: S seven was th the maximum, yeah?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I I go for seven.\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nmarketing: Oh we're all so proud of the .\nproject manager: Seven, yeah, it's terribly sexy. Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, so that'll be a seven for A_.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Could oh no, you can't whilst that's up there. Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in.\nproject manager: Ah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Excellent. Except we can't \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But we can we can \nmarketing: But that's alright.\nproject manager: uh we can if we \nindustrial designer: I can I can take note uh uh \nmarketing: If you take a note of them, and then I'll put them in in a minute.\nproject manager: then yeah, I'll take a note, it's fine.\nmarketing: Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven for A_?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Cool, okay. Does it match the operating behaviour of the user?\nindustrial designer: Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people,\nproject manager: I think it does.\nuser interface: I would think yes, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. I mean \nindustrial designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nproject manager: Alright.\nuser interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: But that's gonna be a problem,\nindustrial designer: But then yeah.\nproject manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem,\nmarketing: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen.\nindustrial designer: because i i it is operatable.\nuser interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: so they just \nmarketing: Yeah, but I mean because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-handed people can't normally write right-handed,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: but they can normally do most things right-handed,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: so I would say it's not such a big issue.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, because I mean anyway, right-handed people would be able to scroll with it,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: so i if the majority are right-handed, it's uh \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation, maybe give it a five, I would say?\nproject manager: Um \nmarketing: What do you what do you all think?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Six.\nuser interface: Or maybe six, because it's just one one i one among the issues,\nproject manager: Yeah, I think I think for um \nuser interface: I mean. Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean most people are right-handed, so in in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good, but we might want to flag it for management, they want might want to um \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: One more thing is that i\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up, right,\nproject manager: They \nindustrial designer: so it opens on the side. So \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: No, yeah, but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah, I mean yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: So it won't be a problem,\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So you guys can decide wh whether \nuser interface: it will be and it will be it won't be heavy.\nindustrial designer: Oops.\nmarketing: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah well yeah,\nproject manager: The length is gonna be difficu\nuser interface: but it's it's a bit long. It's a little bit long.\nmarketing: Yeah um \nuser interface: Well, I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah.\nmarketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah?\nindustrial designer: Uh this this kind of uh makes it more \nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Because \nuser interface: S uh slightly smaller.\nindustrial designer: and two, it might interfere with the I_R_ channel.\nmarketing: So you have to keep that side flat.\nuser interface: Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping, but y you know, as long as that side's flat, than that will work.\nindustrial designer: Right. Okay.\nmarketing: Okay. Um okay, so C_. Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_?\nindustrial designer: No, we have a locator.\nproject manager: No, we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot.\nmarketing: There's a locator. Cool, so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though,\nuser interface: Mm that you stick on T_V_.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: doesn't it? To make it beep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Or a buzzer.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included, so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds, so yeah.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So that's two, so that's seven, yeah. It's locatable?\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: Fabulous. D_.\nindustrial designer: Intuitive, completely intuitive. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. If uh uh if this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and it's I th I think it's \nproject manager: I'd say six, 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one, rather than the way you've got it. I really like the way you have it,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to.\nindustrial designer: Intuitive.\nmarketing: Yeah, and I mean d\nindustrial designer: And uh even the scroll, it's a it's a new technology\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni\nproject manager: Might be \nindustrial designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology, I mean once they get used to it.\nproject manager: But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: So, should we maybe say f a five\nindustrial designer: So l\nmarketing: and say it is intuitive,\nproject manager: Five?\nmarketing: but it's different, so, do you know, I mean it's obvious how to use it,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: but you might have to think about it first. So we give that one a five, you think?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay. I'm gonna give a seven in everything, so. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yep.\nproject manager: I'm happy with five?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm glad you're accepting this. It has taken a little while, hasn't it? Um intuitive but Sorry, it's really hard to write on those.\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I just went a bit mad, didn't I?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um okay, cool, E_, okay. Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here, so possibly for left-handed. Investigate.\nproject manager: Yep. But otherwise it's superb.\nmarketing: So, should we give it a six?\nproject manager: Six.\nmarketing: Six?\nuser interface: Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: well mm I mean I d uh I dunno, I mean the the repetitive stress things,\nindustrial designer: .\nuser interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, unless you are a all the time sitting.\nuser interface: yeah? See.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, so it's kinda \nindustrial designer: Yeah, I I think it is ergonomic.\nmarketing: I used to send fifty texts a day, you know,\nproject manager: Well we've banned them from \nmarketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest.\nindustrial designer: And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's varied.\nmarketing: Okay, so we give that a six,\nproject manager: Yeah. Six?\nmarketing: yeah. Okay, F_.\nuser interface: Yeah,  it does have yeah.\nindustrial designer: Absolutely.\nproject manager: Voice control have seven.\nmarketing: Hang on, how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there? That's just \nproject manager: Ah, that's the second one. So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score, but not on the previous slide.\nmarketing: Oh okay, cool. Um right, so.\nindustrial designer: So it has voice control.\nmarketing: Yes, so that's a seven then.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nmarketing: Um, cool.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: G_ technologically innovative.\nindustrial designer: Anyway it ha yeah,\nuser interface: Technologi well \nindustrial designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually new.\nuser interface: Yeah. Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well, which is yeah, it's kind of new.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, but I mean you don't \nproject manager: All of the components have been used in other things before.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, but they've been brought together in a remote.\nuser interface: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new.\nmarketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think.\nproject manager: But do yeah, yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: .\nproject manager: What do you reckon, five, six?\nmarketing: Yeah, what do you all think?\nuser interface: Six.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Six?\nuser interface: I mean how how far can you go with a remote control, really?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well, that's it, I mean \nuser interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really, hasn't it?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So, I don't think many peop\nproject manager: Space remote.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's it, they can take it with them.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Put fashion in electronics.\nindustrial designer: Absolutely. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, isn't it fashionable?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The carrot banana remote. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, sure.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's the maximum fashion.\nmarketing: So, we give it seven, and we write \nuser interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days, so.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: There we go.\nindustrial designer: I think that's a .\nuser interface: So I think we've done very well, but \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Very good.\nuser interface: What's the assessment?\nmarketing: So, we need the average here, so we got \nuser interface: The average is about six and something.\nproject manager: Yeah, one.\nuser interface: A little bit over six.\nmarketing: Seven \nindustrial designer: There are how many sixes?\nproject manager: Or a seven.\nindustrial designer: One, two, three.\nmarketing: So we've got four sevens,\nuser interface: No, wait, a little bit under six.\nmarketing: so that's twenty eight,\nindustrial designer: Three.\nuser interface: No, wait.\nmarketing: three sixes,\nindustrial designer: And one five.\nmarketing: eighteen.\nuser interface: Oh, three sixes, okay, yeah.\nproject manager: Fifty one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\nindustrial designer: Okay, twenty eight, thirty eight, fo forty six. Forty six and five, fifty one.\nproject manager: Six point point \nindustrial designer: Fifty one divided by \nuser interface: Six point something, yeah.\nmarketing: Two three four Seven eight.\nproject manager: about six point five.\nuser interface: Six point five, yeah.\nproject manager: Close enough.\nmarketing: Okay, that's pretty good, I think. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's all you've got at the moment, or did you have anything more?\nmarketing: Um no, that's it,\nproject manager: That's it?\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: Alright. So, finance. And we'll see if we can unscrew this first.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Cool, there we go.\nproject manager: Sorry, this is I'm just um \nmarketing: . There we go and there are the marks.\nproject manager: Beautiful.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Not anymore.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Computer no signal?\nindustrial designer: Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit.\nproject manager: Adjusting. There we go. Okay, so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria. And now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Can you read that? Almost.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: More or less. Um I started filling it in, but of course these are provisional, so we have to go down. No hand dynamo, right?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: One simple battery.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: No kinetic energy, no solar. The chip, we're going for an advanced chip on print.\nindustrial designer: Advanced, yeah.\nproject manager: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker.\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Um single-curved surface, so that we can fold it.\nuser interface: Yeah, yes.\nproject manager: Case material we said rubber.\nuser interface: Rubber.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: I don't know what special colour means.\nindustrial designer: Mm anything uh I think which is not more .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think something coloured, yeah, probably. So I think this is probably special co no?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It could be \nmarketing: Yeah, but rubber comes coloured, doesn't it? You know.\nproject manager: Rub rubber comes coloured,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured, it's different.\nuser interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it,\nproject manager: Yeah, let's leave it as zero, 'cause it's easy. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah yeah, okay.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: you might end up having to take off the sample sensor.\nproject manager: We we're definitely going to have to \nuser interface: We have pushbuttons,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: so we've got pushbutton, and then we've\nuser interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well.\nproject manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had, no?\nindustrial designer: No uh we we have uh yeah.\nuser interface: S yeah, yeah, we had, for muting, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: And we have L_C_ display\nproject manager: And button supplements.\nuser interface: and yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm no.\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: . No.\nindustrial designer: We don't have \nproject manager: No. No?\nindustrial designer: we're not using any of that.\nuser interface: Yeah, but what do we ha we have L_C_ display, but but the wh but the s spinning wheel \nproject manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there. I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though,\nuser interface: Okay, let's yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: haven't we?\nproject manager: I think the pushbutton oh.\nmarketing: 'Cause then you have \nproject manager: I don't know if that's one \nmarketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it? Not counting anything, we'd still be in budget.\nproject manager: Yeah. That seems unlikely.\nindustrial designer: Huh?\nproject manager: Push what uh\nindustrial designer: Wh wh what is the limit? Uh.\nmarketing: Twelve point five.\nproject manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we \nuser interface: We have to count all of them, or yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm I don't think so, no.\nproject manager: I don't think that makes sense.\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface,\nmarketing: Well it doesn't, but it uh \nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five, it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display,\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: And L_C_ display.\nindustrial designer: so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah. So, as we can see, that's way too expensive down here.\nindustrial designer: Wh wh what's our criteria?\nmarketing: This sample sensor .\nproject manager: Our budget's twelve point five.\nindustrial designer: Uh okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there.\nproject manager: Yeah, so that has implications though for the .\nindustrial designer: Uh it does not have for voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: For the locator.\nmarketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really, isn't it?\nindustrial designer: Mm and the locator also goes away.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: We can afford to get rid of it.\nuser interface: But it was very no innovative\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So that means no locator, does it?\nuser interface: innovativeness . Well um yeah.\nmarketing: I mean does \nproject manager: What else does it need?\nuser interface: Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive, but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps.\nproject manager: Yeah, 'cause the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated then just a beeping thing.\nuser interface: This would be Yeah, yeah yeah {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: there you record your samples your speech samples and \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, okay, so we \nindustrial designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber, so it's probably a flat surface rubber. Uh I mean uh um yeah.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: Okay, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um \nproject manager: Right, so we need one fifty off.\nmarketing: See, I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing, 'cause \nproject manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel. We could do \nindustrial designer: So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_?\nuser interface: Yeah, then then we would be in the b budget.\nindustrial designer: If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll, right? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button.\nuser interface: Yeah b no no, you can push this one, but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing.\nmarketing: But that's well you would just have to to spin it down .\nproject manager: Yeah. You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: No w w w but ha\nmarketing: So that's point three.\nindustrial designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing.\nuser interface: But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well.\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: If you \nmarketing: I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more. That's the spin wheel though, isn't it? Didn't that come with the L_C_ \nproject manager: That's with the L_C_\nindustrial designer: That comes with the L_C_D_?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: We decided, 'cause it's not on our list.\nindustrial designer: Oh so so the the this is \nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: The scroll wheel is on the side.\nindustrial designer: . So we're adding costs for right, okay uh I mean I think this is good.\nmarketing: S so we're point three over.\nuser interface: So \nproject manager: We're point three over at the moment.\nmarketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether\nproject manager: It's nothing n\nmarketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume. Could b still put them on the side. But yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah,\nmarketing: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool, but \nproject manager: I have \nindustrial designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here, up for up and down.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: On the side.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm uh it sounds good actually, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Okay, yeah.\nproject manager: Rather than having three different things that people have to do.\nindustrial designer: .\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: There we go. Oh look, we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses.\nmarketing: Yeah, well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour.\nmarketing: Yeah, but \nproject manager: So that's alright. We we'll leave it at that \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour, if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it,\nindustrial designer: We have, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Excellent. Alright. So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria, as a result of doing that?\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: Not really, no.\nmarketing: No, I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep L_C_D_ display.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway,\nindustrial designer: Um yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But we lose the locator.\nproject manager: Alright then.\nmarketing: Really?\nproject manager: We're gonna have a beep.\nuser interface: Well we're going to have a beeping thing.\nindustrial designer: So instead of speaker, .\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: But yeah, it's it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep, so we still have the locate.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Cool. That's not a very exciting colour. I think you should make it more vegetable-like. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Tha\nuser interface: Which colour, the the colour of the phone or the colour of the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh the the beeper thing.\nproject manager: .\nmarketing: It \nuser interface: But it can be yellow as well. It can come in the same colour as the the case.\nproject manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I think Jen wants it to vibrate.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, I know I know, my pen vibrates.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You know, your pen vibrates?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But only for a very short time. Um okay. So looks like we've designed a banana.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well done, team. Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting, so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went, um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product.\nindustrial designer: I think it mm \nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Feedback? Ideas?\nuser interface: Yeah mm, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah I think there was there was room for creativity. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um we kap kept a adding things randomly.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So, had we known \nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like, okay, so we can have that lot, let's just throw it together and do what we can.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that or not, yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting, that that worked in terms of.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, mm.\nmarketing: I think 'cause the meetings were so regular, you know. It wasn't like we were alone for very long,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so you didn't st go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Banana. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and then, you know, come back three days later and Jen's going look, look, it vibrates and it looks like a banana.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um yeah, so yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, the m the means were very very good, the means we used.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm, the whiteboard digital pens.\nuser interface: And the pens. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh I like the pens.\nproject manager: We like the pens. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I want one. That would just be so cool, to d do all your notes and s\nproject manager: Yeah, you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah,\nproject manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: that's it's it's \nproject manager: They great?\nindustrial designer: I wonder what one of these costs. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went?\nmarketing: I don't think you should say that was the recording.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh okay.\nmarketing: Okay, cover up the microphone. Alright, let's take it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yep. Shh. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint, 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there,\nmarketing: It is a bit limiting, isn't it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: yep.\nuser interface: Yeah, and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the \nmarketing: Yeah. The thing flew in,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing, 'cause there wasn't time for that, so yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. That's alright, that always irritates me anyway, yeah.\nmarketing: Not that you can do that on the board, either. We could make some little \nuser interface: But yeah, but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, totally, I mean that was fairly tight anyway, I mean especially with that last-minute alteration.\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: back it, this is just had to be changed\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing:. And yeah, so cool.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I have no stake in it.\nuser interface: I was I was satisfied with with the leadership, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, definitely.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: You weren't like a a dictating leader, so that was always good.\nproject manager: You have to say that, 'cause I'm taking the notes.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I'll leave the room and you can have another go.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I know you've got the pen, you might attack me with it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Better than that than the banana.\nuser interface: And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely, yeah.\nproject manager: I think it worked quite well.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit?\nuser interface: To express them mm mm\nindustrial designer: Mm. I guess it was a fairly small group,\nuser interface: no.\nindustrial designer: so all of us got to express our opinions, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: . New ideas found. Not quite sure what about.\nuser interface: Well it's it's it's pretty new,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really, all this flipping open thing and \nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't know, I don't go shopping for remote controls that often, maybe somebody's already though of it.\nuser interface: Yeah, neither neither do I,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this, actually, so.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah. I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay.\nproject manager: Yeah, that's right. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That looks boring, I'll see if anyone's made a remote control.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Patent patent patent. Mm.\nmarketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new,\nproject manager: Banana remote.\nmarketing: but we've got no way of finding out. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That vibrates {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Flip. Vibrate\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it.\nproject manager:. And uh yeah. Nothing that you really want. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: True. Yeah. Okay. So, costs are within budget,\nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: Yes. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: well within budget, including a little what have we got? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee. Um we've evaluated the project.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: And it's fabulous.\nproject manager: You've got the scores. Can you put that in the project documents file?\nmarketing: It's in the project documents .\nproject manager: It's in there already. And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with. Were there any was there anything that you found difficult, or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope?\nuser interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Otherwise it's it's all fine.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, sometimes it's like a little bit rushed.\nindustrial designer: I thought that was good though, because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay then. Um I think we're still well within our time.\nmarketing: Yeah, we've got like five minutes left.\nproject manager: We've got about five minutes left, but if we've finished, then we've finished. We're just too too efficient\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We certainly are,\nproject manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yes.\nproject manager: So I would say that's the end of that meeting.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Thank you, team.\nuser interface: Yeah, it was a pleasure working with you.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, same here. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It was very productive day and \nmarketing: We could draw animals on the board again.\nproject manager: Mm uh no. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm uh no. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't think so. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You can make some animals.\nmarketing: I don't like Play-Doh, no.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh, you don't like anim\nmarketing: It's just minging. It smells so bad.\nuser interface: It doesn't?\nmarketing: It does.\nuser interface: Smells quite nice. Smells very sweet.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Right, so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it.\nindustrial designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent?\nproject manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not.\nmarketing: No, it hasn't been.\nproject manager: Um presumably I have to \nmarketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now?\nproject manager: I don't see why you can't stay here, really.\nmarketing: Okay, so the other way. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Did I save this one? Production costs.\nuser interface: I made your animal for you.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It was supposed to be pink.

Please, next slide. We analysed all the fruits\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and contacted NASA, and uh made some real good \nproject manager: MASA? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. If you can see this, and the stars are showing that . And um, s society will accept that.

You can have a look at it, and That's all I wanted to say.\nmarketing: Ah.\nuser interface: Now it's technical specification by our colleague.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: So \nmarketing: Oh, there is a button missing.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: This this is really flexible. You can add your buttons.\nmarketing: It's in option. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. So function, mm \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So, as we discussed, we have to switch on switch off whenever we want. And so, we have buttons and using L_C_D_, or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_, and then do on and off. Then you ha you'll have volume control. So, you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And we have some L_C_D_ controls. Like, m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_, or you don't want you can just use normal button.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: And we have speech recognition. Here you have microphone, and then it date records your voice, and then it try to recognise.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And it can also do the action.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And location finder. And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser. You can just say, where is my remote control.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Or uh, you can just give some nickname to your remote control, like Bobby .\nproject manager: Bobby. Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Hey, babe.\nindustrial designer: And then, it will say hi. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Bob. Hey Bob. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, hi, and then you can use it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay,\nproject manager: Hmm.

Yeah. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Material, we want to stick to titanium. We will send, we want to {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Fruit smelling spongy titanium. I didn't know it exist, but that's great.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, or s So, we want to have simple and perfect shapes, like I shown in these phones. You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs. And you can choose colours on your day for each day, or even many colours.\nmarketing: Ha.\nproject manager: Ho-ho. That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium?\nmarketing: You mean we can change the colour uh of th\nindustrial designer: For the L_C_D_.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah okay, for the L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: With titanium it's it is silver.\nmarketing: Tit titanium is \nuser interface: We are still working on titanium.\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: So, r we'll start with L_C_D_.\nmarketing: Uh, okay.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm, yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You can ask Bob. It's Tuesday. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Hey, you know you're theme today. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, Bob, please.

{"fname": "product_dev_15", "dialogue": "marketing: Okay. Oh I totally Yeah 'cause I moved it. 'S put it over here. Then we don't have to worry about it.\nuser interface: Ready for this?\nproject manager: All set? Cool. Alright, it is PowerPoint time. I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: which is kind of fun.\nuser interface: Oh man. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um, I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me. It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting.\nindustrial designer: Oh really?\nproject manager: I think. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Huh.\nproject manager: I don't know. Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes, s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, uh, I will open them slowly, no? Wait for it, wait for it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah that's not you. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No. That's how the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Wait.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: This is, this is very high-powered stuff here, double-clicking, there we go. So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer, uh or from Nathan, and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under, what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition, I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice. That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users. Um, and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at. So. That's sorted, back to the main meet here, um, go ahead and take it away guys.\nindustrial designer: Well. Uh, we have assembled our prototype, um. What's to be said about it? Um, we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting, um. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions, um. This is going to be the on off button\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here, d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons. And then, for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on. But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away, um. As far as the uh whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah.\nproject manager: Nice. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: why not?\nmarketing: Fair enough.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Of course, if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off. Um.\nproject manager: Perfect.\nindustrial designer: Go ahead.\nuser interface: No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: um f we call it fruity\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: if you will. Um. Right, um,\nmarketing: Appropriate, okay.\nuser interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nmarketing: Mm 'kay.\nuser interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nmarketing: It is an option.\nuser interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there.\nproject manager: Oh, right.\nindustrial designer: That's this here.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah. I see.\nuser interface: Um. So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption. Um, what other things do we see here, well, um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: um, so I think that will work well with regards to our market. Um and uh let's see, well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available. Um uh do you have anything else to add to that?\nindustrial designer: Um I worried about the materials, it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh, it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped. Um, and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel.\nuser interface: It's actually important to note that the television, uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that, that i it actually is edible inside.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Fact, I dunno if you noticed, but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen,\nproject manager: Oh well done yeah, yeah oh ok\nindustrial designer: I thought that was kinda nice.\nmarketing: Nice.\nindustrial designer: This was actually an apple on the inside.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: This \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Do we need to worry about um rot factors? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh\nmarketing: Oh okay, there's preservatives involved,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: polymer yeah.\nmarketing: we don't need to worry,\nindustrial designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves,\nuser interface: It's fine.\nmarketing: okay.\nindustrial designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that, but \nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: Fair enough.\nproject manager: Edible televisions, it's a wave of the future. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No but \nuser interface: It's pos a possible new product.\nmarketing: It's a couple years off at least. Okay.\nuser interface: Um, but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote,\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature. Um, did we come in under budget?\nindustrial designer: Uh we did, yeah. This cost well to put this into um production, we're looking at about what was our goal? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um, so I was quite pleased with that.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: One thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons, but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down.\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nindustrial designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology, um for example the voice recognition,\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm. Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option?\nindustrial designer: And Oh no, we haven't talked about that yet have we?\nuser interface: So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um, but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with. Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier\nmarketing: Mm 'kay.\nuser interface: and um, I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yeah.\nuser interface: And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um, so.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Cool.\nindustrial designer: Any questions?\nproject manager: No, no\nmarketing: Do we have um other, for lack of a better word, skins? Covers?\nproject manager: I think that's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or?\nindustrial designer: Um, do you wanna answer this one\nmarketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet?\nindustrial designer: or do you want me to answer it?\nuser interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material uh.\nmarketing: Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Oh I see,\nmarketing: I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: right, um.\nindustrial designer: Um, well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like \nmarketing: Okay. Just veneer really,\nuser interface: Right.\nmarketing: yeah. Okay.\nuser interface: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that.\nmarketing: And the whole thing \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay\nuser interface: So I mean there are I \nmarketing: Right\nuser interface: we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials\nmarketing: Yeah. There's Okay.\nuser interface: which I think worked out fine. We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green.\nmarketing: Mm 'kay. Okay, very cool.\nindustrial designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate, it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it, it locks into place such that, you know, it's pretty permanent but at the same time, if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: if you know what I mean.\nmarketing: Yep. It's still an option if we need it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Very cool, nice job.\nproject manager: Right, yeah thanks guys that's very, very good work. I like it, brilliant. Um, what we need to discuss now is the finance of it, um I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance. Um, it's a spreadsheet of the parts {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nproject manager: and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um.\nindustrial designer: Ooh.\nproject manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly, but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here, we've got this it's a solar cell thing right?\nindustrial designer: Right\nproject manager: With a back-up battery?\nindustrial designer: uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there,\nproject manager: With the ba okay. Um\nindustrial designer: yep.\nproject manager: and \nuser interface: The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area. Yeah.\nproject manager: Clever, clever, well done. Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. It's just making use of the same space and the same materials,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay. Um and the case, it's more of a single-curved case, I guess would be that be the general \nindustrial designer: Yeah, one big curve I guess you could say.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout. Um. Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um. And um a special I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, special.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well, don't you? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional,\nproject manager: Yeah, it's it's quite unique.\nindustrial designer: I like to think of it as unconventional.\nproject manager: I like it, yeah it's So it looks like\nmarketing: M come in at sixteen?\nproject manager: a bit over budget, um.\nindustrial designer: Oh. Huh, doesn't match up does it?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery. Uh \nindustrial designer: How do you feel about that?\nuser interface: I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features, being environmental and without the batteries and what not, although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: what am I gonna do?\nmarketing: Mm k.\nindustrial designer: People'd be real upset. I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery,\nmarketing: True.\nindustrial designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have.\nproject manager: Hmm. What's difficult, we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now,\nmarketing: Nah.\nproject manager: it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way. Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it, um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural, new thing, but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing\nmarketing: I mean \nuser interface: I mean that's what sets us apart\nmarketing: Which, it's \nuser interface: right?\nmarketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market, I mean that's where we started from, so I don't know, and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: And the reality is you know, for me from an ideological stand point, I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell, but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here\nmarketing: Right. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here\nproject manager: It's either or.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: and maybe move ahead with the project, without the solar cell.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I guess we might have to do that.\nmarketing: I think unfortunately that's our best option.\nindustrial designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it? Of twelve fifty.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah,.\nmarketing: It kind of \nproject manager: um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the \nuser interface: Savings.\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a mm-mm, um, nor would changing the case materials.\nmarketing: Mm-mm.\nproject manager: Um. So yeah that looks like to be the only thing. So that would be the \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: it's a major change but Yeah. Alright, so\nindustrial designer: Gotta do what you gotta do.\nproject manager: we're in agreement on that.\nmarketing: Unfortunately I think we are.\nuser interface: No, I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah.\nproject manager: Right. Moving along swiftly. Um, so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over.\nmarketing: That would be me. Um cord?\nproject manager: Ah of course, sorry.\nmarketing: No problem.\nproject manager: Whoosh.\nmarketing: Can you reach,\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: that would be great, thank you.\nproject manager: That'd be great {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I didn't even do that one on purpose either,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: damn. Okay, um, basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do, these are the things that look like we feel they're important. Um so I was looking at basic design things, does it fulfil its functions as a remote? Is the design what we wanted it to do? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for? Um. Basic questions like, you know, does it turn on? Does it respond to voice recognition? And overall, in general, it looks like it's coming up to par.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Um, the only thing is with with the pull-out panel, that is, can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface, um that looked like it was coming up rough, but then, once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense.\nindustrial designer: Really good.\nmarketing: So I think overall we're headed in the right direction. So.\nuser interface: They like that spongy feel.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. It looks like it's going over well, so\nuser interface: And the paging function works well,\nindustrial designer: Six?\nuser interface: that's good to hear,\nmarketing: we're we're good yeah.\nuser interface: we worked hard on that one.\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nindustrial designer: We did.\nmarketing: Yeah. It's I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff, but for now, what we've got is working in the range we need it for, so it's all good.\nindustrial designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel\nmarketing: That's everything from me.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: but it's okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, it is a set-back, but \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay, do you need the cord back?\nproject manager: Um yeah,\nuser interface: W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again\nproject manager: I was just go on.\nindustrial designer: I know.\nuser interface: that we're \nproject manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they?\nindustrial designer: True.\nuser interface: I guess that's true.\nproject manager: Right. So, um, this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair, um. I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to. Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and that is gonna go into my report. So I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked, I guess, um.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: As in within the team or?\nproject manager: I think so yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: I think it's I mm-hmm, I think so. I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay.\nmarketing: It is now,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: you're in charge there you go. so {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Whatever.\nproject manager: Um right, um so any thoughts?\nindustrial designer: Are we considering these points here?\nmarketing: Um.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: I think they're starting blocks yeah.\nproject manager: What do you guys feel about the process?\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Um, you know I think in general, for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: considering the little amount of input we had going in. Um, and the technology has definitely been a help, it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff.\nuser interface: We didn't use the whiteboard at all.\nproject manager: No, no whiteboard. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: No, we didn't. We could now if that'd make up for it\nuser interface: And \nmarketing: but really \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints, doesn't really matter.\nuser interface: Um, also had I not been intrigued about the pen, I don't think I woulda used it at all, I didn't write barely anything.\nmarketing: Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's true.\nmarketing: just 'cause I liked the pen, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Uh.\nproject manager: Was pretty cool tack though.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Definitely.\nmarketing: Mm. I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: As you write your personal coach.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but I didn't get a response {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: What if you get a response two or three months from now?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we'll see.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: That'd be weird.\nmarketing: Okay that would be kinda creepy.\nproject manager: Attempts to contact coach ineffective.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: what kind of coaching is that really? What if I really needed something. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity, I don't we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us, um.\nmarketing: I think so. And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: With the natural look.\nproject manager: Very natural look.\nindustrial designer: That's very natural.\nmarketing: Organic, really. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And highly resourceful team mates might I add\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: which is always a plus.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think, yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually, I mean.\nuser interface: I think the teamwork was good as well.\nmarketing: Mm yeah, I'm impressed.\nindustrial designer: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh, we used every bit.\nmarketing: Nice. All four of those little containers. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I guess \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: we only had four, wasn't enough.\nmarketing: You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I know it could have been amazing.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh well.\nproject manager: What did you guys think about the the the roles?\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: They were good.\nindustrial designer: Yeah it's f kind of fun, it was \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough.\nmarketing: True.\nindustrial designer: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Do your own.\nindustrial designer: which was kind of fun.\nmarketing: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all.\nproject manager: That's true, I I got this spreadsheet.\nmarketing: Nothing, I didn't even get an email,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: like\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: that was it. So, yeah, I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know, fill in the blanks on your own, level of creativity upped.\nuser interface: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to \nmarketing: Whatever.\nproject manager: Of what to do.\nuser interface: well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, that wasn't very much. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You know \nuser interface: um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: because that was kind of the interface portion\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: which was what the whole project was about\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: Mm, mm.\nuser interface: uh\nmarketing: Hmm, very much so.\nuser interface: but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. That was fun. I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you\nuser interface: which was fine. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time.\nmarketing: Yeah, already having the formatted stuff helped a lot. Very much so.\nproject manager: Cool.\nuser interface: And I think your leadership was quite good.\nindustrial designer: It was really good yeah.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it.\nmarketing: Yeah. That's kind of a good thing though,\nproject manager: I felt like I slipped into it a lot.\nindustrial designer: It's kinda fun.\nmarketing: you know, give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey.\nproject manager: I dunno.\nuser interface: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role?\nproject manager: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management. I usually organise crap,\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: it's one thing to do, you know set up a party with your friends,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you know?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Little different.\nproject manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the, yeah, suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and I knew we were all lying through our teeth,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I had to admit, as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh, th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window.\nmarketing: other than that \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I could only imagine. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe in in Legos you know? Be fun with Legos too,\nuser interface: Possibly.\nproject manager: like make a remote control or spaceship, we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos \nuser interface: Oh yeah,\nmarketing: Yeah. Totally.\nproject manager: everybody knows best spaceships ever.\nuser interface: still have 'em.\nproject manager: Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all?\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nmarketing: I think so.\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No I, no I dunno, I d I I dunno,\nindustrial designer: You don't.\nproject manager: I don't I I was just I \nmarketing: Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's true huh?\nmarketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming, use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work, not like three hours' worth of meetings.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team. I mean\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That's true.\nproject manager: Yeah. Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like, kind of like, like hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It d\nmarketing: Yeah that is kind of \nproject manager: But yeah. Interesting. It's kind of fascinating wasn't it? I mean the whole process of \nindustrial designer: Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board?\nproject manager: I don't know. I I don't know if there was a ri I th\nmarketing: Mine was the mics. I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's it\nmarketing: I was afraid I was gonna break something actually.\nindustrial designer: 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board.\nmarketing: Yeah. True, but it didn't even occur to me as an option,\nproject manager: Nor I.\nmarketing: I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't.\nuser interface: I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for.\nmarketing: True.\nuser interface: Um, because I've got this laptop. Standard,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me.\nproject manager: I wanna see the output files from these um, from the digital paper.\nmarketing: Yeah. Well it looks really professional.\nproject manager: I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized\nmarketing: I know.\nproject manager: because my handwriting is crap.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nproject manager: I mean, just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something.\nindustrial designer: that's it. Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I know, I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay, well not entirely, but still, I doodled less than I usually do.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like. You know, like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here.\nuser interface: So is this all we need to get through?\nproject manager: I dunno, I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about.\nmarketing: I guess.\nindustrial designer: New ideas.\nmarketing: Um.\nuser interface: Is it \nmarketing: It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that?\nproject manager: Well, that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there,\nmarketing: That slide was like that?\nproject manager: mm-hmm. I didn't change this one at all.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Well.\nproject manager: Um ch\nindustrial designer: I guess we're on the right track.\nproject manager: Yeah well. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: W I kinda like th\nindustrial designer: No, none.\nmarketing: Uh I think they still do their job.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah you can't \nindustrial designer: I think they're fine actually.\nmarketing: I am thinking outside the little square box though, with literally in like form\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, maybe a s a circle would be alright, different.\nmarketing: I don't Yeah.\nproject manager: Does kinda make you wonder, I mean, how much can you do with a remote control? It's like inventing a new car. Yeah yeah, you can \nmarketing: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: you know? Don't know.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um. 'Kay.\nuser interface: What is that? Our limited ability to think outside the box?\nproject manager: So this was other costs.\nmarketing: Kind of.\nindustrial designer: Are we back into project mood?\nproject manager: I dunno. I think this is\nmarketing: Oh, how long was our meeting supposed to be?\nproject manager: forty ish\nmarketing: How much time do we have left?\nproject manager: I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval, um. I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing. Like, what like you know what am I really doing,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: you know what is \nmarketing: Yeah, at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway\nuser interface: Why?\nproject manager: Hey.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: so type away. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Huh I think it was the real .\nmarketing: You know, you know what I mean\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore.\nindustrial designer: Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and then by the time I got to the last one I was like, you know, not very much.\nmarketing: Whatever. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Very much, yeah.\nuser interface: which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning.\nproject manager: I actually didn't do that at all though,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em. I di\nuser interface: Oh I added like five slides too,\nmarketing: See\nproject manager: Oh.\nindustrial designer: Did you really?\nuser interface: but I \nmarketing: I only got blank ones.\nindustrial designer: I just got blank ones\nproject manager: What? Really?\nindustrial designer: and \nmarketing: My slides were all blank, they'd have a title maybe\nuser interface: Yeah, mine too.\nmarketing: and they were just empty.\nproject manager: Did they not have they didn't like uh mine \nindustrial designer: Me too.\nproject manager: yeah they didn't come like this? Like with this was what it looks like. This is what that looked like,\nmarketing: Like with those words already on it?\nproject manager: literally, just like that.\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Interesting.\nmarketing: I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-huh huh huh.\nindustrial designer: I deleted slides.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think I added a slide one time.\nuser interface: I added many slides every time {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hey\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: with the whole new background being innovative, yeah that was class.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That was pretty cool, it was a high moment of the whole experiment.\nuser interface: Um.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Interesting. Any other thoughts come to mind?\nmarketing: I wanna know how our product would fare.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think it would fail, I think\nmarketing: I can't just leave it there.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it'd be a huge disaster, especially if it looks like that. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think it would take extensive marketing, okay, an apple with a red button on top, even I am sceptical. But you know the whole \nuser interface: Even you.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face.\nproject manager: Yeah but \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I know it is.\nindustrial designer: It's a happy face.\nuser interface: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Builds. Mm.\nuser interface: I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I I noticed that. By accident.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that happened to be consumed. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Interesting. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well huh. An interesting day all in all I would say.\nproject manager: Uh, yeah, I'd say so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's uh \nuser interface: So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups, especially between culture groups and what not.\nproject manager: Mm, I know.\nmarketing: I know.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically. You know from the the the basics to the conce\nindustrial designer: I wanna see a \nmarketing: I Yeah.\nproject manager: although the whole concepts thing, the whole concepts phase, I don't think I really understood like the concept. Well the id okay the notion of \nmarketing: 'Cause it's such a functional item.\nproject manager: yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material, it's just it is what it is. You know,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea. And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: I dunno. But. All in all it's kinda interesting.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: So we have more slides or?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No just this closing one. No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget, but we could s you know do it \nmarketing: We got it to be.\nproject manager: We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\nmarketing: Like cutting corners. Kind of,\nproject manager: and \nmarketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product, not the project in general.\nproject manager: Mm. True.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing, at the time that just i made more sense, but I could see if they were really asking about us.\nproject manager: Yeah. 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it. Um. Yeah. And it's all recorded, woo-hoo. Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Yay.\nproject manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff, like because and if and so forth, but I'll put most of it in the reports.\nindustrial designer: I It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording.\nmarketing: Make it sound eloquent. Oh, I have to done I've {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nice.\nmarketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that\nproject manager: Oh yeah.\nmarketing: that mean nothing.\nproject manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that, psycholinguistics.\nindustrial designer: Really.\nuser interface: What the uhs and the \nmarketing: There's a guy studying it here, yeah, he's studying ums and ahs or something.\nindustrial designer: Filler words or?\nproject manager: Yep, they're called um disfluencies.\nindustrial designer: Disfluencies.\nmarketing: That's a good word for it.\nproject manager: Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Just add some prefixes, sounds classier.\nproject manager: Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents.\nindustrial designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot, just out of boredom,\nproject manager: Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah I know.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: I, yeah,\nindustrial designer: like c come on gimme something.\nmarketing: pretty compulsively during meetings, like, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Come on give me some information.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet, so I mean I do the \nmarketing: Yeah, we are addicts.\nuser interface: That's scary\nindustrial designer: It is scary.\nuser interface: yeah?\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are \nproject manager: I know, imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet. It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I mean, you know, it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time.\nmarketing: I yeah.\nuser interface: Dude, I think we've had internet for like eighteen years.\nmarketing: True.\nproject manager: No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous\nmarketing: I yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four, but still.\nindustrial designer: It's crazy. So \nmarketing: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: In the eighties?\nmarketing: My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: There's basically the fundamental structures, but it wasn't uh household to household yet\nuser interface: Right.\nmarketing: because it hadn't been\nuser interface: Yeah, it was to the like seven universities or something.\nmarketing: partitioned off and stuff, yeah that was him.\nuser interface: You guys ready to celebrate?\nproject manager: Yeah that's our last step. Celebration.\nmarketing: Apparently, does that include like champagne or something exciting? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Should.\nproject manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part.\nmarketing: I think so. I think that's a closer.\nproject manager: Cool.\nindustrial designer: Has it been forty minutes or whatever? this has been long enough.\nuser interface: Celebrate.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Where do you find that?\nmarketing: I have no idea.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Is that the only song you have?\nuser interface: There is another one. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Is this one of those media player?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Huh?\nproject manager: W oh.\nindustrial designer: That's awesome.\nuser interface: Yep. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The default track. I thought it was David Burns, look into the eyeball.\nindustrial designer: Maybe I have a different one.\nproject manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while, maybe this is the new version.\nmarketing: So is that a close?\nproject manager: Yeah, I guess we'll call that a a doner.\nmarketing: Okay, that's the end of the meeting.\nproject manager: Fab.\nmarketing: Thank you gentlemen.

{"fname": "product_dev_128", "dialogue": "marketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control, let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls, what they like, what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: because they are supposed to be useful. Don't forget about that. So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey. And next please. Yeah, so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls. First of all, they find it very ugly. Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour, not nice shape, I mean they're all the same, and they're not l good looking. Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control, so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um. And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls. For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another. And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used, so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using. Um next please. Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Agree.\nmarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please, where are you?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Like uh something to to like t I think phones. Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality. Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but you can't phone your your remote control.\nindustrial designer: You can you are .\nproject manager: Why not? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But why not? Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use,\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them, so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls. And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay uh tha that's look great.\nmarketing: So I think they are bad. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: R_S_I_ mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm nobody has any idea about that? Well I'll check uh with my\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect.\nmarketing: Oh, okay,\nuser interface: No, I don't think so.\nmarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: which our \nindustrial designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and those waves have high \nmarketing: So, it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But twenty six percent, do you know \nproject manager: Or something we don't know. Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nuser interface: Twenty five. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nmarketing: but we have to take this into account.\nuser interface: Every fourth, you know. Every four some of us knows.\nindustrial designer: Yeah it's People really \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: So anyway\nuser interface: One of us \nmarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: what else do I have? Next slide? Ah yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nuser interface: Functions.\nmarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session, but it is very relevant. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: People want to have a power button. Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury. We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nmarketing: I continue my presentation so yeah,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: channel selection is um very important, very often used. Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course. And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings. Audio settings, screen settings, even teletext and channel settings. All of them. they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant. It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant, even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least, so.\nproject manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext, that it's out of date now because of internet.\nmarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this, which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But but if you compare with these ones, uh I think they scored a one or two.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Not very relevant, so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful. For instance I think net next slide. One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control, so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want. So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age. Young people, probably because it's a buzz word, find it very relevant. And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control?\nindustrial designer: 'Cause \nmarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider. If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now\nproject manager: Mm-mm. Okay.\nmarketing: this is of course, depends on that. And um I don't have any conclusion, I didn't have time the meeting was very tight, so that's basically my findings. And uh, if you have any question?\nproject manager: Mm I think it's good, okay. You done a good review.\nuser interface: I got one question,\nmarketing: I can go back.\nindustrial designer: Thank you.\nmarketing: Yeah one question,\nuser interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nmarketing: yeah?\nuser interface: so\nmarketing: I am. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: should we aim at the young people or not?\nmarketing: I think we should aim at the young people. But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people, less than more than \nuser interface: Okay, then teletext is used less.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think,\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: yeah. Because they they have other means of finding their information. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm mm mm. Okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: That's good point.\nmarketing: But yeah. Nope.\nindustrial designer: Mm, yep.\nuser interface: Mm.

{"fname": "product_dev_127", "dialogue": "project manager: So\nmarketing: So \nproject manager: I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting.\nmarketing: Of course. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation. Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part uh I don't remember {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: which is not very good. Ah of course, how to to design this uh this \nmarketing: Nice stuff {vocalsound}\nproject manager: yeah. So um let's go for the three presentations, so first um Marketing Expert.\nmarketing: Who starts? Oh. Ha. okay.\nproject manager: So wait a minute. Mm.\nmarketing: So I dunno if I can do that like this? Yeah? So it's being modified. Do you want yeah, open. Read only. I hope I saved it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So, um\nuser interface: Sammy Benjo. I know this name uh.\nmarketing: yeah, this is my name. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Sounds uh \nuser interface: We met before.\nmarketing: So as you know, you I think you already know me, Sammy Benjo. I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls, and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly. So next please. Uh-oh. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm uh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it is put F_ five .\nproject manager: Hmm.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: The full page presentation, yep.\nmarketing: Yeah maybe in the full page\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: F_ F_ five.\nmarketing: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation, so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yep.\nproject manager: F_ five.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh-huh hmm okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm.\nmarketing: So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control, let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls, what they like, what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: because they are supposed to be useful. Don't forget about that. So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey. And next please. Yeah, so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls. First of all, they find it very ugly. Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour, not nice shape, I mean they're all the same, and they're not l good looking. Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control, so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um. And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls. For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another. And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used, so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using. Um next please. Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and they for instance uh they don't even find it {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Agree.\nmarketing: Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please, where are you?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Like uh something to to like t I think phones. Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality. Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but you can't phone your your remote control.\nindustrial designer: You can you are .\nproject manager: Why not? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But why not? Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use,\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: in fact they don't even know how to use them, so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls. And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay uh tha that's look great.\nmarketing: So I think they are bad. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: R_S_I_ mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Mm nobody has any idea about that? Well I'll check uh with my\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect.\nmarketing: Oh, okay,\nuser interface: No, I don't think so.\nmarketing: I think it's a technical thing\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: which our \nindustrial designer: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and those waves have high \nmarketing: So, it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But twenty six percent, do you know \nproject manager: Or something we don't know. Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nuser interface: Twenty five. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nmarketing: but we have to take this into account.\nuser interface: Every fourth, you know. Every four some of us knows.\nindustrial designer: Yeah it's People really \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: So anyway\nuser interface: One of us \nmarketing: that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: what else do I have? Next slide? Ah yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So we've listed a couple of uh\nuser interface: Functions.\nmarketing: s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session, but it is very relevant. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: People want to have a power button. Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: it's repetitivity stress injury. We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nmarketing: I continue my presentation so yeah,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: channel selection is um very important, very often used. Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course. And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings. Audio settings, screen settings, even teletext and channel settings. All of them. they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant. It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant, even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least, so.\nproject manager: I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext, that it's out of date now because of internet.\nmarketing: I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this, which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But but if you compare with these ones, uh I think they scored a one or two.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Not very relevant, so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful. For instance I think net next slide. One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control, so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want. So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age. Young people, probably because it's a buzz word, find it very relevant. And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control?\nindustrial designer: 'Cause \nmarketing: I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider. If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now\nproject manager: Mm-mm. Okay.\nmarketing: this is of course, depends on that. And um I don't have any conclusion, I didn't have time the meeting was very tight, so that's basically my findings. And uh, if you have any question?\nproject manager: Mm I think it's good, okay. You done a good review.\nuser interface: I got one question,\nmarketing: I can go back.\nindustrial designer: Thank you.\nmarketing: Yeah one question,\nuser interface: uh you are a Market Expert\nmarketing: yeah?\nuser interface: so\nmarketing: I am. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: should we aim at the young people or not?\nmarketing: I think we should aim at the young people. But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people, less than more than \nuser interface: Okay, then teletext is used less.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think,\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: yeah. Because they they have other means of finding their information. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm mm mm. Okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: That's good point.\nmarketing: But yeah. Nope.\nindustrial designer: Mm, yep.\nuser interface: Mm. Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Kay?\nindustrial designer: Thank you.\nproject manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure um \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Of the technical function, so uh\nmarketing: So I think it's you, huh?\nindustrial designer: Uh it's\nmarketing: No? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That's me.\nproject manager: what effect \nindustrial designer: techni function of \nmarketing: No, user requiremen\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. Wait a second.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Argh.\nindustrial designer: I have to do working design so uh\nproject manager: So you're \nuser interface: That's but this but number three, yes. Mm-hmm. So, my name is Mark Dwight, and um I am responsible for User Interface Design.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: However, uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design. Uh, as I'm a more an artist\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this.\nproject manager: Okay. Let's go.\nuser interface: So next slide please. And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor. We should never complicate things too much. We should only make a remote control, nothing more. Nothing more than this, just a remote control.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use.\nmarketing: Makes sense. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So, make a click, please. So here is this remote control.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's quite a standard one, but it's not from a T_V_, it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something. But you know, we can use it for a T_V_ easily. Only buttons we need is on off, volume, channels and maybe some options or something else, and please make a click, compared to this one\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's \nuser interface: which one would you prefer? I guess this.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button.\nuser interface: Sure, sure.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of like, between those two\nuser interface: Yeah, and our method is going to be, provide simple\nindustrial designer: li\nproject manager: Oh sorry. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: simple desires into simple actions.\nmarketing: Nice. Nice sentence.\nuser interface: Findings.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh sorry.\nuser interface: Our question of the style, we should remember that our company\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Concept.\nindustrial designer: S you should yeah.\nuser interface: Be simple. Be simple and you'll lean on this market.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Market is a of remote controls you know it better,\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: it's very well, it's it's not an easy field to to play, you know? So be simple.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's a really good style, it going to be look like like this. It is unbreakable and it is very universal. W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: and we can put all the options into this screen. We'll need only few buttons. All the other things can be controlled through the screen. And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click, 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something, you always try to find a good button and click it, but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch. So Press \nproject manager: \nuser interface: I would propose this concept for design, just few buttons, a screen with a back light which can change colours, titanium\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: I think, and uh what else? I got just very few and good ideas. We need power and volume. And let us include two nice features into this device, first, power on and off can be made fully automatic. When you go to the sofa, take your control and point it to the T_V_,\nproject manager: It's off.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: It's on.\nuser interface: the T_V_ turns on.\nmarketing: And when does it turn off?\nuser interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time\nmarketing: Oh so you have a\nuser interface: like uh you \nmarketing: sensing sensor machine that uh knows \nuser interface: It's a question to our technical design, our two engineers.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control. Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you. Like, you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something, and then the volume changes.\nproject manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's easy to do,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: you just control the \nmarketing: According to your distance to and the angle maybe, if you have a stereo system.\nindustrial designer: Distance.\nuser interface: According to the distance. Yeah yeah yeah. So \nmarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen, wha what is the use usefulness of the screen? Uh is it a touch screen by the way?\nuser interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left, right, up, down and enter.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow. \nuser interface: So, its main purpose in fact is a back light,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: which change colours,\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: which makes it easier to find, and each can it can respond for your voice, like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily, yeah?\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: So basically that's it.\nproject manager: Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control.\nuser interface: Can be easily done,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: 'cause you got simple designs, y we should put it to simple actions.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nuser interface: Let it be universal, so you want to use it for your hi-fi system. You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Just few actions, a few actions for everything.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Hmm. S\nuser interface: All the rest, we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen.\nproject manager: Mm. Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah.\nuser interface: Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Yeah and it mm.\nuser interface: Okay, but it's quite universal you know.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: We can just extend it to any device.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five, how would I do can I do that with this?\nuser interface: Uh twenty five.\nmarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now. You know these days we have hundreds of channels,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels.\nuser interface: In fact I would propose another solution.\nmarketing: Or is it?\nuser interface: Basically you use just four or five channels, right?\nmarketing: Most people \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one, two, three and five, and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel.\nmarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen, instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three, twenty eight, forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button.\nproject manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution, I think. Hmm.\nmarketing: I uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: B yeah.\nindustrial designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display, like you can uh de you can just button the number\nmarketing: Go to channel twenty five.\nindustrial designer: and then it go\nmarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap.\nindustrial designer: t because Yeah.\nmarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels, I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: But still Yeah.\nmarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do, zapping.\nproject manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: And it's only next.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah\nuser interface: Mm. We got these buttons here. Next next.\nmarketing: so but you have to \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah..\nuser interface: Or say this can be back.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five\nmarketing: So it would be \nindustrial designer: and then \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and you can change mode zapping mode or\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Alright.\nproject manager: uh current chan\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nmarketing: Listening more.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this, like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four?\nmarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Although I don't know. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Alright? Thanks for your attention.\nproject manager: Uh you're finish? Okay. So now the technical aspects of this new device. Mm.\nindustrial designer: Two. Yeah, if  Sorry.\nproject manager: You prefer it . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh as you know, I am mister Ramaro. I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators. So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control. Well, as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device, like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera. So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_. So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions, what we want on this portable device. And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface, which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that. And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device. It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information. Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want. So, basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want, and then we have some chip, it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format. And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device. Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations, and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things.\nproject manager: Okay. To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, because the people don't use one particular brand so\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: or at least we have more more than five brands, which are really good.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device. So we need to have particular encryption codes.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Then, components, so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device. Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components. And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard, or mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure, because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: we can have another, like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery, so this battery, once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\nproject manager: On \nindustrial designer: and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh train it, okay. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah, so that we just use simple recog\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Too complex.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: no but but \nmarketing: But uh very very good to sell. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. No, even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things, yeah.\nmarketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them,\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and ha ha you cannot use my remote control,\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: because it's targeted to me. Whatever. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: And what about the price of this component?\nindustrial designer: So Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that,\nproject manager: It mm okay.\nmarketing: Hmm. Cheap.\nindustrial designer: because we want to have uh millions and in bulk,\nmarketing: Millions. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so we can make really simp\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and we want to make really simple device\nmarketing: Cheap.\nindustrial designer: because we have only very few words like like power, switch on or some like\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel, so users can listen.\nmarketing: The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: or or it will be something like volume, up, down.\nindustrial designer: Ye No, yeah, a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: With a keywords and yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah volume and decrease or increase, so we try to only recognise those words\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm mm.\nindustrial designer: and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\nmarketing: Couple of words.\nindustrial designer: then it become more mechanical and yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Um.\nindustrial designer: And then we can have channel they can say, okay I want eight, because we don't know like users have different programmes, I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\nmarketing: Of course uh it has to be \nindustrial designer: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem,\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: it's it it will be take care of our main mm.\nuser interface: No you know it's a conceptual question, 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it, volume up, volume up,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But then I think you you {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and and he's coming you know, he's really annoyed with this, down, up, down. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons.\nproject manager: No, in no not only speech, yeah.\nmarketing: It's on top of using the button.\nproject manager: I it's an option.\nuser interface: Okay, for this budget like twelve Euros.\nmarketing: Well, I dunno. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on, on and off, this processor and This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power, volume and this part and this D_S_P_s.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Again, this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form, like volume and like this key.\nuser interface: Okay..\nindustrial designer: So it may not be like very expensive, because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control\nmarketing: T_V_.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so and we have only few things here \nproject manager: Sho to to train, okay.\nuser interface: Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Like, if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: roll 'em up\nindustrial designer: Um uh uh this point we didn't consider\nuser interface: or roll 'em down.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Very expensive,\nindustrial designer: because it's it's very expensive\nmarketing: no?\nindustrial designer: because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros\nproject manager: And well, what about the idea of automatic on off on the button, yeah.\nuser interface: Mm why?\nindustrial designer: and \nuser interface: That's just \nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: And volume control.\nindustrial designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic, because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\nmarketing: So but uh \nindustrial designer: and \nmarketing: Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control. We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yay yeah. Yeah that can be possible, especially for power settings, so user can say okay, suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I \nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: Wouldn't that make uh arguments?\nindustrial designer: They can make \nmarketing: Yeah, of course.\nproject manager: I want uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah we can have \nmarketing: That's no problem, we will sell more. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And we can increase this the strength\nuser interface: We got a really good Market Expert.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah exactly.\nproject manager: y you can buy one with {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Let's send more, let's sell more.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay. You have mm something else to say? Uh.\nindustrial designer: Uh, not very much,\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: like yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. Thanks.\nproject manager: Okay, thanks.\nindustrial designer: Thank you. Yep. Thank you.\nproject manager: So\nindustrial designer: Can you just yeah.\nproject manager: mm\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: mm I think, okay, we're just on time. Um mm mm. So, we're now going to l have the lunch break.\nmarketing: Mm great. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work, and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting, and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so uh you will focus on the component concept um\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah.\nproject manager: uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\nindustrial designer: Mark will \nproject manager: and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching. So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach. Well I think that's all. And we have um maybe we have to we say, only for T_V_, not teletext?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible.\nindustrial designer: Uh it's in current price, yeah.\nmarketing: Difficult.\nproject manager: Yeah, maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But speech recogniser can be possible.\nproject manager: Yeah, implemented. O okay, we can think about that.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: And um do you see something else?\nmarketing: No.\nuser interface: Uh, should it be equipped with the uh, with uh speakers?\nmarketing: Speakers in the remote cont\nuser interface: Like, you want to find it, you shout\nmarketing: Oh yeah.\nproject manager: Uh yeah\nuser interface: control,\nproject manager: that's \nuser interface: and it answers is I'm here? Or \nmarketing: It just beeps.\nuser interface: Just beeps?\nmarketing: That would be enough.\nproject manager: Or maybe you want to phone him.\nmarketing: Something very cheap.\nproject manager: Since now all \nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah.\nmarketing: But that's ex that's expensive. Uh.\nproject manager: yeah? Think\nindustrial designer: Yeah, especially the power, it really consumes\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: because it should be all the time on and \nproject manager: And uh \nmarketing: Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they \nproject manager: And it's answered.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: because of the the frequency they they just answer to that.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: I can't whistle. No, no, I can't.\nmarketing: You can't whistle. Uh-huh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Or a clap. You can clap. Can you?\nproject manager: Clap clap clap it's a good \nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Clap is good.\nproject manager: I I think it's universal.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Tak\nproject manager: What about people without hand?\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Just a suggestion.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think it's good.\nproject manager: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: With only one hand? These are not our target people. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm uh okay.\nindustrial designer: But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nuser interface: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: Oh that's e that already exists\nuser interface: Yeah, I got it at my home, like .\nmarketing: okay okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Oh yeah, you do have.\nuser interface: Oops.\nindustrial designer: Ah it's {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Wow. You're trendy. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm, so let's to think s so that \nmarketing: Think about it.\nproject manager: yeah. I think that could be in the component uh concept uh.\nmarketing: Yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It yes. Okay.\nmarketing: Okay.

Тоді дизайнер інтерфейсу користувача наголосив, що вони розробляють не що інше, як пульт дистанційного керування, оскільки їхній принцип полягає у перетворенні простих бажань користувачів у прості дії. Тому запропонована концепція дизайну включала лише кілька кнопок, екран із підсвіткою і титан, одобрений групою. Нарешті, коли мова зайшла про робочу конструкцію пульта дистанційного керування, промисловий дизайнер описав продукт як портативний пристрій з джерелом енергії, інтерфейсом, процесором, джерелом інфрачервоного випромінювання, різними кодами шифрування для різних телевізорів і розпізнавачем мови.

This is it.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Well, I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um to start with these points. Uh next sheet? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls, because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things. Uh, furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use. Um then I tell something about um the most important issues. So we have to focus on those three thing three things. And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users, customers. Well, um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's seventy five per cent of the current users. They don't like it, so we might think about fronts in that section. Um They also say, that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent, uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls. So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control. Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions. Uh, almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity. So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy. Furthermore, it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot. Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle, so you can reach it with your thumb.\nindustrial designer: You can zap away. Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right. A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television, that's your um your control beeps or something, that you can find this very easily.\nproject manager: Well {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I dunno, maybe that's an idea.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control, within the same room.\nindustrial designer: Oh?\nproject manager: It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: because it can also be used for other televisions. So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television, that bleeps to your remote control, everyone can use it.\nmarketing: Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device?\nproject manager: No you can click it on your television.\nmarketing: Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something?\nproject manager: Yeah in another room, yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well yes.\nmarketing: Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So Well a beeping device would be \nproject manager: Well we'll have a look at it, yeah.\nmarketing: Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem. Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn. So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote, of course. Uh \nmarketing: Yeah but people don't read manuals.\nindustrial designer: I didn't read it?\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Oh, alright.\nmarketing: No.\nindustrial designer: users to uh add one? Do you think?\nuser interface: I don't think \nmarketing: I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use, than a manual.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah alright. Because they don't use it? Alright.\nproject manager: Well there sh should always be a menu,\nmarketing: Yeah. Right.\nproject manager: but it c can be very short.\nmarketing: And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes.\nuser interface: Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control, I think.\nproject manager: Yes okay.\nindustrial designer: Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it?\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Yeah right. It sh it should be there, the manual. But but not to explain how the remote works. Only \nmarketing: And we don't have much time. So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design. So you can pick up and use it, than I think.\nproject manager: Well we are a design team,\nuser interface: Hmm.\nproject manager: we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point.\nindustrial designer: Isn't it part of the of the u\nmarketing: Yeah right, right.\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No. No. Never mind.\nproject manager: Well we'll have a look. Um yes?\nmarketing: Next point. Um R_S_I_.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well that's about twenty per cent I thought. But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat? Yeah, consider the consequences of using your remote.\nindustrial designer: Consider the m Yeah.\nmarketing: It should be a good in your hand. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: Right, this is the most important part. Um, we're Like the requirements said, we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience. Um, that's about sixty per cent of the market, so it's uh quite important. Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device. Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty, ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that.\nproject manager: Well \nmarketing: So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs.\nproject manager: Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost, we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh \nindustrial designer: It's going to be expensive. Yeah.\nuser interface: No.\nmarketing: Yeah but they think it's really important.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of uh of the stuff, maybe we can uh buy it very cheap, I dunno. We have to uh \nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: Well we'll uh consider it uh.\nproject manager: Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh \nindustrial designer: We'll think abo we'll think \nmarketing: Yeah, I don't know. I don't have any information on that. So {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Nigh\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I know. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No, we'll look we'll look into that later. Alright?\nmarketing: Right. And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition. They also like that,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but research is very uh costly. So \nuser interface: I think that's uh difficult to realise also.\nmarketing: Yeah, but it it might be important for the sale.\nindustrial designer: We have very demanding clients.\nproject manager: It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so \nuser interface: No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think.\nproject manager: We sh\nmarketing: Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition.\nproject manager: Yeah absolutely.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: So we might consider L_C_D_ screens.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah, alright. Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find, I think.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: We don't rule them out uh yet.\nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Alright. Um, I think that's it. Um \nproject manager: Alright.\nmarketing: I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: So you can Right.\nproject manager: Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation.\nmarketing: Yeah. Right.\nproject manager: It's in the Well uh next um I dunno who is next.\nuser interface: Oh you go.\nindustrial designer: Shall I give a technical talk?\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: Well go ahead. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design.\nproject manager: Yip.\nindustrial designer: We have that here. Okay, how do you enlarge it, so that you can have the \nproject manager: F_ five.\nindustrial designer: F_ F_ five.\nproject manager: F_ five.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well, the working design,\nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: that's my uh \nmarketing: Next button. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well alright uh, you know who I am and what I do. So uh we have this. It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something. It was originally in black and white\nmarketing: Oh right.\nindustrial designer: but it became black and purple.\nmarketing: Purple.\nindustrial designer: But I think you can read it.\nuser interface: \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah. A bit.\nindustrial designer: Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control. Uh well you can see uh \nmarketing: Maybe you can select it. So it uh inverts.\nindustrial designer: And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page.\nmarketing: the p the whole picture.\nproject manager: Click. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nah, uh never mind.\nindustrial designer: Well, you can read it,\nuser interface: Yeah, go ahead.\nindustrial designer: it's not too difficult. Meanwhile, this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works. You have uh basically uh the energy, the power of the of the remote control, uh and the sender, w which is the LED, the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the, no, to the set.\nmarketing: Yeah. Alright.\nindustrial designer: And uh the source is of course the user. Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip, and the chip uh sends it to the LED, and the LED sends it to the receiver. That's the that's the basic idea.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Very basic.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key. It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed. The key a signal to a chip, uh the chip senses the connection. uh and recognise the key. So well you understand.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: The chip uh produces Morse code, um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed, of course. And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED, which is the bulb, of course.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the, well it's uh very simple, and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal, and performs the assigned task.\nproject manager: So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that. And a button for T_V_. So \nindustrial designer: Ah bu Yeah, but we don't. Uh we {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No no, but Yeah. Exactly. Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I've some couple of pictures here. It's a very basic one. And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it, it uh won't look anything like this, but This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control. It has uh very little buttons and \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah, you can easily recognise the buttons. They're uh far enough apart and an anything. It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh\nuser interface: High tech. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: indeed, and it's not very user-friendly. Uh if you look at the shape, it's uh just a simple long box uh shape. So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that, uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly, and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur.\nmarketing: Right. Can I say something?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons. Uh the power button is used very much, channel selection, volume and teletext. Well teletext is not an option, so that uh \nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: But I think it's very important to make um the power, channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb, so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately \nmarketing: Right. Make them big, make them easy to uh to press.\nproject manager: Well but but {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You can also like \nindustrial designer: You don't have to look and and search for them.\nproject manager: if you have um the most used buttons all in one place, and you keep making the same um well moves.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Yeah, I was thinking you can {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, right. Right.\nproject manager: But if y if you would put it at a different place, then you have to move your hands,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and that's on of the things about R_S_I_.\nuser interface: Are some of the the the um \nmarketing: Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right.\nindustrial designer: Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb, of course.\nmarketing: We\nproject manager: No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_.\nmarketing: But Yeah. That's very important. And \nuser interface: Maybe you can make, for for channel changing, two little buttons on the side of the remote, so you can just do like this. Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some\nproject manager: Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons.\nmarketing: But is that is that useable?\nuser interface: Hmm?\nmarketing: Do people, uh when they pick up a remote, know that they have to do that?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well \nmarketing: It's a f it's a new feature,\nproject manager: Well it it's \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it.\nuser interface: Yeah alright, but \nproject manager: Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote \nuser interface: Yeah, but if you s say them up and down, they they'll understand it , I think.\nproject manager: Yeah. If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote, and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel.\nuser interface: Eighty per cent would.\nindustrial designer: Well, .\nmarketing: Yeah, he feels it immediately.\nproject manager: That's very irritating, I think.\nuser interface: Yeah that's true.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's right. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah but {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right, continue.\nindustrial designer: But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed, and as you say at the thumb.\nmarketing: Sorry. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think that's a good idea, and uh and that the less important uh buttons, like the the the different channels, uh the numbers one two three four five as well, should be uh yeah well not in reach, because uh they don't use it uh all the time. Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: And I have some pictures of the inside workings, but uh I don't want to get too technical,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you.\nproject manager: That's your part of the job. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, that's right.\nindustrial designer: So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: And uh well that's about it I think. Oh yeah, I still have this. Oh I had to delete this, but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new \nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: But I had too too little time,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but uh don't uh don't look at it please.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well we understand.\nindustrial designer: I I think it's it's clear uh how it works.\nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: We understand.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's clear.\nproject manager: Oh right, no.\nindustrial designer: Alright. That's the most important thing.\nproject manager: Nice. Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation.\nindustrial designer: Alright. Uh \nproject manager: How late is did we start his presentation uh? \nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: I dunno. I think uh w About twenty minutes ago?\nproject manager: Wha Yeah.\nmarketing: Losing time losing time. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well then we have still the time, so But we do have to come to a decision, right later on.\nmarketing: Yeah right. So \nproject manager: So \nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: \nuser interface: Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing, but obviously that's not the case.\nmarketing: I don't think so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages, with different links.\nproject manager: Oh yeah?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nproject manager: Uh?\nuser interface: For instance you couldn't see this. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, yeah well.\nuser interface: Um Yeah. Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: The the method? Well I used my own experience with remotes, took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website, which are these two.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: These are already in use?\nuser interface: Yes, these are from from another uh manufacturer.\nmarketing: Alright, okay.\nuser interface: Um This one is engineering-centred, so this one has the most functions and um things.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: Well \nproject manager: I like user-centred.\nmarketing: Yeah, me too.\nuser interface: I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best.\nproject manager: Yeah. We also do that.\nuser interface: Um Well, I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also, and teletext and that kind of stuff.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one.\nmarketing: But we have to reject that, because of the requirements?\nuser interface: But Yes.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Um I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need.\nmarketing: Yeah, right.\nuser interface: I um I kinda like the shape. I think this is what we talked about. But \nindustrial designer: You can't really see uh the differ from different sides.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But I think uh \nuser interface: No I've Well I showed it somewhere. Um \nindustrial designer: Uh you can draw it if you Yeah.\nuser interface: Oh yeah. I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So we can can uh yeah customise the \nproject manager: Well absolutely, but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company. So we cannot just uh make someone w\nuser interface: Mm? Yeah. It's a front. It's not the the whole remote that changes, of course.\nproject manager: No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front.\nuser interface: You can \nmarketing: But it \nproject manager: So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it, then uh our recognition is totally gone.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's right\nuser interface: Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote.\nmarketing: Yeah, that's a must.\nuser interface: So l like Ericsson does every uh \nproject manager: Yeah, we must.\nindustrial designer: We can put it on the on the back side.\nmarketing: We must have that.\nproject manager: Yeah well and and \nuser interface: S something like this. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: It's recognisable.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nuser interface: Um \nmarketing: We can make a symbol of the company right here. And if you put a front on it, there's a hole on the front. So the symbol's always on\nuser interface: Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so that you don't replace the symbol, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah yeah yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah. Something like that,\nproject manager: Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front.\nuser interface: in the Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Those kind of things.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: But let's not focus on the front . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. Okay.\nuser interface: Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function. If we we had to include more functions. But we don't. So um \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah. I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need.\nmarketing: Alright.\nuser interface: Maybe some less. Like eject we don't need, and some other buttons we don't need. I think uh \nindustrial designer: Mike, uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file? In Map?\nuser interface: Yeah, I will. I think uh for the remote um uh less is more. The less buttons the better the design. Um \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: We should go with that concept I think.\nmarketing: Yeah, I agree.\nuser interface: I know.\nproject manager: Alright.\nmarketing: I've I've got another point.\nproject manager: Yeah?\nmarketing: Um there are two target audi audiences, and we've uh chose for the younger one.\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Um, research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features. They are high high interested in feature. But they are more critical. Fo Yeah, critical.\nindustrial designer: The younger uh \nmarketing: So The younger audience.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people.\nproject manager: Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top, and the bottom side of the front has a little clip,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh \nmarketing: Clip aren't used much.\nproject manager: Well but because you say they their features are important, they want m um a lot,\nindustrial designer: No um mm usually \nmarketing: Yeah right.\nindustrial designer: But \nproject manager: but not \nuser interface: Yeah, but what kind of features? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition.\nindustrial designer: Yeah I think m most \nmarketing: Yeah but Yeah.\nuser interface: But I've \nindustrial designer: Most uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Here, look at these numbers. The newest features are, like I said, are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control. Our audience, these people, are very like these uh features.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm. Uh.\nmarketing: You see? So we must build in something, or they will to uh go to the concurrent.\nproject manager: Competitors. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Our competitor. Yeah.\nmarketing: The concurrent? Competitors, right.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So, I do think we have to uh have some features.\nproject manager: Yeah. Well maybe w we could uh s\nmarketing: Even though they cost a little more.\nproject manager: On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something,\nmarketing: Right. Right.\nproject manager: or that you can click uh out uh of the remote. And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information.\nmarketing: Like a ticker-tape.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Which programme you are l watching or something.\nuser interface: Yeah, that's nice. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Those kind of things, uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s. And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also, you they can display which programme you're currently watching.\nmarketing: Yeah, right. Yeah right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah. So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: For example. It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it.\nuser interface: Yeah, we should keep that simple too.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: It will {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But should it uh really be uh clickable, uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well maybe.\nmarketing: No not clickable.\nuser interface: No, it should be uh integrated.\nindustrial designer: or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nah, no no no.\nuser interface: I think {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, just at at the top. So when you s you sit like this you can can watch.\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nmarketing: I think it should be at the top.\nuser interface: something like on um some radios in car. You Where it's, yeah, walking to Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah right. It's a ticker-tape idea.\nproject manager: R_D_S_s or something.\nindustrial designer: But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design, with the scrolling text and that kind of thing.\nuser interface: Wa Yeah.\nproject manager: Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling,\nmarketing: Well it's just one script. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh \nmarketing: Yeah, five minutes of ja ja for programming.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So I don't think that's the issue.\nproject manager: No.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Alright, we go with the L_C_D_ screen?\nproject manager: Uh well I think so, yes. Um \nuser interface: Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost.\nmarketing: 'Kay. Right, I don't know if I can find that, but \nproject manager: We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that.\nuser interface: Or maybe you will get that information uh \nproject manager: Um we can use this board again, I think.\nmarketing: Next time. Yeah right.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want, th the issue. Where is my presentation? Uh \nmarketing: Yeah, I understand what you're saying.\nproject manager: Uh \nmarketing: We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look.\nproject manager: Well I mean we're all here now, I think. These I've already given you. So we have to decide on the different remote control functions. So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special.\nmarketing: Right. At the top.\nindustrial designer: Shouldn't we start with the most important parts?\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: At the top or at the bottom?\nindustrial designer: The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button?\nmarketing: I think the top is more uh \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh \nuser interface: Yeah but \nmarketing: When you s How do you zap?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You just sit in your chair?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Huh?\nuser interface: Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural.\nmarketing: With the remote?\nproject manager: That thing is terrible.\nuser interface: 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be.\nproject manager: Uh \nuser interface: Yeah, no Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, I dunno.\nindustrial designer: And then uh \nmarketing: We'll draw two, and then we'll see uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here. I dunno what uh you were talking about but \nmarketing: No {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: we are busy with something .\nmarketing: Um he thinks Yeah, right. He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom, and I think it's better at the top.\nproject manager: Well \nindustrial designer: Uh-huh. Why do you think it's better at the bottom?\nuser interface: Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom, and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody.\nmarketing: But your \nuser interface: I c\nindustrial designer: But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down, so that there's room for the for the interface.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Well I d I think that's that's ugly but \nmarketing: The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small. It's it's wide.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: It's not not high. But \nproject manager: Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point,\nuser interface: I th\nindustrial designer: And and we can {vocalsound}\nproject manager: because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom.\nuser interface: Yeah. Power button always Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Bottom.\nproject manager: So and and I I like to use the ones on the top.\nuser interface: Yeah, y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah.\nproject manager: So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window \nmarketing: Yeah right. But We're making a remote with with a few functions you know.\nindustrial designer: Well that's a bit exaggerated. Well, I agree with you . It's it's also more recognisable.\nmarketing: We\nindustrial designer: It looks more like a calculator to people, if you have the l the the the thing on top. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes but we we we we don't want that.\nuser interface: Yeah you don't want \nproject manager: We don't want them to look like a calculator.\nuser interface: You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote.\nproject manager: We want to look it like our original but familiar \nindustrial designer: Yeah w well,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away,\nmarketing: High-tech . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yea\nindustrial designer: uh because I think it's uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I think it's still important to have it at the top,\nmarketing: Width.\nproject manager: Width. Uh format yeah format? Line width? Width?\nindustrial designer: because it's uh it's more familiar that way.\nmarketing: Th that's not a problem.\nproject manager: Yeah?\nmarketing: When I draw here it\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh. Huh?\nproject manager: It's a bit off.\nmarketing: Yeah, it's off.\nproject manager: Well. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: A little a little bit.\nmarketing: It it needs to be calibrated again. Well \nproject manager: Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe you should another pen.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe that's uh better. You e you only have one pen for that screen. Yeah.\nmarketing: Where?\nproject manager: It's special pen.\nmarketing: Alright, we have to make a decision now,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: because we don't have much time. Um \nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: I think we have uh a few functions, and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it, and still have lots of room at the bottom, where you can put your hand.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I I agree.\nproject manager: I think it should be at the button, bottom. Bottom. The L_C_D_.\nuser interface: At the bottom?\nindustrial designer: Well I'm the I I'm the designer, so um {vocalsound}\nuser interface: In a few minutes \nmarketing: At the bot\nuser interface: Oh yeah, oh yeah, I totally agree. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: So We are two uh V_S_ two. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions,\nuser interface: He's the boss. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and then look at the design.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right. Great.\nindustrial designer: Uh we uh we were busy with that.\nproject manager: Because we have to decide this.\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So, we have the power button.\nmarketing: And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: It's uh your it's your job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well we have a power button.\nindustrial designer: Yeah of course. Uh it's uh. Yeah. W wh\nuser interface: No it's our job.\nproject manager: Guys?\nuser interface: For all of us I think. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: While you have to agree, I can say it's like this and you must agree. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, right.\nproject manager: Guys?\nmarketing: Alright, let's keep it central.\nproject manager: We have a power button, setting buttons, L_C_D_ window, the number buttons \nuser interface: The ten numbers? Yeah?\nindustrial designer: Channel, yeah.\nproject manager: Uh \nuser interface: Volume?\nindustrial designer: Volume control.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: Um \nproject manager: Uh the mute button.\nindustrial designer: Well let's look at your uh design. Uh \nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: I h love that one.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button? Yeah, in circle, you know?\nproject manager: Yes. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Well that's that's also design.\nuser interface: And and a volume control also in it.\nproject manager: Yes. Um {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well h ho\nindustrial designer: But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else, a D_V_D_ player or something. So \nproject manager: Yes. Yes. They are for some uh video uh \nuser interface: Yes, as I already said, we could drop some of these buttons. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You should put that uh power button, channel and volume should have the most uh importance.\nuser interface: Yeah. I think these should be in one big circle in the middle.\nmarketing: Yeah, but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true. When when you uh put them all in the same place, the most used buttons, you're doing the same thing all the time,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about. So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other.\nproject manager: Apart. So people have to move their hand. And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand.\nproject manager: That's what I always do,\nindustrial designer: Y \nproject manager: because all my i important buttons are the same place.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. It's good to move uh from time to time. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yes?\nuser interface: Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place.\nmarketing: Um \nproject manager: Well not \nuser interface: They they need to be centred.\nindustrial designer: No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle?\nmarketing: Frequency of uh button use.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour. You can see.\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: Volume hardly.\nmarketing: So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart, I think, up and down.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: No I don't think.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nproject manager: Up and down far apart from each other?\nindustrial designer: Far apart?\nmarketing: You thinking uh about R_S_I_?\nuser interface: Yeah but \nproject manager: Well not too much. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah but \nmarketing: Y look at uh look at the frequency.\nuser interface: No. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nei not too much, but \nuser interface: The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important. So \nindustrial designer: I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together, but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together.\nproject manager: Well for example the power button, you can \nuser interface: Well they are used four times an hour, so \nproject manager: If someone is constantly z zapping, it's not going to miss, that it that the power button is not right beside it. Because I have someone But the buttons is way.\nmarketing: Nei nei nei n I I totally agree.\nproject manager: So that one can be put away.\nmarketing: But just Yeah. Right. Yeah. I agree.\nproject manager: The power button can uh be uh uh \nuser interface: Power bu button should be left at the top. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: And should and should be red.\nproject manager: Oh man,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: five minutes. Yeah, well five minutes left.\nmarketing: Right, just make some decisions.\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: The most important things we have to uh \nproject manager: Um how are we going to do it with those numbers?\nindustrial designer: C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now, I think. Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing.\nproject manager: Well I have it here. Yeah well that's going to take too too much time.\nmarketing: I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Mm. Yeah.\nmarketing: Just uh you decide that, you decide that,\nindustrial designer: Mm. Alright.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: and ready.\nproject manager: Well the L_C_D_. Um you are Industrial, you are User Interface. So I think it's going to go to Mike. But you will have to make consensus with .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Well \nuser interface: Well consensus, um We we can put it in the middle, so \nproject manager: Well it's a bit hard, because we are going to be uh individually.\nmarketing: Nei. We're No {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's a bit uh \nmarketing: We're deciding now, so \nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: Top or bottom?\nindustrial designer: Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top, so\nproject manager: Yes it is.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. You say familiarity isn't important but {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions, and the design comes into the next round? Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh?\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah d Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, right. Okay.\nproject manager: Alright these functions.\nuser interface: Alright.\nindustrial designer: As we we we we agreed, we do have a L_C_D_.\nproject manager: The number f Well yes, that's alright.\nindustrial designer: So that's that's enough. Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: W the number function. Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital?\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: How do you want it to do then?\nuser interface: Well just when you push a one one and \nindustrial designer: There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero.\nproject manager: It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more.\nuser interface: No, if you On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other, d it \nindustrial designer: Oh, like that. Um \nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: They'd recognise it.\nproject manager: Alright so no button for that.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Th that's the most \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: That that's very easy. Yeah.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote?\nindustrial designer: I think these are the the most important functions.\nmarketing: Do you still have the pictures over there?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Yeah, that's about it. You do need the uh multi Or did uh No, like this one. You do need them?\nproject manager: No, we'd uh just said we didn't uh \nmarketing: Yeah, I know.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But are we \nproject manager: Well uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Alright, alright uh Now okay.\nproject manager: Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes, all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant. So just for a television is that all we need?\nmarketing: Right. Yeah, it's most useable this way.\nindustrial designer: basic function.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Teletext is gone. So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh there's um screen. You can make it wider and less wide.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video.\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah.\nmarketing: I do think we have to put that underneath a clip.\nproject manager: Those two? But it's just two, and we make a clip?\nindustrial designer: Uh just two just two under uh under uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Th that's a bit uh waste.\nuser interface: We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here.\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: Yeah. Okay, right.\nproject manager: Or at the top. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I I think uh \nproject manager: Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Or at \nindustrial designer: But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section.\nuser interface: Yeah alright then.\nindustrial designer: Uh that's that's too complicated.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: You can just put it somewhere\nproject manager: Yeah\nindustrial designer: They they aren't used much, not as much as those other, so you can put it somewhere \nuser interface: Oh, they can be small or round like buttons.\nindustrial designer: Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom. Yeah. Yeah or at the top, yeah. What do you think uh those those buttons?\nproject manager: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote.\nindustrial designer: Above or down? And w where? Well we design it later. We have it, and we design later where everything goes. Yeah.\nproject manager: Yes? Yes. Yes. Well any other uh \nmarketing: Well if you you take those th If you \nuser interface: Why go to video?\nproject manager: Go to video, that's always on your remote control. To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_.\nmarketing: Yeah, but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh \nindustrial designer: The the video channel uh?\nuser interface: That's just zero. Yeah.\nproject manager: Well l n no not at not at my remote.\nindustrial designer: No no not always. Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but you can can zap down {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_.\nproject manager: Yes. I don't.\nuser interface: Yes, I think th\nproject manager: I go to ninety-nine. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No, then you press ninety nine.\nmarketing: Ah uh well whatever,.\nuser interface: I think go to video is an irrelevant button, but \nproject manager: Th that's the button uh No.\nindustrial designer: But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel, you do you have to push a to to get below zero.\nproject manager: No you can ch push zero. Yeah. Yeah,\nindustrial designer: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button.\nproject manager: I I think that one button is uh I use it uh \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons, you have to have uh channel setting, if you wa if you have a new T_V_. You have to set the channels.\nproject manager: Yeah?\nmarketing: Right all th these uh different buttons you have to \nproject manager: These buttons, I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote.\nindustrial designer: Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah, sk {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah, I do. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down, uh those \nuser interface: Yeah well y you must have.\nindustrial designer: Yeah y you you you you have screen width.\nuser interface: Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh \nmarketing: Right. That's the only one we put uh in there.\nproject manager: So we still have one uh four?\nmarketing: For a screen uh fu uh channel setting.\nproject manager: Ch ch\nindustrial designer: Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah.\nmarketing: Programme, right.\nproject manager: Okay. Oh the Okay button? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh \nproject manager: Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button, for your menu.\nuser interface: Yeah, alright.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Menu button.\nindustrial designer: You should Yeah. I think that's important.\nproject manager: Channel, setting, menu.\nindustrial designer: Uh  And and the settings to change the brightness {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We have to go. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: the settings to change the brightness and the contrast.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Channel, yeah.\nproject manager: So um Save.\nmarketing: \nindustrial designer: Chief? Chief?\nproject manager: Yes see.\nindustrial designer: Th the menu menu button is also important.\nproject manager: Yes I have put it in.\nindustrial designer: Then you can uh Where? I don't see it.\nproject manager: Here.\nindustrial designer: Oh Menu, alright.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu, yeah.\nindustrial designer: In the menu. And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something.\nuser interface: Yeah, the \nproject manager: Alright.\nindustrial designer: Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu.\nuser interface: Or the volume or something like that.\nproject manager: Guys?\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Or the volume, yeah.\nproject manager: We're going to uh go to our uh rooms, and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think. So \nuser interface: Your pen.\nmarketing: Ah. Great.\nindustrial designer: Yes chief.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Alright.\nproject manager: Well see you uh \nuser interface: I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now, or not?\nproject manager: W w we have lunchtime, by the way, now uh so uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah this is this is your thing.\nuser interface: Yeah, lunch break.\nmarketing: Ah. Okay. \nindustrial designer: I am hungry. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Lunch.\nmarketing: Get into my belly. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah.

Okay.\nproject manager: I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able\nmarketing: W yeah.\nproject manager: isn't it.

The prototype.\nindustrial designer: Huh?\nuser interface: Yes, well uh this is it. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: This is it.\nproject manager: Well, thank you. Uh, now \nuser interface: It's uh it's uh it's yellow. And uh, this is rubber. And and and this too. The\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: the sides.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: And the rest is hard plastic. And uh We uh we had some uh We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And then it covers the these buttons\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: until here or something.\nmarketing: Yes.\nuser interface: And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So, you can still operate uh all the things. Because you don't always use the menu. And then it can break.\nproject manager: Okay. And the buttons?\nuser interface: Uh, well uh \nindustrial designer: Big. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Big buttons. And everything is blue, except the power button. And the mute. Of uh yeah, and the mute and the the other button. Yeah.

Yes,\nindustrial designer: Yes.\nuser interface: that's uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Very obvious.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Up is channel up.

What's the R_R_ d {vocalsound}\nuser interface: R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo.\nindustrial designer: The R_R_?\nproject manager: Okay. Very good.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, we have \nmarketing: That's on the rub rubber part.\nuser interface: Uh, yes. Yes. That's about here.\nproject manager: So, what they say on the side is put fashion there. Yes. It's good.\nuser interface: Oh.\nproject manager: So, that's it. That's prototype.\nmarketing: Yeah?\nproject manager: Now, the finance. We don't know if it's th it if it's okay.\nmarketing: Alright. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, I'm gonna look.\nmarketing: Do we \nproject manager: We have \nmarketing: Do we change the \nproject manager: Sorry?\nmarketing: Do we change the the order? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first?\nproject manager: Finance is um Yeah it's No, first uh Yes. We have to evaluate the product yet.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Sorry.\nmarketing: That's uh um  That can be none. Um, we gonna do the evaluation now, together. But I have uh a introduction how it works. So, it will come up. Uh-oh. Okay. Um, yeah. Well, we uh uh, I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias, uh based on um our marketing strategy, on uh the latest trends, on user preferences. Uh, we have a seven point scale from uh true, as well. To false, seven? And on base of each c uh criteria, we need to um give a rating. We can uh Well, it look like this. But we gonna uh do it here, they said. So, you hope found out how to do it with a Word document. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Um, well uh we have the Word document\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Criteria.\nmarketing: You  So we open up that blank here. Um Think I can Uh, what this just an example. So, this not very important. But um, if I can get a number in here. Hmm.\nproject manager: No, it's okay.\nmarketing: Well, uh we can't do that.\nindustrial designer: I'll get it.\nproject manager: Oh, it's okay.\nmarketing: Um, so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative. Uh, and then we have to uh agree on the rating together. And in the end, we will c uh count an average of all rating. The first uh on each item.\nproject manager: What do you think?\nmarketing: Yeah, I think it's uh Uh, well technologically using, it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features. Only the L_C_D_. So, it Um, I think I will give it a yeah, yeah, yeah , a four. Hmm.\nindustrial designer: I think the scroll-button is something also uh new. What uh not anoth uh,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have. I think technologically I'll give it an seven. Si six six.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Sorry, six.\nmarketing: So now i I think you uh see it um its statement.\nindustrial designer: Oh, true or false.\nmarketing: And you true or false.\nindustrial designer: Oh, uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two.\nmarketing: And true is one. So, yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Two.\nindustrial designer: Sorry.\nproject manager: You?\nuser interface: Three.\nproject manager: Me too. So it's a three.\nmarketing: 'Kay. Um, well It's a one. The first item. So, okay the second item. Um, this product is for all sorts of customers.\nuser interface: Mm \nmarketing: Well, it's a statement which uh I disagree with, because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow, it's not uh really aimed for all customers. It doesn't look like that.\nproject manager: So it's a \nmarketing: That's uh a six.\nindustrial designer: Five.\nuser interface: Mm, four.\nproject manager: Yes, it's for the younger g group. So it's uh half half of the people.\nuser interface: Yeah, but it's it's \nproject manager: So I think it's four.\nuser interface: Yeah. I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons.\nproject manager: No.\nuser interface: So I mean, the colours are for young people,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: but\nproject manager: Yes. So, I think it's four.\nuser interface: older \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Maybe.\nproject manager: Okay. Give it a four.\nindustrial designer: Four.\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: Four. Uh, okay. Mm.\nproject manager: We put the fashion in electronics.\nmarketing: That's uh the motto of our company. Yeah, well do we do this with uh this product? I um Yeah. I think if we do this, as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design. Um, so I would give it a two.\nindustrial designer: Me too a two, because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard. But the rest of it is. So, I think a two.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yes. Two.\nproject manager: Uh, I say uh a five.\nmarketing: Two.\nproject manager: It's not fashion, it's new. It must be a fashion. But it isn't.\nindustrial designer: It it will be fashion.\nproject manager: Yes. It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it. So, it must be a fashion. I think it's a five.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh Okay.\nuser interface: Then make it th three.\nmarketing: Okay. Yes, I'll think of that too.\nproject manager: No. Oh.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay. Three is okay.\nmarketing: Yeah, agree?\nproject manager: I use my feet though. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh, we'll wait outside.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: A three.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The next element um is the product looks good. Well personally, I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow. So, I would give this a five.\nindustrial designer: I give it a one. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: . Yes, a one. I like it.\nproject manager: Well, I say three. So, counting then is two and a half. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We have to do our uh \nindustrial designer: Say two.\nmarketing: Two or three?\nproject manager: Okay, two.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: Two. Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So, well we gonna do the next part. Uh, yep. Uh uh, the next statement. It has not too much buttons. Um, yeah, I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better. And in the end we calculate an average. So, um that's why it's a negative in it. Um, well this one of our aims not have too much buttons. So, um uh did we uh do that? Well, uh if we go to uh this fashion, I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers. But you can you can go for that. And um that way, you don't have a lot of buttons over. So, I would give this a two.\nindustrial designer: One.\nproject manager: You?\nuser interface: One. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Me too. One.\nmarketing: One. Um, but where where is the?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Next, six. It does not get lost easily.\nmarketing: So Yeah, did we implement uh the sound?\nindustrial designer: Uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Just a small thing. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No, we did not. So, but can it get lost if it's such a thing?\nuser interface: Yeah, but uh Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Ah. Yellow.\nproject manager: I don't think so.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Looks like a pistol.\nproject manager: Yes. Not a not a normal shapes. So \nindustrial designer: Uh It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch.\nproject manager: No. It won't get lost.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Uh \nmarketing: It won't.\nproject manager: A one? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, o one.\nproject manager: Okay, a one.\nmarketing: One.\nproject manager: Next.\nmarketing: Okay, um well we aimed for the younger market.\nproject manager: \nmarketing: Uh yeah, did we achieve that. I think with the way it looks and um it is designed, I will give it a two.\nproject manager: Yeah me \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Me too.\nproject manager: That was our target. Two.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Yeah? Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Right. There's a fancy look-and-feel.\nmarketing: Uh, yes. That that was uh, yeah, one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said. I didn't uh say it in my presentation. But um, well does it have that? I would say yes. So um Well, let's also give this a two. T\nindustrial designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber. It feels soft. Uh, it looks like a l uh uh b uh, a bit like a joystick. It's Yeah. Yeah, f very fancy trendy.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yes, a one.\nproject manager: I say a two. It's a a bit personal. If it's fancy.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: So I think s two is better.\nuser interface: Yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Two is okay.\nmarketing: Okay. Two.\nindustrial designer: .\nmarketing: And um, then the last one I could think of, uh it goes with the latest trends.\nproject manager: No, it's new. Innovation.\nmarketing: If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people, and they ate uh fruit and vegetables, well it has a um a nice colour, uh well compared to food but we didn't uh We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: So, I would did not give this uh a one or two. I We'll go for a three.\nproject manager: .\nindustrial designer: I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round. Uh, the latest trends are soft things, you know, like uh I said in my presentation. Uh \nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: But the the colours are um basic, like yellow, red, um blue. Something what also younger people want. It's also a trend, so I'll give it a two.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm, three.\nproject manager: Me too. Three.\nmarketing: A three.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Okay. So um, come back to the presentation now. So, we find yourself there, and now we have to calculate an average rating.\nproject manager: Effort is three, ten and twelve. Thirty, forty, fifty, .\nmarketing: So, we will do that. Yes.\nproject manager: Twenty one. So, it's uh two and three nine two and one third.\nmarketing: By nine.\nindustrial designer: Two.\nmarketing: Yeah. Um, uh okay. Two.\nproject manager: Yep.\nmarketing: Come on. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh, nah. Okay.\nmarketing: So uh, that's a pretty low rating, I think.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, it's good.\nmarketing: So, according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Thank you.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, I think .\nmarketing: Oh. Nah. How am I doing? Yes.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: And I closed your slide-show.\nproject manager: Back to my uh \nmarketing: Which one was the last for you? Uh, dreaming.\nproject manager: Yep. Next please.\nmarketing: Next. Finance.\nproject manager: So, now uh we have a product. Very happy. But uh, is it cheap enough? Um, so if uh I'll have a look. We have a battery. One battery.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Cheapest there is.\nproject manager: Okay, one battery. Electronics. Advanced chip.\nindustrial designer: Expensive.\nproject manager: Yeah it's the most advanced. Chip-on-print. We have that one.\nindustrial designer: Well, it's the most advanced.\nproject manager: We have the simple, regular and advanced.\nindustrial designer: Advanced.\nproject manager: We have the adva advanced. 'Kay, so uncurved or flat. Nope. Single curved or double curved? We have double curved.  {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Then we have plastic, wood, rubber.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we have half rubber, half plastic.\nuser interface: Mm, yes.\nproject manager: No titanium. Special colour. Yes, yellow.\nindustrial designer: Uh, yellow. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm, yeah.\nproject manager: Interface, push-button. Scroll-wheel, integrated scroll-wheel push push-button, or L_C_D_ display.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels? Or one?\nindustrial designer: One.\nmarketing: One.\nproject manager: And it's not really a s\nindustrial designer: Joystick uh thing.\nmarketing: .\nproject manager: Yeah, it's this one. Now, uh button supplement.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Special colour. We already Uh, that's the from the for the buttons. The buttons are regular colour.\nuser interface: Mm, yeah.\nproject manager: So, then uh then then then then then then Then \nindustrial designer: We're not gonna make it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh, no. It's too expensive.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Wh\nproject manager: So, we have to change something.\nindustrial designer: What what are the costs?\nproject manager: Fifteen Euros.\nindustrial designer: Fifteen.\nproject manager: Yeah, well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel, it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber, special colour.\nmarketing: . We would have uh n\nindustrial designer: A special colour.\nproject manager: Oh, no, we \nindustrial designer: Uh, I don't think it's a very special colour.\nproject manager: No, it's uh Sorry?\nindustrial designer: Yellow? Uh, is it a special colour?\nmarketing: For a remote control.\nindustrial designer: What?\nmarketing: I've For a remote control, I think it is. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick. For up down left right.\nproject manager: Um, then we uh lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. So \nindustrial designer: And what if we use only one sort of um Um just only plastic or only rubber?\nproject manager: That's one Euro.\nindustrial designer: One Euro discount. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So, I don't think that's good. Mm I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. If \nindustrial designer: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up, button down, button right, button left.\nproject manager: Yes. Then it's only thirteen Euros.\nindustrial designer: And then we'll lose fifty cent in what?\nproject manager: So uh yeah. Yeah. Then you have Or you have to cut this off.\nindustrial designer: Uh uh-uh.\nproject manager: Then it's not good anymore.\nindustrial designer: No.\nproject manager: So, wait. Okay. I'll have a look. We \nindustrial designer: And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour, wh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yellow rubber.\nindustrial designer: No one will see it. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, normal.\nindustrial designer: Normal colour, and the the joystick away, and put the button up, button down, right, left.\nproject manager: Uh \nindustrial designer: And it's twelve Euros, I think.\nproject manager: One minute, please. Uh Is it maximum. Um Yeah, it's normal colour. But if you lose the joystick, it's still uh an advanced chip?\nindustrial designer: No. Uh, no, no, no.\nproject manager: Or it's then a regular?\nindustrial designer: Uh Oh, wait wait wait.\nmarketing: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it?\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah.\nproject manager: So, the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: And what if we lose the L_C_D_?\nindustrial designer: If we lose the L_C_D_, then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Yeah, regular chip. But Is it a good design?\nindustrial designer: Uh, yeah. Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television. And you don't have the L_C_D_.\nmarketing: If uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So, the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date.\nmarketing: If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons, we would have uh, we have thirteen Euros?\nproject manager: Mm, yes.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: And then uh we move the the colour. What will that be?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Then it's okay.\nindustrial designer: Huh. No knew that.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, so no joystick. Oh no, but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, then it's twelve Euro fifty, then it's okay.\nproject manager: Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. Twelve and a half Euros. Then it's okay. So, we have to change that a little bit. And you cannot use the red and green button. Because if you give them a s uh colour,\nuser interface: Okay. All the same uh \nproject manager: you have to pay point two Euros.\nindustrial designer: So, all the buttons has to have to be the same colour.\nproject manager: Yes.\nindustrial designer: But then the print on it will g um change it. Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is. Uh l How you call it?\nuser interface: Mm, yeah. Recognisable. Like what \nindustrial designer: Recognisable, yeah.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah. Mm, yeah.\nproject manager: So \nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: So Well Now we have to change that, but that's okay. Rubber. What's the normal colour?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh, well that's clear.\nproject manager: So And \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Where's? Yeah. So, now it's \nindustrial designer: And the joystick away. And its buttons.\nproject manager: Yeah. It is. But then it will be just that ones.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Now it's \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: still, he waited at the {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Very good.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Now, uh project eva evaluation. Well What do you think of it? Uh {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: About the\nproject manager: About the project.\nmarketing: Project.\nindustrial designer: process. Went good. Uh I think uh the creativity uh was good enough.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: We have a gun instead of a remote control. Um Uh leadership. Yeah, you were the project project manager, and uh had the final vote.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So yeah that was clear. Team-work okay. Everybody uh has something uh to say about it. And uh no, uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult. But, nah. New ideas found. Nope.\nproject manager: Okay. And you.\nuser interface: Yeah, well the same. I I espe I especially uh liked the the means, the the SMARTboard and uh Yeah, it uh It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices. I think um Well, the laptops if you have them out front of you, you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation. Um, well uh the draw-board, well you can draw things. But it not really going very convenient.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Uh, maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there. And with a normal mouse. Um, and uh the project. Yeah, I agree on what was said uh mainly. Uh, yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others. And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking. To tell their opinion.\nproject manager: Okay. Well, what do I have to say. I think it was good. Not too many discussions.\nindustrial designer: No.\nproject manager: So, it's good for the speed.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Yep.\nproject manager: So, I think we're ready.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Good price.

По-друге, відділ маркетингу розробив оціночний тест, опираючись на тренди ринку та смаки клієнтів, і команда поставила від одного до семи балів кожній функції продукту. По-третє, виявилось, що поточний продукт перевищує бюджет, тому вирішили відмовитися від джойстика та використати лише один матеріал звичайного кольору, але погодилися залишити РК-екран, а також вдосконалені мікросхеми. Нарешті, команда надала позитивний відгук про проект і процес."}
{"fname": "product_dev_110", "dialogue": "project manager: Okay, so now we are on the conceptual design meeting. Uh y getting close to the last\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: is the penultim meeting. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: How was lunch? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm great. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Thanks {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Don't be sarcastic. Mark. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design, first Rama then Mark and then Sammy.\nmarketing: Uh Rama.\nindustrial designer: Ramaro.\nproject manager: Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes.\nuser interface: Mm.\nproject manager: So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept, so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case. And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements. And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing. It's So, let's go. First with Rama. Participant two.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, participant two. Component.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yep. So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy, and the material and interface. For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities. First one, we can use simple battery, or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic, rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\nmarketing: Ah.\nindustrial designer: and then uh titanium, which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display. And we can use some , moving kind of thing. So, as we discussed before, we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control. So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors. And we also want to look at our remote control, so. Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range, like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that. So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm, okay.\nindustrial designer: So uh we discussed an Excuse me. So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and so we would like to just use simple battery. And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes.\nmarketing: What is a double-curved shape?\nindustrial designer: Like you can have two curves.\nmarketing: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: Why?\nindustrial designer: Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic. So, we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: we want to reduce uh cost.\nproject manager: Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber, if it is something that it seems to be light.\nmarketing: The cost.\nindustrial designer: Uh Uh And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\nproject manager: Okay. You m titanium it's more uh \nindustrial designer: and Yeah.\nuser interface: W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm like this?\nproject manager: Yes so mm \nuser interface: to make it feel better and to you know \nindustrial designer: Like in cell phones recently\nproject manager: Uh-huh.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: these you can with the rubber in four directions and \nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay. \nindustrial designer: yeah. But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: rubber is expensive\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: And this push buttons\nproject manager: Uh yeah so\nindustrial designer: we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money\nproject manager: Okay, s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated.\nindustrial designer: for S S\nmarketing: Speech \nindustrial designer: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, and still we have \nindustrial designer: so \nuser interface: mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display?\nmarketing: L_C_D_.\nuser interface: L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_.\nindustrial designer: Uh l\nmarketing: Seems not, it's either L_C_D_ or push-button.\nindustrial designer: So uh\nuser interface: No,\nindustrial designer: it's like a \nuser interface: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus.\nmarketing: Ah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and \nuser interface: Okay, so let's try it, let's t\nindustrial designer: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display\nmarketing: The L_C_D_ would \nindustrial designer: or this inter\nmarketing: The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, it's it's not gonna be a touch pad, uh just a display for giving you information.\nmarketing: Just uh for output, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Ok Yeah, that can we we can consider,\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: because like it won't take much money I guess,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: because \nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Okay, yep.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: You have any further questions or?\nmarketing: I guess no um. So the batteries uh are going to be very light.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: for really light batteries and with uh good price.\nmarketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically, instead of clapping why not just be ask.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five, six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent. If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology\nproject manager: Okay,\nindustrial designer: and so \nproject manager: for the location. Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something.\nmarketing: Okay. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. So let's now go to the you don't have more question?\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: No, it's okay.\nproject manager: Um mm thank you mm.\nuser interface: No more questions.\nindustrial designer: Yep. Thank you.\nmarketing: Puts less of constraint on what we can do\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: but\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: it's always like that. We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, but mm.\nindustrial designer: Oh. We have uh some limitations . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Anyway. Yeah.\nuser interface: But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice,\nmarketing: L_C_D_.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: L_C_ {vocalsound}\nmarketing: L_S_D_ is something else,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and it's quite nice as well. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I'm an artist, sorry. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So,\nproject manager: Um yeah.\nuser interface: So uh, that's not \nmarketing: go on uh artist. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I hope that's not too much.\nproject manager: Now let's talk about uh interface.\nuser interface: Okay. Uh participant number three.\nproject manager: Three.\nindustrial designer: Three.\nuser interface: Uh\nproject manager: Which one? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: mm mm uh have a look at this \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: no it's yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Uh so the concept of the interface. Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface, but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls. So let's start with this. We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and uh we got explanation for every button\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button, I don't know really where it is, maybe one of this buttons, and um power on and off mm I I don't remember\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off? Or no? I can see nothing. So that's our concept. It's called the millennium remote control.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Let's change millenniums. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: maybe you can use in the end and {vocalsound}\nmarketing: doesn't make sense. This is very ugly.\nuser interface: Really? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I thought you like it. Ah okay\nmarketing: Oh no,\nuser interface: just press the button, please uh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: too much concept.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Ah.\nindustrial designer: Uh \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah, we will not use this. We will not use this.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But instead of this I will devise That's our concept.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah, back today. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And it's got just few buttons, quite low looking, and all this stuff we already we already discussed.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. 'Kay.\nuser interface: And uh what will people say? They'll say it's perfect. Or what will say? Uh they will say it's splendid. And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Do you think it can come in several colours?\nuser interface: And everyone's gonna be satisfied.\nmarketing: Or did the \nuser interface: I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours.\nmarketing: Um but not the case.\nuser interface: Not the case.\nmarketing: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: like \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Because apparently from your survey people like colours, no?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, well they like uh something which is uh \nuser interface: Okay, so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels.\nmarketing: Mm yeah, okay,\nuser interface: Do you like it?\nmarketing: so that would be the option. I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it's uh \nmarketing: but I don't use that but again, uh I might \nuser interface: That's why you don't have it. That's why,\nmarketing: Yeah,\nuser interface: 'cause it's nasty. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: bu but {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But it would be expensive, no? If you use colour L_C_D_.\nuser interface: No.\nindustrial designer: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly.\nuser interface: Um, I am here.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So users have different I mean they have their own interests, colour interests and so \nproject manager: So?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: So we can just if they want they can just pay another two Euro.\nproject manager: Uh-huh, okay, so\nuser interface: 'Kay.\nproject manager: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah yeah yes. If they want like uh so that we can yeah.\nmarketing: Kind of upgradable uh remote control.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Wow, wow.\nindustrial designer: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours.\nuser interface: Okay, what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact, um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, and depending on the temperature,\nindustrial designer: Lights, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: And thermodynamic also. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Like a chameleon.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah.\nuser interface: We can make it in fact.\nproject manager: Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive, yeah.\nuser interface: If if if the \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: okay.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,\nproject manager: but \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: so \nmarketing: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people. Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature. My remote control is pink. Nobody else than me has a pink remote control.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And that makes me special.\nproject manager: Okay\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that.\nproject manager: Okay, so\nmarketing: Those who wanted to have it pink.\nproject manager: so i it's not uh a s base service\nindustrial designer: Uh \nmarketing: No mm no.\nproject manager: it's a \nuser interface: So,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: be an option,\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: yeah.\nmarketing: It might be optional, yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: But those people will be really few, no? So like we can those \nmarketing: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends.\nindustrial designer: Ah.\nmarketing: Although similar but have something just slightly better. Pink {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: So m so\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah,\nmarketing: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: yeah. But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time.\nproject manager: And you'll be different.\nuser interface: And it makes you different,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: you know?\nmarketing: You always have your remote.\nproject manager: Uh in the train uh, hello uh no. Want to change my neighbour.\nuser interface: Anyone has their remote controls here?\nmarketing: Oh, you don't? Yeah. You don't have your remo {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod. It's a kind of remote control. Uh it's white\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control. White.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Could we integrate something into our remote control, something like light?\nmarketing: Seems important.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: That they can use it in darkness, like. Hand light,\nmarketing: Mm glow in the dark,\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nmarketing: so \nindustrial designer: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so that like at least um \nproject manager: Iradium? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah sorry. Mm.\nindustrial designer: that \nproject manager: Okay. So mm \nuser interface: Okay. S well,\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: let's go on maybe with the presentation.\nmarketing: Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah sure. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And um the remote control's going to be smart\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nuser interface: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And uh\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I dunno\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that's a question to you and to mm to \nmarketing: Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition.\nuser interface: Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I dunno. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm, that's a nice world. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So just just just just think about it um.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Thank you.\nmarketing: Don't touch the remote.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: But yeah. Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want.\nuser interface: Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart.\nmarketing: Like with some Maybe fingerprint recognition or \nuser interface: Voice recognition is quite tough. I say don't use it, and the control just looks.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it.\nmarketing: Um Mm.\nindustrial designer: Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess, like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use \nmarketing: Okay. So it could be smart in that way.\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah, yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm. Okay.\nmarketing: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have. S since it it knows who is using it, it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah, sure.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and provide you ways of using them, I dunno, somehow,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I dunno, that might be expensive\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: but\nindustrial designer: Uh it's \nmarketing: that might also be a good sales pitch again.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: The remote that knows you. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, thanks.\nproject manager: So it's \nmarketing: My turn?\nproject manager: yeah, Marketing Expert.\nmarketing: Okay, it's alright.\nproject manager: Participant two?\nindustrial designer: Four.\nproject manager: Four,\nmarketing: Four, I think.\nproject manager: sorry.\nmarketing: Trend, yeah. No uh yes. Okay, so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control. So, next slide please. So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple. Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know, so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing, and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them, always, like a phone. We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired. Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends, they're inventing it, they're creating the trend. I hope I'm going to try to help you on that. This is more risky because you're not following the trend,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: you try to invent it, which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So anyway uh next slide please. Uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to. The first one, which seems to be the most important one, is that it has to be fancy, it has to have a fancy look and feel. And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing. It has to be fancy. Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically i innovative,\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important, which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control. So as you see uh it first have to be very nice, s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends, huh, mine has this and not yours. And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Next slide please.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing. If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan, well, it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: or so. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And I think of course uh i it applies to everything. That's the thing with trends. It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Fruit and vegetable. Think fruit and vegetable. And uh if we co we compare to last year, now it has to be spongy,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: What is spongy?\nmarketing: yeah. Well\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah\nmarketing: this so so I think uh uh i\nindustrial designer: kind of um maybe \nmarketing: When we were talking about rubber,\nindustrial designer: Yeah it \nmarketing: I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. We need to think about mm mm.\nmarketing: Seems not, seems not.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um sorry Mark.\nmarketing: So {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It seems to be \nmarketing: Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy,\nindustrial designer: Fruit. Even shape?\nmarketing: as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow. I mean \nindustrial designer: More \nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nindustrial designer: yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Hmm. You're old-fashioned.\nmarketing: So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought\nproject manager: Sorry. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but that's that's fashion and {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Okay that's all I have to say.\nproject manager: Mm you have questions?\nindustrial designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people? Or it's \nmarketing: These I'm sorry.\nindustrial designer: This you you so did you \nmarketing: Yeah, yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world, of course,\nindustrial designer: Where? Oh. Oh, okay, mm-hmm.\nmarketing: as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends\nindustrial designer: It's not from mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: that are also \nindustrial designer: It's more general trend\nmarketing: well.\nindustrial designer: it's not particular to the remote control.\nmarketing: No, it's not it's not this this is very general, yeah. But it seems that trends travel across things.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Yeah.\nmarketing: The what we \nindustrial designer: Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy\nmarketing: Sure.\nindustrial designer: or \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah yeah.\nmarketing: We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables\nindustrial designer: yeah, yeah sponge, yeah yeah at least that's \nmarketing: but we still have to put our chips inside, so of course.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah\nmarketing: This is your problem.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: that yeah yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: This is not mine. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, looking yeah fruit. These things can be easily incorporated. We can have t colours or this shape\nmarketing: Yeah, I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material.\nindustrial designer: or at least \nmarketing: If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay?\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: No more question? Okay.\nmarketing: Yep. Thanks.\nproject manager: So Mm-hmm. Okay, so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again. Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design,\nindustrial designer: Look and feel de\nproject manager: um Mark the user interface design, and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation. Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Hmm. Mm sounds interesting. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: Thanks. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So, can we highlight the specific features of our \nproject manager: Yeah you're right, you have to {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: yeah, so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables,\nproject manager: So\nindustrial designer: that's \nproject manager: you say s\nindustrial designer: we want to follow general trend.\nmarketing: Spongy.\nproject manager: S\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: do we agree on that? Yeah. We have to.\nindustrial designer: So, do you think \nmarketing: No, we don't have to,\nuser interface: So we have to uh for \nproject manager: No. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but seems it's the trend.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yeah.\nmarketing: Again, as I said we can also try to make it, to create the trend.\nuser interface: yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So there's no Well, that's you t can try to convince us.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well, we can make it smell like fruit. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay. that's a good idea,\nproject manager: Okay, that's a good idea.\nindustrial designer: That's {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So titanium smell like fruit.\nmarketing: I {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So what about location and these things, people are really interesting on those features? Or they really like They more want these fancy features\nmarketing: Uh I think i\nindustrial designer: like \nmarketing: yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Feature Yeah.\nmarketing: because we have it\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and others don't.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: It's fancy. Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I I agree with uh this uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nproject manager: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness. Do we take titanium smelling like fruit, or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Uh we will try to explore these two options\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: and \nmarketing: Maybe you could explore the two option.\nindustrial designer: yeah yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Could we make a titanium shape? I mean fruit-shaped.\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape \nuser interface: But Doub double-curved.\nindustrial designer: yeah it's it's\nmarketing: Mm. Seems to be .\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah that's a we're to look for \nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive\nuser interface: Okay, okay. In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body.\nindustrial designer: and d Hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-mm. Okay, so\nuser interface: Well, okay w we'll see.\nproject manager: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two.\nuser interface: Yeah\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Or or spongy an yeah. \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or \nuser interface: We'll see. We'll see.\nmarketing: If you have time.\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose. If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: but uh it cannot be both.\nuser interface: We'll see. I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: For creation.\nuser interface: I dunno uh yeah um\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: we'll look.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Even design. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You can paint it afterward .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, okay.\nmarketing: No problem. We have a very large department of paint.\nproject manager: Yeah, do don't worry, you you you speak with mm mm.\nmarketing: You will do it. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Alright, alright.\nproject manager: Okay. So explore a shape.\nindustrial designer: So still we want to keep L_C_D_? Or \nproject manager: Mm I think it's what we say, that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information.\nindustrial designer: \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Not uh \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, then we can \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: yeah, yeah, that user friendly\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: or \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: That's the converse to having zillions of button\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: where each button does only one thing.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah yeah j yeah,\nmarketing: Classical, we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel.\nindustrial designer: because Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Anyway it's very in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So. Because the trend goes faster than the life of the {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So it's very \nproject manager: Okay. So\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: are we \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: mm.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, we're done.\nmarketing: We're done.\nproject manager: Okay.

In the beginning, the group focused on industrial components: energy, material and interface. The industrial designer preferred traditional batteries, titanium and simple push buttons so that they would have enough money for speech recognition. After that, the group talked about LCD display and locating methods. The second topic was user interface concept, which was basically a good-looking design with few buttons. The group decided to change the colour of the assembly at an extra charge to meet special needs. To make a smart controller, they mentioned speech recognition and user identification. When it came to trend watching, the marketing put forward three noteworthy aspects - being fancy, technologically innovative and useful. The group agreed to follow the trend but the specific design was not decided.", "zh_summary": "此次会议主要讨论了产品的概念设计。首先，开发团队讨论了产品的各种部件：电源、材料和用户界面。产品设计部倾向使用传统的电池、钛金属材料和简单的按钮设计，从而节约成本来开发语音识别功能。之后，开发团队讨论了液晶显示器（LCD）和定位功能。此次会议的第二个议题是用户界面的概念设计问题，他们大体上决定减少按钮数量，设计美观的遥控器外壳。开发团队决定，为满足用户的特殊需求，用户如能支付额外的费用，即可自行改变组件的颜色。为了增加遥控器的智能属性，他们表示可以添加语音识别和用户识别功能。当谈到当前的潮流趋势时，市场营销部指出了三个值得注意的方面——美观、创新和实用。开发团队一致同意跟随潮流趋势，但具体设计还没有决定。", "fr_summary": "La réunion portait principalement sur le design conceptuel.

Uh we'll begin uh with the front. We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape. Um with uh the upper part being the front. Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic, the front. And uh we're we're using different colours. Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: But basically, different colours, bright colours not black, too dark. Fancy colours. Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device. Uh which is of course um part of the back actually, because it's also titanium. You can see it also on the on the on the side view, that only this part is the front, and the rest of it, the under uh the under side uh of it, yeah, the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium, and has the titanium colour of course, the look. Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back, part of the titanium uh titanium part.\nuser interface: Yeah, it's a double R_, but \nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nuser interface: It's a double R_.\nindustrial designer: It's a double R_. Yeah the logo \nuser interface: But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, alright.\nindustrial designer: Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small, but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there.\nproject manager: Okay. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner. Then we have the buttons. Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons.\nuser interface: Oval yeah.\nproject manager: Alright.\nindustrial designer: So uh oval, n those are here. And then we have the m The m\nuser interface: Channel up and volume?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the the con the the the, yeah, the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here. Um um with kind of arrow shapes, which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons. And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on. We have the Okay button. Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators, of the channel and uh volume um changers.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: And then we've here the Menu button and the \nproject manager: Alright.\nuser interface: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen.\nindustrial designer: And the video button. The \nproject manager: So \nmarketing: Mm right.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. And of course this low part, this is the L_C_D_ screen.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Uh this is what we made of it. You can make uh suggestions uh if you want.\nproject manager: Well if I look at it, the side the side view \nuser interface: Well, at the back {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and then you can add suggestions.\nproject manager: Oh yeah alright. Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick.\nproject manager: \nindustrial designer: Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front?\nuser interface: No the back. With the logo and our uh l uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah the back. Yeah. We thought about Yeah, uh the back is of course totally titanium. And we thought about the logo big in the middle.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Just so again the double R_. We have then the logo on front and on the back.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Maybe that's too much\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: but you have to say uh say that if you think that way.\nuser interface: No I don't think And the \nindustrial designer: And the company slogan, we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo.", "en_query": "Summarize the presentation on the prototype.", "zh_query": "总结关于产品原型的介绍。", "fr_query": "Résumez la présentation sur le prototype.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте презентацію прототипу.", "en_summary": "The Industrial Designer introduced the prototype of the product.

{"fname": "product_dev_1", "dialogue": "project manager: All hooked up. Okay, so now we are here at the functional design meeting. Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the sh shared documents folder. I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Did anyone?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: No.\nproject manager: No. Oh well. Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there, there's a shared project documents folder. Um and it should be in there.\nuser interface: Mm. Um um wi on on a what? Oh project project documents, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Project documents, yeah. So I'll put it in there.\nuser interface: Oh okay, yeah.\nproject manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe, to let you know it's there?\nuser interface: Yes, I think so.\nproject manager: Yep. I'll do that next time. Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through, and then I'll send them to you after the meeting. The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, so we'll go through each of you one by one. Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. I just sent\nuser interface: Yeah, the last minute, yeah,\nproject manager: at the last minute, I'm sorry about that,\nuser interface: yeah.\nproject manager: but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Um and then we need to, by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group and functions of the remote control. And we've got forty minutes to do that in. So I would say \nindustrial designer: You said uh targ target groups,\nproject manager: yeah?\nindustrial designer: what does that mean?\nproject manager: As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to,\nuser interface: Um \nindustrial designer: Uh okay, 'kay.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: So are \nproject manager: So we need to yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself. So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you. Does anyone have a preference for going first?\nindustrial designer: Alright. I can go first,\nproject manager: You wanna go first?\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: Okay. Hmm.\nproject manager: Okay, so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I assume we just pull it out?\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right. Um so f from the \nproject manager: Just before you start, to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back,\nuser interface: Okay, yeah, afterwards, yeah, okay.\nindustrial designer: Right sure.\nproject manager: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down.\nindustrial designer: Uh okay. So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design, functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other. So this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role. Um the identification of the components, uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person. Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: and uh basically update and come up with a new design, so it's a cyclical process. Okay, so these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email. Uh I just quickly jotted them down. Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other. Um okay, so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated, so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control. Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television, because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television. How however, our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television, in order to keep things simple. Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard. Okay, so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control. Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interf interface communicates with the chip, so I'll basic go over to the Okay. So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell, uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip, which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So whe when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code, which is then communicated to the remote site, which h has an infrared receiver. Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating. Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger, basically.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible. This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time. And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design, so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions. That's about it. So anything that you would like to know or \nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Thanks.\nproject manager: Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point?\nindustrial designer: No, I don't have any idea about what each component costs.\nproject manager: Br\nindustrial designer: Um yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. 'Cause that's something to consider, I guess, if we're if we're using more advanced technology, it might increase the price.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Certainly, yeah. So so tha yeah, we definitely need to operate within our constraints,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: but um unfortunately I I do not have any data, so uh I just identified the functional components for that.\nproject manager: That's fine. Are there any more questions, or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end?\nuser interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, okay.\nproject manager: Yeah, I think that will do. Okay, so do you want to \nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah, I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue \nproject manager: Yes, shall shall we pull this up?\nuser interface: okay, yeah.\nproject manager: I think that has to come out of there.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm 'kay.\nuser interface: Thanks.\nproject manager: Yeah, I thought those last minute things, they're gonna hit you the worst. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh i Okay, I hope wait. Should it just \nindustrial designer: I it'll take some time.\nproject manager: It ta takes a little Oh, and have you \nuser interface: There's just nothing.\nproject manager: you need to then also press on yours, function F_ eight,\nuser interface: Oh right, right, right, um \nproject manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight.\nuser interface: Okay. Nothin\nindustrial designer: Oh, there it is, yeah.\nuser interface: okay, something is coming up.\nproject manager: Now it's coming,\nindustrial designer: It'll come up, it um uh no signal.\nproject manager: computer no signal.\nuser interface: No signal? Why?\nproject manager: Maybe again?\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, it says something now,\nuser interface: Oh. My my computer went blank now.\nindustrial designer: adjusting \nproject manager: Okay, adjusting.\nuser interface: Adjusting. But I don't see anything\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: There we go, there we go.\nuser interface: I don't see anything on my computer now.\nindustrial designer: Oh, that's strange.\nproject manager: Oh, if you press if you press function and that again\nuser interface: This is the problem, but \nproject manager: there's there's usually three modes, one where it's only here, one where it's only there, and one where it's both.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nuser interface: Um .\nindustrial designer: And one more time.\nproject manager: Okay, so one more time.\nuser interface: Uh now it's okay. No? No.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Should yeah just wait for a moment, adjusting.\nuser interface: Oh okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Okay, that's fine, that's good. Okay, let's start from the beginning. So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up. Um 'kay, so the method I was um adopting at this point, it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls, uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used. And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities. And yeah, and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set, so this quite straightforward. And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. Um um I als\nindustrial designer: Sorry, cou could you go back for a second?\nuser interface: okay.\nindustrial designer: Uh switching on off channel, uh volume, okay, that's great.\nuser interface: 'Kay. Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design, like operating a V_C_R_, but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players, but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them, but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something. Um then yeah, the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel, and then volume has to be there. But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu. And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So at the for the time being that's uh that's all.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: If you have questions \nproject manager: If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management, but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_, I could get back to them and see. It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about.\nuser interface: Yeah, and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever, so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things.\nproject manager: Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay.\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one?\nindustrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. Um but um so so at this stage, uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that?\nuser interface: Um well, I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: I mean um what other options would you have? A little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user\nindustrial designer: Yeah, and it'll make the costs yeah.\nuser interface: and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly, not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons, but if if you have other mm proposals um.\nindustrial designer: Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Uh i if the if the costs allow, we can have like an L_C_D_ display\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well. So yeah? Cool.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Yep.\nproject manager: Sure, we can discuss that maybe after the next one.\nmarketing: Cool. Do you wanna give me the little cable thing?\nproject manager: Do you want to yeah.\nuser interface: Uh am I going in the right direction?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: No. Wait.\nproject manager: Oh, I'm getting hungry. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, here it comes. Okay, here you are.\nmarketing: Cool. Ah, that's why it won't meet. Okay, cool.\nproject manager: You set?\nmarketing: Yep, cool. Okay, functional requirements.\nproject manager: Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here.\nmarketing: Alright, yeah.\nproject manager: Hello.\nindustrial designer: try to press \nproject manager: Is it plugged in prop\nindustrial designer: oh, okay,\nmarketing: It's working.\nproject manager: it's working?\nindustrial designer: yep.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: Cool, okay.\nproject manager: Excellent.\nmarketing: So what I have, wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire. Um so it was all about, you know, how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control, you know. What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control. Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens, so I should have taken that bit out, but anyway.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um okay, so. What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are, so you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different. Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense. Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know, a nice looking remote control.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um current remote controls, they don't match the user behaviour well, as you'll see on the next slide. Um I dunno what zapping is, but \nproject manager: It's um switching between channels, sort of randomly going through.\nmarketing: Oh, right. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. Um okay, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: so that's going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: they just make it look ugly.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Okay? Cool. Um so this is my little graph thing.\nproject manager: Ooh, that's a bit difficult to see.\nmarketing: Mm k\nproject manager: If you explain it to us it'll be fine.\nmarketing: Okay, well, I can send it to all of you. What it is is um it's cones,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting. Um but \nproject manager: I liked the, I liked the litt\nmarketing: ooh where's it go?\nproject manager: ooh come back.\nmarketing: Back. Oh.\nproject manager: No.\nmarketing: Oh yes, cool. Okay, I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Um okay, so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: What you can't see is volume selection, it's a little bit higher than all the others.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm, that's the next one along, yeah? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, so what the graph shows is that, you know, power, channel selection and volume selection are important, and the rest of them, you know, nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance, you know,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so on a scale of one to ten, how important is that\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: and, you know, channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential, and the power, well it's not quite so essential, apparently, although I don't understand how it couldn't be,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: um and everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control, 'cause they're just not needed, and they're not used. Okay.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing. Okay, cool. So um okay, so this is what people find annoying about remote controls. Uh that they get lost, that the uh you know, they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know, watching T_V_, then that's the least of your problems,\nproject manager: The remote control. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but you know, it's up there.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Um that yeah. Okay, so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that, like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages \nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know, not straining your wrists watching T_V_.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Yes. Okay, cool. Right, um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table, and I didn't have time to white it out again.\nproject manager: That's alright.\nmarketing: Um okay, but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software. So you can see from that that, you know, younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software, whereas as people get older, they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it. Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about, but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_, you know, tends to be people talking and um, you know, how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Um okay? Cool. Um okay, so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool. Um you know, functional, so it's useful, but minimalist. Um there's a there's an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you're filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, and you've got all this stuff, and you're just like, what the hell is that, who is ever gonna use it? You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, so I think we need to aim for both.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Mm.\nmarketing: Um okay, then a long battery life, like you were talking about earlier and um, you know, I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there, and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um and then like a locator, so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or \nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: not a mobile phone \nindustrial designer: Some kind of a ring,\nproject manager: Keys and things like that,\nindustrial designer: some \nmarketing: Yeah, that's it, you know.\nproject manager: yeah. Whistle and it screams at you, yeah.\nmarketing: I know, it's weird. My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps, something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_, you know,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: So okay? Cool. That's me. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay, that's great,\nproject manager: That's you, excellent.\nuser interface: Um that's very good,\nindustrial designer: thanks.\nproject manager: Um.\nuser interface: very interesting.\nproject manager: I'm just gonna tick yes. So, we've got about ten, fifteen minutes to discuss\nindustrial designer: Mm. I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people.\nmarketing: Cat's. Ca.\nindustrial designer: So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned, if we want to have something sleek and uh you know, good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know, people who are comparatively elderly. Um.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah, I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: but I'm assuming, you know, yes.\nindustrial designer: Right. Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so if you want to put in something stylish, then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket\nindustrial designer: Right, and \nproject manager: and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions.\nindustrial designer: Right. Mm.\nmarketing: Well, that's when you go to uni, isn't it? So, you know \nproject manager: Yeah, but you don't have much money, generally.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah,\nproject manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five, when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and \nuser interface: you share a television or something that yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But uh still, if if you can go back to that slide and uh, how popular was it?\nproject manager: O oh it's on \nmarketing: Oh, I've unplugged it.\nproject manager: sorry, we unplugged it.\nindustrial designer: Oh, oh, okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Do you want me to \nproject manager: Here, let me \nindustrial designer: That's alright, if you can just look it up on your computer, wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five, uh how popular was \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Seventy six point three percent.\nindustrial designer: so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them.\nuser interface: It was seventy something, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: So even they are seventy six percent, is that high amount?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah, I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean, you know, if you're at university, you're paying your rent,\nproject manager: Yeah, they've got no commitments and\nmarketing: but you don't have a mortgage, you don't have a life insurance policy,\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: you don't normally have a car,\nproject manager: usually not a car and all of those things.\nmarketing: yeah, so.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: You're still learning to drive actually,\nproject manager: Kids. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: So you're more likely to b\nmarketing: so that just costs more than a car,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but yeah. Um so I mean like it is an age group to target, really, I think.\nproject manager: Yeah, and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price, that's not unaffordable, even for young people.\nmarketing: No, I mean that's what, that's like fifteen Pounds? You know, I think \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah this this is not unaffordable,\nproject manager: \nuser interface: but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah, I d I don't know many people without a T_V_. We didn't have a T_V_ last year,\nproject manager: But do they \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and everyone thought we were off our heads, you know.\nproject manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah\nuser interface: Common, the students yeah, yeah. The s the stu\nproject manager: and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote.\nuser interface: yeah, and the remote control might not yeah,\nindustrial designer: Mm\nuser interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular, right?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah,\nindustrial designer: So mm uh are are are \nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: we're still yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh \nmarketing: I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot really.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: You know, so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore, you know.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: because actually I mean they're all still re young people.\nmarketing: Is not a massive difference, you know. No, do totally.\nproject manager: Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Um {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs?\nindustrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features, but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it? Uh and uh \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though, don't you? Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But how frequently do we use it anyway\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and um uh h ho how good is it,\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh \nmarketing: I don't know.\nproject manager: Yeah. With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five,\nuser interface: An\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: S so \nproject manager: louder,\nindustrial designer: Right. Okay.\nproject manager: tha that should be relatively simple.\nindustrial designer: O {vocalsound}\nmarketing: y you'd maybe need a code word. Do you know what I mean?\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: So like when you say change, except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_,\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: so maybe like, you know, remote. I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_?\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Although I only watch Charmed, so really I wouldn't know\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine.\nindustrial designer: Right. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay, so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nproject manager: Um, so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money,\nuser interface: Yeah but uh um Yeah, yeah sure, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls.\nuser interface: Yeah, w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons\nproject manager: Yeah,\nuser interface: and um, yeah it's it's kind of safer, so we we need both,\nindustrial designer: Mm. W\nproject manager: I think we need both.\nindustrial designer: What uh \nuser interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra, it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say, I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five.\nproject manager: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, so if uh if something like that can be incorporated, {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, that would be another way to do it.\nproject manager: So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great.\nindustrial designer: some kind of \nmarketing: Yeah, but then the code word would be even more important, because I mean Sky advertise on every channel, don't they, you know,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed, and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky.\nproject manager: Watch Sky and yeah.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that's \nmarketing: and that would be really annoying. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. But that's definitely a possibility.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away, so it might not pick up the other things coming from there.\nmarketing: Yeah. Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though?\nproject manager: So that you can yell at it,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah, you know, so you have to have the remote control.\nproject manager: yeah.\nmarketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Alright.\nuser interface: Yeah, but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television, because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control, so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself.\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then \nindustrial designer: Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\nproject manager: Mm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: being cl I mean it'll it'll mm.\nuser interface: No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and uh not to yell at it from the distance.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm. So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control, wherever it is, it'll beep,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: so we we can probably come to know where it is.\nproject manager: That's \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: but then if you're buying the remote separately,\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: but y you could have something, but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something,\nuser interface: Oh yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nproject manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack, so one part attaches to the T_V_.\nuser interface: Okay, yeah, mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah, 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control.\nproject manager: The l\nindustrial designer: Alright, yeah.\nproject manager: Well that's right, but it solves the problem of having different noises.\nmarketing: Yeah, definitely, yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah. Okay, I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um. But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the buttons so it's easy to use, but only those key buttons, the major buttons and then one sort of menu one, and then voice recognition included as an option\nuser interface: The major ones, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, which y you'll get immediately by email. Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes, and then we've got a lunch break\nindustrial designer: \nproject manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder, but I'll send you an email when I do it, so that you know.\nindustrial designer: So where exactly is this i\nproject manager: It should be on your desktop, so on the \nindustrial designer: Ah, okay.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them.\nuser interface: Did you find it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah in that one,\nuser interface: It's just yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: right yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah, and email them round.\nmarketing: Oh, so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there, hey?\nproject manager: Yeah, that would be great.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there,\nproject manager: Oh yeah, put them in there. Yeah,\nuser interface: we we yeah, w we won't even okay.\nmarketing: There you go.\nproject manager: then you don't have to email them.\nmarketing: But is everyone's called functional requirements?\nindustrial designer: No.\nproject manager: No, they're all called something slightly different. Technical requirements and something something, yeah.\nmarketing: Okay, so that's good.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: That's me done.\nproject manager: So, if you put them in there, we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to.\nmarketing: Okay, cool.\nproject manager: Um as to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: Yeah? Whatever that means.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I guess I'll find out. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept,\nuser interface: Uh something conceptual, yeah.\nproject manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: um we'll keep keep our options op hmm?\nindustrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into? Con components, oh.\nproject manager: Components,\nuser interface: Hmm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: yeah.\nuser interface: Sorry, but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our \nproject manager: No, we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare,\nuser interface: To prepare, okay, yeah, that's good.\nproject manager: so that's fine, w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary.\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay? Right on time.\nuser interface: Cool. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay, so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay, see you.", "en_query": "Summarize the whole meeting.", "zh_query": "总结整场会议。", "fr_query": "Résumer toute la réunion.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте всю зустріч.", "en_summary": "This meeting was about functional design.

Mm.\nproject manager: We put the fashion in electronics.\nmarketing: That's uh the motto of our company. Yeah, well do we do this with uh this product? I um Yeah.

Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So, well we gonna do the next part. Uh, yep. Uh uh, the next statement. It has not too much buttons. Um, yeah, I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better. And in the end we calculate an average. So, um that's why it's a negative in it. Um, well this one of our aims not have too much buttons. So, um uh did we uh do that? Well, uh if we go to uh this fashion, I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers.

Yellow.\nproject manager: I don't think so.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Looks like a pistol.\nproject manager: Yes. Not a not a normal shapes.

Uh, the latest trends are soft things, you know, like uh I said in my presentation. Uh \nmarketing: Yes.\nindustrial designer: But the the colours are um basic, like yellow, red, um blue.

A real high-tech version of it.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: But um\nmarketing: So that would \nproject manager: it's like the hand dynamo, no?\nindustrial designer: Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand\nmarketing: So, but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay, we only \nindustrial designer: is \nmarketing: We we win one.\nuser interface: Okay,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That's already that.\nproject manager: Uh it's a it's a beginning.\nmarketing: Okay, let's do that.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Why not.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Let's do that.\nproject manager: So One here and here.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just remo\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nuser interface: And I propose to \nindustrial designer: S\nuser interface: So uh, about chips. Advanced chip on print, right?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: So, put minus one there, please. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: I'm not sure if this is legal.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: That's right. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Why not?\nindustrial designer: Uh, no.\nuser interface: And?\nmarketing: And?\nproject manager: M maybe minus uh three, no? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: No. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So, was there result?\nindustrial designer: No, no. It's not \nmarketing: Okay, let's see.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm.\nuser interface: Let's have a look.\nindustrial designer: It's not changing, no?\nuser interface: Why?\nindustrial designer: It you don't\nmarketing: Yeah, yeah, yeah, if Click somewhere, you'll see features.\nuser interface: Oops.\nmarketing: Yes, it does.\nproject manager: So {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Maybe put minus two, so it looks uh more reasonable. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah. Why not.\nmarketing: Yeah, anyway \nproject manager: Oh, sorry.\nuser interface: Minus.\nmarketing: No, minus two.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Nobody will know.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's not recorded, is it?\nuser interface: Good.\nmarketing: Okay, we're on time.\nproject manager: Okay. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Good.\nindustrial designer: So now on, we can increase our Still you have two more. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh, we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want.\nindustrial designer: Maybe we can use it for our party.\nproject manager: Oh.\nuser interface: And a battery and a battery, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Both its it's cool. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: No, now we are exp exceeding I think.\nuser interface: Now it's fancy,\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: let's add one instead of two. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah, that \nmarketing: It Is it? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah y\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think we're exceeding now.\nindustrial designer: No, but point five point three.\nmarketing: We have to remove the \nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Uh, it's better. I think they are counting uh \nproject manager: Yeah. Mm. It's maximum\nindustrial designer: Is really strict?\nmarketing: We would prefer,\nproject manager: and don't have to Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nmarketing: yeah. Maximum is maximum.\nproject manager: Uh \nindustrial designer: Oh yeah.\nmarketing: So, remove one of them. Yeah. Okay. Okay, we're uh on target.\nproject manager: Uh, mm-mm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Mm. So target reached. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm just curious to see this\nindustrial designer: Ho {vocalsound}\nmarketing: uh my address chip on print.\nproject manager: It's um English uh Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Trick. Uh, I would say it's the Russian trick, but\nproject manager: Yeah, but uh is uh English. So \nmarketing: Anyway No,\nindustrial designer: Oh. Uh \nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well, I don't know.\nmarketing: they may have some their origins, strange origins \nuser interface: I don't know. I am not sure who was programming this calculator, you know. 'Cause uh I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number.\nproject manager: Mm, let's try.\nmarketing: No, no, no.\nindustrial designer: And we can discuss all these things in our party.\nmarketing: Let's finish this meeting instead. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay. I save it uh \nmarketing: What else?\nproject manager: Okay, so next mm {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: No, that's yours.\nmarketing: This is right.\nproject manager: Sorry.\nmarketing: Okay,\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nmarketing: so finance, that's done. Are the cost under twelve?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah, very much.\nmarketing: Yes. Project evaluation, good. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.

{"fname": "product_dev_23", "dialogue": "marketing: That went well, thank you.\nproject manager: That's great.\nindustrial designer: 'Kay.\nmarketing: Perfect.\nproject manager: Alright, let me just PowerPoint this up. Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design, don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is, it's just something important that we need to do. Um, think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete. In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype. Um. Right so um, apologies for the last meeting, it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough, um, so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting. Um, fair enough, thanks for the input,'s always good. Um. So, basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time, um, and gonna go through you, uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting, possible directions. And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work. So, perfect. So, without th further ado, whoever wants to go first is free to.\nindustrial designer: I'll go first.\nproject manager: Alright Nathan,\nmarketing: Go ahead.\nproject manager: take it away. It is Nathan right? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again?\nindustrial designer: No Nathan's fine.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Good.\nindustrial designer: It's either Nathan or participant two.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mister participant two that is. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nice.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Um,\nproject manager: Nice.\nindustrial designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: so Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that. Um, components of a remote control, okay. We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon. Energy source, um, our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources, your standard battery, solar cells. Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route, we might have to look elsewhere. Um, and also there's a kinetic energy possibility. Basically, it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running. So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: So we'll have to look into that.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Um, the case, we have a few options, plastic, rubber or wood. Um and then as far as the way it's shaped, we can do standard boring flat, which we probably don't wanna do, curved or very sexy double curved.\nproject manager: What kind of th thickness are we looking at?\nindustrial designer: Um, I imagine that we could specify. Um, I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres. Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay, brilliant.\nindustrial designer: Um, the buttons, there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer, but to use those we'd have to use more chips, um and that would cost us more. And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: Um and just a little note there,\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. Nice.\nindustrial designer: Um, one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum. So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that. And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light. Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote, just kind of as a fun gimmick.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it.\nmarketing: Interesting.\nindustrial designer: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that.\nproject manager: M Maybe \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm. Good call.\nproject manager: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Choose it.\nindustrial designer: I am sure that we could do that. Um, of course \nproject manager: Yeah I like the idea, it's a good idea.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, just as a fun gimmick.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Just to set us apart a little bit. Um, and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use, also known as the chip. Uh, we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um findings, okay, we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer, um and my question to all of you is, should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available?\nuser interface: Interesting question.\nindustrial designer: 'S a bit of a challenge question.\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints, is that really a feasible option?\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Right, that's my concern too. Um, if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer. My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table, uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route, just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on. Uh, I like the idea of the visible light signalling, that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes. So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know, say our the one \nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Can we do marketing piloting too? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received?\nmarketing: Um It's an option, uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now\nproject manager: Okay. Okay.\nmarketing: which actually might even come into play beforehand,\nproject manager: Okay, perfect.\nmarketing: it may help us decide for now. Temporarily anyway.\nproject manager: Great, thank you very much Nathan.\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah, you're welcome.\nproject manager: That's perfect, so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here.\nmarketing: I guess so, 'cause I found some interesting things. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Did you? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You waiting for me? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Fascinating, compelling even.\nmarketing: I know, what a teaser ain't it. Um. Right. So\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: current market trends. Screen. Um, basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields, to see sort of what's what's trendy, what's new, what's happening. Um, remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer, fancier, more exciting they're sick of this boring, normal, functional, um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface. Um the challenge is that current trends right now, across the board in fashion, in furniture, in technology, is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Now I'm not saying we should have, you know, tomato shaped remote controls or anything, but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours, like if wood is an option, that whole organic, sleek, clean,\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: v line thing may be something we can look into. Different skin options, or if we can't afford this touch plate thing, or touch face screen interface um, maybe having the b images be specific, like you could choose your menu bullets to be\nproject manager: Tomatoes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: a different shape\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: or okay, not the example I would choose, but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I like it, I like it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: uh not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting, I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin, but like a holder almost if you could do like um, leather options or wood options or something \nindustrial designer: Hmm. I should have mentioned this um. As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls.\nuser interface: Yes.\nmarketing: Mm. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Slick, slick.\nuser interface: Fabulous.\nmarketing: Might be an interesting way to go. Um, yeah so something to sit on for now. So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding, everyone's looking for easy to use, technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Um.\nproject manager: Interface, oh the interface graphics for the um \nmarketing: Yeah. Um. Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable, something that you can drop and it doesn't matter.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: 'Cause so many \nmarketing: True.\nindustrial designer: you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls.\nmarketing: Very true. Very true.\nproject manager: Yeah, it's like, yep {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Taped with duck tape and what have you,\nmarketing: Very much so. Um\nindustrial designer: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber.\nproject manager: it's ubiquitous isn't it?\nuser interface: We can have a duck tape casing.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We could.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something, a new line,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It could go with the granola crowd.\nmarketing: but worth a shot.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah, it could be, it could be,\nproject manager: Great,\nmarketing: um. Yeah that's what I know.\nproject manager: thanks for that Sarah.\nmarketing: No problem.\nproject manager: Ron?\nuser interface: Phew. Computer's adjusting. One moment please. So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So yur user interface, guys, is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear, or otherwise uh perceive. Uh, commands and mechanisms, that basically user uses to control the operator operating system. Here's a d series of different remote controls\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that are out on the market today. I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look.\nproject manager: Yeah\nuser interface: Um, so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts. Uh voice recognition, we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment. Um, so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples, um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control. Now our design team, research team, has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses. Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice, Good morning Joe. Um.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team\nuser interface: On the remote control\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: at the {vocalsound}\nuser interface: right.\nmarketing: Yeah. Very true, very true.\nuser interface: Um, another concept is what uh Apple has come up with, the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: which I am sure most of you know about.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button, kind of like a modern a bit bulky, a bit crazy,\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: I don't think that's we're necessarily going for.\nindustrial designer: No.\nuser interface: And uh some special components, uh ideas like uh blocking, having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue. Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose.\nproject manager: Yeah, I can see. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um, again probably not what we're going for\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas. Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it\nmarketing: Mm, right.\nuser interface: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line. Uh touch screen interface, um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen, uh, the important ones like power, volume and jump between channels. Um, and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\nproject manager: Mm.\nuser interface: and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power, um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: has jokes when it's ready.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Nice.\nproject manager: Great.\nuser interface: And uh that is about it.\nproject manager: Great, wonderful Ron, cool. Lot of good ideas, good facts to have.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: That's what they need, it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time, just connect it, my kingdom.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm.", "en_query": "Summarize the ideas of the individual presentations.", "zh_query": "总结会议上的个人观点。", "fr_query": "Résumez les idées des présentations individuelles.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте ідеї особистих презентацій.", "en_summary": "According to the Industrial Design, there might be only a few choices for the energy source and materials from the current manufacturer, so he suggested that they had better look for another manufacturer for more alternatives.

{"fname": "product_dev_131", "dialogue": "project manager: So um now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure um \nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Of the technical function, so uh\nmarketing: So I think it's you, huh?\nindustrial designer: Uh it's\nmarketing: No? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That's me.\nproject manager: what effect \nindustrial designer: techni function of \nmarketing: No, user requiremen\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay. Wait a second.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Argh.\nindustrial designer: I have to do working design so uh\nproject manager: So you're \nuser interface: That's but this but number three, yes. Mm-hmm. So, my name is Mark Dwight, and um I am responsible for User Interface Design.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: However, uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design. Uh, as I'm a more an artist\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this.\nproject manager: Okay. Let's go.\nuser interface: So next slide please. And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: is not to forget about uh Occam razor. We should never complicate things too much. We should only make a remote control, nothing more. Nothing more than this, just a remote control.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use.\nmarketing: Makes sense. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So, make a click, please. So here is this remote control.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's quite a standard one, but it's not from a T_V_, it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something. But you know, we can use it for a T_V_ easily. Only buttons we need is on off, volume, channels and maybe some options or something else, and please make a click, compared to this one\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's \nuser interface: which one would you prefer? I guess this.\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button.\nuser interface: Sure, sure.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of like, between those two\nuser interface: Yeah, and our method is going to be, provide simple\nindustrial designer: li\nproject manager: Oh sorry. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: simple desires into simple actions.\nmarketing: Nice. Nice sentence.\nuser interface: Findings.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh sorry.\nuser interface: Our question of the style, we should remember that our company\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Concept.\nindustrial designer: S you should yeah.\nuser interface: Be simple. Be simple and you'll lean on this market.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Market is a of remote controls you know it better,\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: it's very well, it's it's not an easy field to to play, you know? So be simple.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's a really good style, it going to be look like like this. It is unbreakable and it is very universal. W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: and we can put all the options into this screen. We'll need only few buttons. All the other things can be controlled through the screen. And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click, 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something, you always try to find a good button and click it, but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch. So Press \nproject manager: \nuser interface: I would propose this concept for design, just few buttons, a screen with a back light which can change colours, titanium\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: I think, and uh what else? I got just very few and good ideas. We need power and volume. And let us include two nice features into this device, first, power on and off can be made fully automatic. When you go to the sofa, take your control and point it to the T_V_,\nproject manager: It's off.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: It's on.\nuser interface: the T_V_ turns on.\nmarketing: And when does it turn off?\nuser interface: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time\nmarketing: Oh so you have a\nuser interface: like uh you \nmarketing: sensing sensor machine that uh knows \nuser interface: It's a question to our technical design, our two engineers.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Tech {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control. Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you. Like, you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something, and then the volume changes.\nproject manager: Or you want to go to the kitchen. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's easy to do,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: you just control the \nmarketing: According to your distance to and the angle maybe, if you have a stereo system.\nindustrial designer: Distance.\nuser interface: According to the distance. Yeah yeah yeah. So \nmarketing: Uh I'm not sure about the screen, wha what is the use usefulness of the screen? Uh is it a touch screen by the way?\nuser interface: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left, right, up, down and enter.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow. \nuser interface: So, its main purpose in fact is a back light,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: which change colours,\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: which makes it easier to find, and each can it can respond for your voice, like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily, yeah?\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: So basically that's it.\nproject manager: Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control.\nuser interface: Can be easily done,\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: 'cause you got simple designs, y we should put it to simple actions.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nuser interface: Let it be universal, so you want to use it for your hi-fi system. You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Just few actions, a few actions for everything.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Hmm. S\nuser interface: All the rest, we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen.\nproject manager: Mm. Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah.\nuser interface: Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: Mm. Yeah and it mm.\nuser interface: Okay, but it's quite universal you know.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: We can just extend it to any device.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five, how would I do can I do that with this?\nuser interface: Uh twenty five.\nmarketing: Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now. You know these days we have hundreds of channels,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels.\nuser interface: In fact I would propose another solution.\nmarketing: Or is it?\nuser interface: Basically you use just four or five channels, right?\nmarketing: Most people \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: yeah.\nuser interface: So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one, two, three and five, and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel.\nmarketing: In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen, instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three, twenty eight, forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button.\nproject manager: Yeah it's it's the same solution, I think. Hmm.\nmarketing: I uh \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: B yeah.\nindustrial designer: But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display, like you can uh de you can just button the number\nmarketing: Go to channel twenty five.\nindustrial designer: and then it go\nmarketing: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap.\nindustrial designer: t because Yeah.\nmarketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels, I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: But still Yeah.\nmarketing: just because this is one kind of thing they do, zapping.\nproject manager: Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: And it's only next.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah\nuser interface: Mm. We got these buttons here. Next next.\nmarketing: so but you have to \nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah..\nuser interface: Or say this can be back.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five\nmarketing: So it would be \nindustrial designer: and then \nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: and you can change mode zapping mode or\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Alright.\nproject manager: uh current chan\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\nmarketing: Listening more.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: so we can have more functions for T_V_\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this, like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four?\nmarketing: Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah.\nmarketing: I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Although I don't know. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Alright?

{"fname": "product_dev_8", "dialogue": "project manager: All set? Okay. Cool. Right. So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control. And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion. So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only. So no we're not doing D_V_D_, we're not doing anything else,\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: it's just gonna be a television remote. Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um so that's red and black. And it has to have the slogan, case you guys forget the slogan it's, we put fashion in electronics. Um and no teletext. I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do, so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design. For reasons that I don't really know. There's but it's the board so there you go. So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote. Anyway. So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on \nindustrial designer: Okay. So do I unplug this bit here?\nproject manager: Oh, right yeah.\nmarketing: Gotta plug you in.\nproject manager: Yep. Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up. Yep. Cool.\nindustrial designer: Okay. Right. That's page one of my presentation.\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nmarketing: Very nice. For your first PowerPoint it's lovely.\nindustrial designer: So the uh method. We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project. Um remote control works as follows. This is all pretty basic stuff you guys. Um sends message to another system, so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power, something along those lines, there's an integrated circuit, which is the microchip, um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. A user interface controls the chip, basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well. So my findings, um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands. And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like, and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer, just think of those lawsuits, that'd be really bad.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction. Um, components. Just some ideas that I had, um, energy source, it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. Um the user interface, I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: The chip, um, silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that, we can't really be different in that respect. Um, the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard, multi channel, that's a word I made up, I don't really know what it means.\nproject manager: 'Kay. Fair enough.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range.\nproject manager: 'Kay.\nindustrial designer: Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices. Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s. Um personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal, um, the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits\nmarketing: Fine.\nindustrial designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value,\nproject manager: Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers, or mo modern types of plastics\nindustrial designer: 'cause we were thinking \nproject manager: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice,\nindustrial designer: Right.\nmarketing: It needs, yeah.\nproject manager: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with?\nindustrial designer: Yeah that shouldn't be a problem. Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do.\nproject manager: Okay, okay.\nindustrial designer: That's the end of my presentation.\nmarketing: Cool.\nproject manager: Great. Thank you very much Nathan. Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: S plug yourself in here. Mm. Um hit function F_ eight real quickly, hold down Mm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Looks like you're in okay.\nindustrial designer: Is it plugged in well? There it goes. Computer adjusting.\nuser interface: Th\nproject manager: There you go. Sweet.\nmarketing: There you go.\nuser interface: Well so. Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation. Um so a few of the requirements we need here. Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device, it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem.\nproject manager: Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before.\nuser interface: Um so some of my findings. Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set. Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television, uh switch to the next channel, that sort of thing, I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does. Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well\nproject manager: Oh yeah look at that.\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it. As you also notice it's quite a boring design. Um. Another remote control, slightly different, it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions, um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use. Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring. So\nproject manager: Nice.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: my personal preferences.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control. Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with. And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: Um. Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh .\nproject manager: Great. Thanks for that Ron.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: 'Kay\nmarketing: Does that mean I'm up?\nproject manager: yep that's you.\nmarketing: I think so. Okay.\nuser interface: I can plug you in.\nmarketing: Oh that would be perfect. Thank you. Slide show up and running.\nproject manager: Give it a little bit.\nmarketing: Or not. Uh. Oh there we go. Perfect. Okay. So this is me. Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices. Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's used to using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, m the majority of the time that's all that's going on, the other functions happen, for some people they're important, but the primary uses are really really basic. Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use, they're not using a lot of it, they don't need it, they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with. And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people, their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, will really come into play with a lot of these people. Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful, and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically, that's up to the design people, but it is s something worth thinking about, especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing, so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about. Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards. So it's a good start for us.\nproject manager: That's great. Thank you Sarah. Right. So um\nmarketing: Need to unplug this?\nproject manager: yep I'll just uh switch that back here.\nmarketing: Need it back.\nproject manager: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase.\nmarketing: There you go.\nproject manager: Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Um Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to, you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted, thought about voice control,\nmarketing: Oh right.\nproject manager: um so do we wanna go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic, and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. Um. So\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well, we've got this idea, Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um,\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly.\nmarketing: Uh.\nproject manager: Um so um. How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable, um at least for the basic controls, maybe we can balance it that way, you know we can see.\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but we might be able to say um volume up.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right. I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology.\nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Oh. That could work. I like that.\nindustrial designer: With a simple command like locate. And then it could start to beep\nmarketing: Yeah. Something very basic.\nindustrial designer: and\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Right.\nindustrial designer: therefore be found.\nuser interface: Sounds good.\nmarketing: Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then?\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah I think that's very doable.\nmarketing: Okay.\nproject manager: The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find. 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away \nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's a good point.\nproject manager: If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button, maybe that could be voice activated too.\nuser interface: A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television.\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: And you just say something to into that\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: and it\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: finds your \nmarketing: K {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Or an isolated magnet or something like, or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: but yeah I like that, I like that, the voice recognition for the paging system.\nuser interface: The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control. So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market.\nmarketing: True.\nuser interface: And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k\nmarketing: Making it just an option?\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nuser interface: exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not.\nmarketing: Yeah. Right.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I was thinking uh \nmarketing: Are we still thinking about this screen sorry.\nindustrial designer: Oh go ahead.\nmarketing: Go ahead. The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing, it would be still, do we know if that's an option technically right now to that?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: 'S definitely an option technically. I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not,\nmarketing: Okay. Okay.\nuser interface: they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point.\nmarketing: We're doing okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions, you can have\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition, settings, things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for.\nindustrial designer: Gotta wonder though, if we're adding so much technology to this one remote, are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: True. Worth looking into.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It seems like, we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: True. Yeah.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: So it's just something to consider.\nproject manager: Absolutely. Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know, that's perfectly viable question. Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group, aim it at them, but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many,\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well, we don't have many um.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I appear to have lost my microphone. Mm. Right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool. Um right. I guess we've c we've touched on most of this. The idea of a paging function, a touch screen, and face plates. Um. The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen?\nuser interface: Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct,\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable.\nmarketing: Mm. Just the casing.\nproject manager: Okay.\nuser interface: We could have the casing, the the face plates.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: Back to the uh the cost the material. We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package? That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates, it's gonna drive the cost up.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm.\nindustrial designer: And the other question is, if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether \nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Okay.\nindustrial designer: See if there if there's even interest out there.\nproject manager: Okay. Right.\nindustrial designer: Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere.\nproject manager: Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all\nmarketing: Mm. Right.\nproject manager: it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it, we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around, it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ \nproject manager: Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.\nuser interface: Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: True. True. True.\nuser interface: and most people have their televisions in the living room. Uh. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth, um.\nmarketing: Yeah. Oh yeah.\nuser interface: Sure.\nproject manager: True, if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important. Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing, n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations?\nuser interface: Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um \nproject manager: Yeah yeah okay. Um \nuser interface: Interface?\nproject manager: Yeah I think that would be best. Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost, try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea. With a touch screen for the basic functions. Um And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen. Um do we have Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls. Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost.\nmarketing: True. 'Cause it would have a docking base?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. But then again that costs as well.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen?\nproject manager: Do they? Okay.\nuser interface: Those new ones.\nindustrial designer: Can we afford to include one of those?\nmarketing: Can we afford that?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And will somebody buy it if we don't? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Okay so let's go with a um touch screen with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology \nmarketing: For twelve Euros? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into, if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\nmarketing: It is. Fair enough.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you know so you know. Well yeah I mean\nmarketing: The basics.\nproject manager: you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know, you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery, focus on um uh presentation.\nmarketing: 'Kay.\nproject manager: Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off, channels, volume, um\nindustrial designer: Right.\nproject manager: and um a small paging function. Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging. Just a beep.\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nproject manager: Um right so any comments? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this.\nindustrial designer: Since we're doing uh touch screen, do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody.\nuser interface: Be interesting.\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: What what would be on that touch screen? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\nmarketing: And oh.\nindustrial designer: logo or something or motto, I can't remember exactly what you said.\nmarketing: Yeah the the fashion\nuser interface: We put fashion into electronics.\nmarketing: do. Yeah.\nproject manager: W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control.\nmarketing: Right, and then you're dealing with ports and cords and \nproject manager: Yeah I think perhaps \nindustrial designer: 'S too much.\nproject manager: good idea but yeah\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: I think that that one m might just be um and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular \nmarketing: For now.\nproject manager: a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but I dunno, what do you guys think?\nindustrial designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen.\nmarketing: Yeah. Nice.\nindustrial designer: That'd be okay.\nuser interface: Yeah. Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that, I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device.\nmarketing: Um. Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\nproject manager: Hmm.\nmarketing: and then it goes away, perhaps it could be like a temporary \nproject manager: Mm.\nmarketing: Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think.\nindustrial designer: Mm. True.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah.\nuser interface: I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Y {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah. Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Jus\nmarketing: Yeah you would think.\nproject manager: But apparently not.\nmarketing: But.\nproject manager: So.\nindustrial designer: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on.\nmarketing: If it comes from above.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: They just want it to be on and ready to go.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well fair enough. Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on. But then again who wants to turn on a remote control. Kind of if i\nuser interface: Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on.\nproject manager: Oh\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode.\nuser interface: Yep. Goes into a sleep mode.\nproject manager: Okay. Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen, nice. Um. Um cool so any last things before we break? Alright. Fair enough. Sounds good.\nmarketing: We're good?\nproject manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders. I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference.\nuser interface: I've put my files in the shared folder as well.\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: That's fab guys.

But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people, less than more than \nuser interface: Okay, then teletext is used less.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nmarketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think,\nuser interface: Okay.\nmarketing: yeah. Because they they have other means of finding their information. Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm-hmm mm mm. Okay.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: That's good point.\nmarketing: But yeah. Nope.\nindustrial designer: Mm, yep.\nuser interface: Mm. Okay.\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: 'Kay?\nindustrial designer: Thank you.", "en_query": "Why did the marketing think they should aim at young people?", "zh_query": "为什么市场营销部认为他们应该以年轻人为目标群体？", "fr_query": "Pourquoi le marketing a-t-il pensé qu'il devait cibler les jeunes ?", "ukr_query": "Чому маркетолог вважав, що потрібно орієнтуватися на молодь?", "en_summary": "Because in general the early adopters of a new device were young people and teletext was used less among the young than the elderly.

{"fname": "product_dev_16", "dialogue": "marketing: Okay. Oh I totally Yeah 'cause I moved it. 'S put it over here. Then we don't have to worry about it.\nuser interface: Ready for this?\nproject manager: All set? Cool. Alright, it is PowerPoint time. I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: which is kind of fun.\nuser interface: Oh man. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um, I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me. It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting.\nindustrial designer: Oh really?\nproject manager: I think. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay.\nmarketing: Huh.\nproject manager: I don't know. Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes, s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, uh, I will open them slowly, no? Wait for it, wait for it. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah that's not you. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No. That's how the \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Wait.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: This is, this is very high-powered stuff here, double-clicking, there we go. So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer, uh or from Nathan, and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under, what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition, I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice. That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users. Um, and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at. So. That's sorted, back to the main meet here, um, go ahead and take it away guys.\nindustrial designer: Well. Uh, we have assembled our prototype, um. What's to be said about it? Um, we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting, um. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see\nproject manager: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions, um. This is going to be the on off button\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here, d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons. And then, for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on. But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away, um. As far as the uh whole visible light thing, we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah.\nproject manager: Nice. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: why not?\nmarketing: Fair enough.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Of course, if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off. Um.\nproject manager: Perfect.\nindustrial designer: Go ahead.\nuser interface: No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: um f we call it fruity\nmarketing: Right.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: if you will. Um. Right, um,\nmarketing: Appropriate, okay.\nuser interface: of course that's uh interchangeable\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\nmarketing: Mm 'kay.\nuser interface: but this is kind of something that can be done\nmarketing: It is an option.\nuser interface: um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there.\nproject manager: Oh, right.\nindustrial designer: That's this here.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Ah. I see.\nuser interface: Um. So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption. Um, what other things do we see here, well, um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: um, so I think that will work well with regards to our market. Um and uh let's see, well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available. Um uh do you have anything else to add to that?\nindustrial designer: Um I worried about the materials, it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh, it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped. Um, and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel.\nuser interface: It's actually important to note that the television, uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that, that i it actually is edible inside.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Fact, I dunno if you noticed, but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen,\nproject manager: Oh well done yeah, yeah oh ok\nindustrial designer: I thought that was kinda nice.\nmarketing: Nice.\nindustrial designer: This was actually an apple on the inside.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: This \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Do we need to worry about um rot factors? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh\nmarketing: Oh okay, there's preservatives involved,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: polymer yeah.\nmarketing: we don't need to worry,\nindustrial designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves,\nuser interface: It's fine.\nmarketing: okay.\nindustrial designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that, but \nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: Fair enough.\nproject manager: Edible televisions, it's a wave of the future. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No but \nuser interface: It's pos a possible new product.\nmarketing: It's a couple years off at least. Okay.\nuser interface: Um, but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote,\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature. Um, did we come in under budget?\nindustrial designer: Uh we did, yeah. This cost well to put this into um production, we're looking at about what was our goal? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um, so I was quite pleased with that.\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: One thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons, but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down.\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nindustrial designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology, um for example the voice recognition,\nmarketing: Mm.\nindustrial designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper.\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: Mm. Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option?\nindustrial designer: And Oh no, we haven't talked about that yet have we?\nuser interface: So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay.\nuser interface: and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Um, but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with. Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier\nmarketing: Mm 'kay.\nuser interface: and um, I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Yeah.\nuser interface: And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um, so.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: Cool.\nindustrial designer: Any questions?\nproject manager: No, no\nmarketing: Do we have um other, for lack of a better word, skins? Covers?\nproject manager: I think that's {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or?\nindustrial designer: Um, do you wanna answer this one\nmarketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet?\nindustrial designer: or do you want me to answer it?\nuser interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material uh.\nmarketing: Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah.\nuser interface: Oh I see,\nmarketing: I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: right, um.\nindustrial designer: Um, well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like \nmarketing: Okay. Just veneer really,\nuser interface: Right.\nmarketing: yeah. Okay.\nuser interface: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that.\nmarketing: And the whole thing \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay\nuser interface: So I mean there are I \nmarketing: Right\nuser interface: we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials\nmarketing: Yeah. There's Okay.\nuser interface: which I think worked out fine. We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green.\nmarketing: Mm 'kay. Okay, very cool.\nindustrial designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate, it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it, it locks into place such that, you know, it's pretty permanent but at the same time, if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way\nmarketing: Okay.\nindustrial designer: if you know what I mean.\nmarketing: Yep. It's still an option if we need it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Very cool, nice job.\nproject manager: Right, yeah thanks guys that's very, very good work. I like it, brilliant. Um, what we need to discuss now is the finance of it, um I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance. Um, it's a spreadsheet of the parts {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh.\nproject manager: and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um.\nindustrial designer: Ooh.\nproject manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly, but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here, we've got this it's a solar cell thing right?\nindustrial designer: Right\nproject manager: With a back-up battery?\nindustrial designer: uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there,\nproject manager: With the ba okay. Um\nindustrial designer: yep.\nproject manager: and \nuser interface: The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area. Yeah.\nproject manager: Clever, clever, well done. Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, yeah. It's just making use of the same space and the same materials,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Okay. Um and the case, it's more of a single-curved case, I guess would be that be the general \nindustrial designer: Yeah, one big curve I guess you could say.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout. Um. Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we?\nindustrial designer: Yeah, mm-hmm.\nproject manager: Um. And um a special I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout,\nindustrial designer: Yeah, special.\nproject manager: yeah.\nindustrial designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well, don't you? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional,\nproject manager: Yeah, it's it's quite unique.\nindustrial designer: I like to think of it as unconventional.\nproject manager: I like it, yeah it's So it looks like\nmarketing: M come in at sixteen?\nproject manager: a bit over budget, um.\nindustrial designer: Oh. Huh, doesn't match up does it?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery. Uh \nindustrial designer: How do you feel about that?\nuser interface: I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features, being environmental and without the batteries and what not, although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: what am I gonna do?\nmarketing: Mm k.\nindustrial designer: People'd be real upset. I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery,\nmarketing: True.\nindustrial designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have.\nproject manager: Hmm. What's difficult, we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now,\nmarketing: Nah.\nproject manager: it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way. Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it, um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural, new thing, but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly.\nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nuser interface: I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing\nmarketing: I mean \nuser interface: I mean that's what sets us apart\nmarketing: Which, it's \nuser interface: right?\nmarketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market, I mean that's where we started from, so I don't know, and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: And the reality is you know, for me from an ideological stand point, I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell, but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here\nmarketing: Right. Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Right.\nuser interface: and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here\nproject manager: It's either or.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: and maybe move ahead with the project, without the solar cell.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. I guess we might have to do that.\nmarketing: I think unfortunately that's our best option.\nindustrial designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it? Of twelve fifty.\nmarketing: Mm.\nproject manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah,.\nmarketing: It kind of \nproject manager: um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the \nuser interface: Savings.\nmarketing: yeah.\nproject manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a mm-mm, um, nor would changing the case materials.\nmarketing: Mm-mm.\nproject manager: Um. So yeah that looks like to be the only thing. So that would be the \nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: it's a major change but Yeah. Alright, so\nindustrial designer: Gotta do what you gotta do.\nproject manager: we're in agreement on that.\nmarketing: Unfortunately I think we are.\nuser interface: No, I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah.\nproject manager: Right. Moving along swiftly. Um, so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over.\nmarketing: That would be me. Um cord?\nproject manager: Ah of course, sorry.\nmarketing: No problem.\nproject manager: Whoosh.\nmarketing: Can you reach,\nuser interface: Yep.\nmarketing: that would be great, thank you.\nproject manager: That'd be great {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I didn't even do that one on purpose either,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: damn. Okay, um, basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do, these are the things that look like we feel they're important. Um so I was looking at basic design things, does it fulfil its functions as a remote? Is the design what we wanted it to do? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for? Um. Basic questions like, you know, does it turn on? Does it respond to voice recognition? And overall, in general, it looks like it's coming up to par.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Um, the only thing is with with the pull-out panel, that is, can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface, um that looked like it was coming up rough, but then, once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense.\nindustrial designer: Really good.\nmarketing: So I think overall we're headed in the right direction. So.\nuser interface: They like that spongy feel.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah. It looks like it's going over well, so\nuser interface: And the paging function works well,\nindustrial designer: Six?\nuser interface: that's good to hear,\nmarketing: we're we're good yeah.\nuser interface: we worked hard on that one.\nproject manager: Brilliant.\nindustrial designer: We did.\nmarketing: Yeah. It's I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff, but for now, what we've got is working in the range we need it for, so it's all good.\nindustrial designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel\nmarketing: That's everything from me.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nindustrial designer: but it's okay.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah, it is a set-back, but \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay, do you need the cord back?\nproject manager: Um yeah,\nuser interface: W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again\nproject manager: I was just go on.\nindustrial designer: I know.\nuser interface: that we're \nproject manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they?\nindustrial designer: True.\nuser interface: I guess that's true.", "en_query": "Summarize the review of some problems from the past meetings.", "zh_query": "总结之前在会议上提到的问题。", "fr_query": "Résumez l'examen de certains problèmes des réunions précédentes.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте огляд деяких питань з минулих зустрічей.", "en_summary": "The group briefly talked about their agreements of the past meetings.

{"fname": "product_dev_90", "dialogue": "marketing: For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the \nindustrial designer: Yeah.

Yeah.\nproject manager: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You do this?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Uh no.\nuser interface: I usually just change channels.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Because I'm only using three or four channels but {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit.\nproject manager: Yeah. I change channel like this, m uh I want to go to twenty five, and then to ten, uh-huh mm yeah.\nindustrial designer: Dash.\nmarketing: And then back to the one I was before,\nproject manager: Also we can be here \nmarketing: so there's whichever it was.\nuser interface: Uh-huh.\nindustrial designer: Yeah you can\nproject manager: yeah, that would be cool.\nindustrial designer: yeah.\nuser interface: Go back button is good.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah. Uh uh we had that in in other countries.\nuser interface: I once had it.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, the previous button is .\nproject manager: Mm yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: Uh, okay. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: History. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Oh uh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions,\nindustrial designer: Uh.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: that becomes more complex,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah, what the which channels the viewer {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-mm.\nmarketing: Yeah {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay.\nmarketing: maybe it's a \nproject manager: So I think we have full of idea.\nmarketing: Okay.", "en_query": "Summarize the decision of the discussion about function design.", "zh_query": "总结关于功能设计的最终决定。", "fr_query": "Résumez la décision de la discussion sur la conception de la fonction.", "ukr_query": "Резюмуйте рішення за результатом обговорення функціонального дизайну.", "en_summary": "The point of this discussion is that the group should optimize buttons and switch designs, adjust the number and size of buttons and their functions, filter out unnecessary functions, reduce the number of buttons and replace them with screens to enhance the applicability of remote controls, just like mobile phones.", "zh_summary": "这次讨论的重点是，开发团队应该优化按钮和开关设计，调整按钮的数量、大小及其功能，去除不必要的功能，使用屏幕代替因按钮减少而缺少的功能，提高遥控器的可用范围，像设计手机一样设计遥控器。", "fr_summary": "Le but de cette discussion était que le groupe optimise la conception des boutons et des interrupteurs, ajuste le nombre et la taille des boutons et leurs fonctions, filtre les fonctions inutiles, réduise le nombre de boutons et les remplace par des écrans pour améliorer l'applicabilité des télécommandes, tout comme les téléphones portables.", "ukr_summary": "Суть обговорення полягає в тому, що група має оптимізувати дизайн кнопок і перемикачів, пристосувати кількість і розмір кнопок і їх функції, відфільтрувати непотрібні функції, зменшити кількість кнопок і замінити їх екранами, щоб підвищити придатність пультів дистанційного керування, як мобільного телефону."}

Yeah that's right.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: and numbers and uh that every culture in uh, yeah, people in every country can recognise.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm.\nuser interface: I also think we should not add too many buttons.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: No that's right.\nuser interface: Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think.\nproject manager: Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's \nuser interface: Precisely.\nproject manager: culture uh international.\nmarketing: Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah indeed.\nindustrial designer: Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh \nmarketing: Yeah right.\nproject manager: Yep, and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player. Don't we have uh other uh ou\nuser interface: Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use, we uh we make?\nproject manager: Uh.\nindustrial designer: And stereo uh s uh audio installations.\nproject manager: We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw.\nmarketing: Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yep.\nuser interface: And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes. So we can keep that in mind.\nindustrial designer: Most people do, yeah.\nproject manager: Well yeah.\nindustrial designer: It doesn't \nproject manager: It doesn't have to be, but we can.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it doesn't have to be \nuser interface: W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it.\nproject manager: Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_.\nmarketing: Yeah but \nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah alright, but \nmarketing: We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh \nproject manager: Yeah because we look at competitors\nindustrial designer: Well.\nproject manager: and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design \nindustrial designer: Hmm.\nmarketing: Yeah but it's it has to be useable.\nindustrial designer: It has to be different and familiar at the same time.\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: Yeah. Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: we could use another form or shape or colour, that kind of things.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: yeah the shape will will have to be recognised. I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing \nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: you can make it uh triangle shaped,\nuser interface: Well we we could make more more oval or something, and and \nindustrial designer: but that's not uh very recognisable.\nmarketing: No.\nproject manager: Oo\nindustrial designer: Oval?\nproject manager: N we can use uh it as a as a game pad.\nuser interface: Yeah or so\nindustrial designer: I \nproject manager: So one hand has the beer, so the other hand uh {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Well yeah it's new. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: . Not with two hands. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah, right.\nuser interface: but young people want something different\nmarketing: No {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and it is \nproject manager: Well i we already uh \nmarketing: Yeah but it's quite important that it fits.\nproject manager: one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so \nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Oh but it ha it has to be m\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: yeah. But you still have to know it's a remote and not another \nproject manager: Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh\nuser interface: Yeah alright.\nproject manager: because it's a long time uh on the market. So the the form will have been uh tested out so \nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh, yeah, useful\nproject manager: Yes. Well {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: or else uh they would have been ano another shape.\nproject manager: for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them. I have uh have to it has to fit my hands.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah. Yeah\nmarketing: It shouldn't be boxy.\nindustrial designer: a lo the long box shape yeah. You have to use one hand.\nproject manager: It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb.\nmarketing: Nah I don't agree with the long box uh shape {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Why not?\nmarketing: it it has to be custom made for the hand.\nuser interface: Yeah it doesn't fit .\nproject manager: Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this, and you can make it another shape,\nmarketing: Yeah but if you shape it \nindustrial designer: but then you have \nuser interface: No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped.\nmarketing: If \nproject manager: D_V_D_ players. Yes. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: W no w what else?\nmarketing: No that's ol old fashioned.\nindustrial designer: I di\nuser interface: Well Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then?\nuser interface: Yes uh \nmarketing: I can imagine that us\nuser interface: Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end, and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end.\nmarketing: Yeah right. It fits in your palms.\nindustrial designer: Hmm. Well {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: but it's still then uh the the long box, uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand,\nuser interface: Yeah it \nproject manager: Well \nmarketing: Hmm?\nproject manager: A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand.\nmarketing: Um.\nindustrial designer: but it's it's still Yeah yeah al alright\nproject manager: That's \nindustrial designer: but but it's still it's still sort of box, yeah.\nmarketing: .\nuser interface: Yeah yea\nindustrial designer: It it has round forms\nmarketing: Well \nindustrial designer: but it in the end it's still the box, so that's what I mean.\nmarketing: Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand.\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah I understand, but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square\nmarketing: It shouldn't be too boxy, you know.\nuser interface: Hmm.\nmarketing: It's \nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No no no.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but a also with round edges of course,\nuser interface: .\nindustrial designer: but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right maybe something like this\nindustrial designer: Yeah yes {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player\nindustrial designer: I thought about something like that. Yeah.\nmarketing: and so you can I've \nindustrial designer: A big recognisable button on top or something.\nmarketing: Yeah right, and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and \nuser interface: Yeah.\nproject manager: We have five minutes left.\nindustrial designer: The buttons should uh also be not too small, not too big, of course,\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes\nindustrial designer: and uh n uh uh not too close uh together.\nproject manager: uh that's yep.\nmarketing: But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button.\nproject manager: Yep.\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh.\nmarketing: So there has to be some space between the buttons.\nindustrial designer: Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah right right,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: and maybe we should use colours.\nuser interface: Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them,\nindustrial designer: Colours, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Ha.\nuser interface: and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's kinda trendy. Yeah right.\nproject manager: Sound nice. Yes.\nuser interface: I dunno but \nindustrial designer: I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um \nproject manager: Well it's just uh about our first ideas now\nuser interface: Well {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: .\nproject manager: so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Right. But \nproject manager: Yes?\nindustrial designer: Already thought about something tha {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make,\nproject manager: Yes.\nmarketing: so we \nproject manager: Well thirty minutes we have. So um \nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm.\nproject manager: This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh. You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh. I think.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: .\nmarketing: No problem.\nproject manager: Oh and uh that's uh that's all. So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over.\nindustrial designer: Yeah now we can still talk about the material,\nproject manager: Yeah yes say.\nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course, hard plastic, the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh.\nmarketing: Yeah. Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy.\nuser interface: .\nproject manager: Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons\nuser interface: .\nindustrial designer: No n n\nproject manager: and when I've had use it much it was gone. So it has to be made in the buttons I think.\nuser interface: Yeah that's bad, yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah.\nproject manager: It has to uh not be loose.\nuser interface: Yeah that's important .\nindustrial designer: Mm. Alright. And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other.\nproject manager: Yeah. Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh \nindustrial designer: I think so.\nmarketing: Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah.\nindustrial designer: It's a a common stan standard way \nproject manager: It's not that in China it's different?\nmarketing: Yep.\nindustrial designer: infrared beams an infrared beam I think .\nproject manager: Yeah. But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between \nmarketing: And you can use \nindustrial designer: It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country, so \nproject manager: Probably yes.\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: China rules. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works. The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But are \nindustrial designer: but that's pretty obvious, I think. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea?\nproject manager: Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes.\nmarketing: I think we should make it universal\nproject manager: Yeah.\nmarketing: and you can always use a front front on it, you know? You can use it just plain\nproject manager: Yes.\nuser interface: .\nmarketing: but you can To make it more trendy.\nproject manager: Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it, but you can change them uh when you buy the \nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Right.\nuser interface: Yes. Yes.\nmarketing: Right.\nproject manager: And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh \nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nuser interface: Well you can make profit with them, and it's a way to make them trendy.\nproject manager: Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh.\nindustrial designer: Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something\nuser interface: Yeah alright.\nmarketing: Yeah right.\nuser interface: Yeah normal.\nindustrial designer: uh b a simple colour not not very flashy.\nproject manager: Yes. Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell,\nuser interface: No a colour everyone accepts.\nproject manager: so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so \nuser interface: Mm.\nindustrial designer: Pink television sets pink remote, .\nuser interface: Mm.\nmarketing: Yeah yeah yeah.\nuser interface: Yeah. standard.\nmarketing: But people of often don't like bright colours or something.\nproject manager: .\nmarketing: We have to make it grey or s or black.\nuser interface: Well young people s li\nmarketing: Yeah but then you can use a a front.\nuser interface: Yeah yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: Alright.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: I must not forget my pen the next time. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well if if you yeah. {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it. I think.\nuser interface: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah that's right.\nproject manager: But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh. {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah or a t Teletubby front. Yeah yeah yeah. I will investigate.\nproject manager: Yes. Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be, but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote. And you will look into the technical design and um form, I think.\nindustrial designer: Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task, yeah.\nproject manager: Or something like that.

Um, and the technology has definitely been a help, it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff.\nuser interface: We didn't use the whiteboard at all.\nproject manager: No, no whiteboard. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No.\nmarketing: No, we didn't.

So, yeah, I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know, fill in the blanks on your own, level of creativity upped.\nuser interface: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to \nmarketing: Whatever.\nproject manager: Of what to do.\nuser interface: well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm.\nmarketing: Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, that wasn't very much. {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You know \nuser interface: um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was\nmarketing: Mm.\nuser interface: because that was kind of the interface portion\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: which was what the whole project was about\nmarketing: Yes.\nproject manager: Mm, mm.\nuser interface: uh\nmarketing: Hmm, very much so.\nuser interface: but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more,\nindustrial designer: Yeah. That was fun. I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you\nuser interface: which was fine. Mm-hmm.\nindustrial designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time.\nmarketing: Yeah, already having the formatted stuff helped a lot. Very much so.\nproject manager: Cool.\nuser interface: And I think your leadership was quite good.\nindustrial designer: It was really good yeah.\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it.\nmarketing: Yeah. That's kind of a good thing though,\nproject manager: I felt like I slipped into it a lot.\nindustrial designer: It's kinda fun.\nmarketing: you know, give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey.\nproject manager: I dunno.\nuser interface: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role?\nproject manager: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management. I usually organise crap,\nmarketing: Hmm.\nproject manager: it's one thing to do, you know set up a party with your friends,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: you know?\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Little different.\nproject manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the, yeah, suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay?\nmarketing: Yeah.\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and I knew we were all lying through our teeth,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I had to admit, as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh, th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window.\nmarketing: other than that \nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I could only imagine. {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah, yeah.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe in in Legos you know? Be fun with Legos too,\nuser interface: Possibly.\nproject manager: like make a remote control or spaceship, we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos \nuser interface: Oh yeah,\nmarketing: Yeah. Totally.\nproject manager: everybody knows best spaceships ever.\nuser interface: still have 'em.\nproject manager: Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all?\nindustrial designer: Yeah?\nmarketing: I think so.\nuser interface: Yep.\nproject manager: Hmm.\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: No I, no I dunno, I d I I dunno,\nindustrial designer: You don't.\nproject manager: I don't I I was just I \nmarketing: Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building,\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nproject manager: It's true huh?\nmarketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming, use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work, not like three hours' worth of meetings.\nproject manager: Yeah.\nuser interface: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team. I mean\nindustrial designer: Yeah.\nmarketing: That's true.\nproject manager: Yeah. Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like, kind of like, like hmm.\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It d\nmarketing: Yeah that is kind of \nproject manager: But yeah.
