# ConvSumX: Revisiting Cross-Lingual Summarization: A Corpus-based Study and A New Benchmark with Improved Annotation 	

ConvSumX is a cross-lingual conversation summarization benchmark, through a annotation schema that explicitly considers source input context.

ConvSumX consists of 2 sub-tasks: *[DialogSumX](https://github.com/cylnlp/convsumx/tree/main/convsumx_data/dialogsumx)* and *[QMSumX](https://github.com/cylnlp/convsumx/tree/main/convsumx_data/qmsumx)*, with each covering 3 language directions: En2Zh, En2Fr and En2Ukr.
